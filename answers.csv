My grandma’s Alzheimer,Hi everyone. My 71 years old grandma has been dealing with Alzheimer for a while. Should I hire a nurse or should I take care of her myself? Because I don’t know if family members would help with her disease better or not.,Tuff call... There are many variables... A nurse can be very expensive..... so can quitting a good job if you're working. It also depends on how far along she is with her journey. Is she still active or is se bed ridden?
Eye Test Can Detect Alzheimer’s Disease Early,"This looks very promising for proactive treatment of Alzheimer’s in the future. Not sure how much is okay to paste in so I will leave link too. https://hitechs.org/new-eye-test-can-detect-alzheimers-disease-many-years-prior-symptoms-emerging-110002017/ . In a study of 16 patients at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles with Alzheimer’s found they had more than twice as much beta-amyloid in their retinas. Neurosurgeon Professor Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, said: “Analysis of retinal amyloid index (RAI) scores showed a 2.1-fold increase in Alzheimer’s disease patients.” In early human development in the womb, the retina of the eye is formed from the same tissue as the brain. Even before this study there has been a suspicion that there is a link between the ratio of beta-amyloid protein in the eye and amyloid in the brain. There is even a disease reference to 'dementia of the eye' and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is linked to a buildup of beta-amyloid proteins in the retina. The Cedars-Sinai team in an article entitled “Retinal Amyloid Pathology and Proof-of-Concept Imaging Trial in Alzheimer’s Disease” published recently in JCI Insight, say they believe beta-amyloid begins to accumulate in the eyes maybe 20 years or more before symptoms develop in the brain. The non-invasive technique developed by the Cedars-Sinai team with investigators at NeuroVision Imaging, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, University of Southern California, and UCLA have their patients drink a solution containing the natural fluorescent yellow extract curcumin, the main chemical in the curry spice turmeric. Besides curcumin's natural fluorescent glow, in a micronized form it can cross the blood-brain and blood-retina barrier then binds to the sticky amyloid plaques. The curcumin solution highlights the amyloid deposits at the back of the eye using a portable extremity imaging device. We recently reviewed on the best forms of curcumin supplements here. Co-senior study investigator Keith Black, M.D., chair of Cedars-Sinai's department of neurosurgery and director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute stated: ""Our hope is that eventually the investigational eye scan will be used as a screening device to detect the disease early enough to intervene and change the course of the disorder with medications and lifestyle changes.""", 
Can you reverse neurocognitive deficits?,"Just got diagnosed with major cognitive disorder. Diagnosed with Chronic Lyme Disease 2016 mother had Vascular dementia, father has late onset at 83, and multiple concussion histiory read Bredeson's book just had my Apoe4 done waiting for results. Anyone here reverse Neurocognitive deficits ???","Thanks, my friend for posting this I been forgetting a lot of things lately and I am nervous that my memory could be fading on me. I'm 48 years old and I just can not remember things that me and my wife did several years ago including some of the things with the children. I played football in and some in college and yes we used our helmets back then to tackle with.


 Lion's mane mushroom supposedly has neuroregenerative properties. Give it a try. It's one delicious mushroom when briefly sautéed in a pan with some butter, salt & pepper, parsley, garlic, onion. Start with a small dose though as it packs quite a punch! Don't get the dried powder, try to get the fresh one that's still alive. They come in large plastic bags.

 I had started taking lithium orotate 120 mg for foot neuropathy. I had read it would help, but it didn't. But after about 3 weeks, I began to notice my memory improving. I work as a gate guard and people would ask if I didn't remember them. I didn't. But after the lithium I started recognizing them. I have been taking lithium for about a year and have had significant memory improvement overall. I am 66 years old and have signifcant family history of Alzheimers. I have a friend I was telling about this. He is 77 years old and told me he has difficulty recognizing faces and general memory loss. Now after 6 months, he has had signifcant improvement of his memory. His wife has been so impressed with his improvement that she has started taking it just in case. Search the internet and you can find studies that show a correlation between lithium and neuroplasticity. That's the brains ability to heal ie grow new brain cells. I wonder if the aluminum found in Alzheimers brains is the brain using aluminum because there is little or no lithium available. I am posting this hoping to help others and spur research into lithium research for memory disorders.


 Hi kct did you find anything that helped with you cognotive disorder"
Vascular dementia and feeling guilty,My dad is 85 years old and has vascular dementia. In January we had to move him to a home because my mom could no longer take care of him. I live in the US and they live in South America. I went to see them last month and it has been very sad. The place where he is is nice and clean and he has his own private large room and bathroom. The thing is that he does not even remember I went to visit him and it breaks my heart. I talked to a psychiatrist and she told me that we as a family needed to mourn my dad because he was not longer there. She said that we need to take care of his body and needs but that the dad I had is already gone. This was hard to hear but in many ways made some sense. My mom and sister (that lives close by) continues to go there to be sure he is well taken care of and to visit. I do feel so guilty from living so far. Has anyone experience something like this? Thanks.,"Hi AnxietyKeller. I’m sorry you are going through this. I just lost my dad in December 2017 to vascular Dementia and other health complications. It is very hard to go through. It sounds like he is being taken Well care of and has family near by. What helped me in the past years was my dad was always a family person, worked 2 jobs, and always tried to be there for us as we grew up. We had 8 kids in the family. I tried to talk about all the “ good ole days” And times I knew he would remember. Long term memory is easier for them to grasp I was told. It was by no means easy, but hearing his “stories” made me appreciate all he had done for our family. When he stopped talking, I talked about what was going on each day. He loved to hear about golf (he was a golf lover at an early age) , my family, what the other patients were doing down the hall ( he too needed Nursing home care after not being safe in my home after 18 years of living there). I knew he could hear it all. Spend what you can with your dad now. Wishing you peace.


 Hi: No, I for one, have not heard of Terminal Restlessness. You're right. It does sound unpleasant. My Mom isn't at that stage yet. I feel for you.


 It's been awhile since I've posted here. I do see some old friends (Pratoman, Clocknut, and Complier). My husband, Ron was tested again and he does have Mild Cognitive Impairment; however, I don't see this as a topic. Hello everyone!


 Everyone that posts in this Alzheimer's forum has been where you are...or they will be. Sorry you're having to go through it. The good news is that is sounds like he's being well taken care of.


 I recently had to place my husband in a facility. I had stopped working last November to stay home & care for him. He was diagnosed with Dementia probably 10 tens ago. He did well for many of those years. However, last summer he began that snowball down the hill effect. He has Vascular Dementia, his father & paternal grandmother also had dementia. I was told this morning they are looking at what the Social worker called “ Terminal Restlessness”. Has anyone ever been told this about their loved one? He was taken to a behavioral center for about 8 days. They took him off several medications & added back one anti-depressant. He was then brought back to the original facility with the thinking he would adjust better. Things are not as bad as before. However, they have had to place him in a different area of the Alzheimers Unit. They have also spoke of possibly needing to place him in a Behavioral Unit permanently . I googled the Terminal Restlessness & certainly did not like what I read. Has anyone else heard of this? Thanks


 I realize this is a bit of an older original post but I have years and years of experience with a family member who had dementia. Generally terminal restlessness or agitation refers to agitation that occurs near the end of life. Both of my parents had it. I know what you're going through. Sometimes it happens earlier in ppl with dementias. It pretty much means they don't know what is happening and act out. My mother passed away in December after 10+ years of progressive vascular dementia. I don't know how many times I researched the ""stages"" but finally realized the only constant is there is no constant. Every person is different. The best you can do is roll with it and try not to blame yourself. The guilt never really goes away. But it does fade over time. Post Edited (1 day at a time) : 7/21/2020 3:48:23 PM (GMT-6)"
Using Poetry as an Outlet,"Hello everyone. My amazing momma is writing a series about using poetry as an outlet for people who have someone close to them that have Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia. If you're interested in this idea or reading poetry about this difficult topic here's the link to the article: https://vocal.media/poets/lessons-in-forgetting. Below is a little blurb from the article. This won’t be a practical how-to essay equipped with links to the best meal replacement shake for adults or how to prepare to change your own parent’s diapers. Though that’s helpful, I’m hoping to give you the gift of your own writing. A chance to write your way through what is inherently painful and difficult. Weekly, I will post a poem I wrote as an example along with a poetry prompt to get you writing your own truths. In my mid-thirties I said goodbye to my mom and not because she died or because we were estranged. I said goodbye nearly every day for a decade as Alzheimer’s took pieces of her, sometimes large chunks, like forgetting she had children, and other times, small details like people peel bananas before we eat them. Alzheimer’s may enter a room quietly like an electrical fire, but it burns the house down nonetheless. Thanks for reading this post and maybe reading the article, I know my mom is just hoping this puts some good into the world.", 
Concerned about husband’s memory,"In January My husband had a serious fall That resulted in a bad brain injury. Then resulting neck surgery this summer. We’re elderly and have both been experiencing what I consider to be fairly normal memory loss, but after his surgery he has been going downhill at an accelerating rate. He’s scheduled for neuropsych testing in a couple of weeks. He has a speech therapist who comes a couple of times a week to help with balance & other problems and she told me that since June his memory is getting much worse. I had to agree. I forced him to retire in October and we moved his office home but he spends all day in his home office working under the supervision of a fellow attorney. He has made some very serious financial choices with his business. I hear him yelling on the phone, he hells at people who dare to walk on our grass, he acts huffy with me, he isn’t bathing very often, is becoming incontinent and the other day I caught him using my hair dryer to dry the urine in his jeans - while he was wearing them. I’ll tell him something and in two minutes he won’t remember what I asked. I know depression causes similar changes and he’s definitely depressed. But I feel this is more. He’s under dr. ordered quarantine because he has a procedure coming up, yet every day he comes & tells me that he’s going to run an errand. He can’t remember that he’s supposed to stay at home. I guess I’d like feedback from those of you who have experience with this journey. Thanks.","I need to do this. The fact that I haven’t thought of doing so is a testament to my advanced years.


 I'm guessing you already know you need to read up on neuropsychic testing and what the tests will tell you."
How do you know if you have Alzheimers?,"I am 57, I watched my mom die of Alzheimers 13 years ago at 85. I have some very scary memory moments, how do you know if those are normal and just being an old dude or if you are showing signs of what is to come with something like Alzheimers? Brian","That is a really nice reply by msOuchie. As she mentioned, it is the common and rountine tasks that seem to slip out minds as we age... ""Did I take my daily low dose asprin....Did I feed the cat etc? I'm almost 62 and both parents have Alzheimers/Dementia that started in their early 80's. I asked my GP about this a couple years ago... He asked me if I had ever driven anywhere and couldn't find my way home... Luckily I said no...so we ended the conversation and he simply told me I'm just getting old.


 Certainly, if something is especially concerning to you, that is reason enough to get these tests done. Whether to rule out Alzheimers/Dementia or to start treatment to delay progression. From my experience, the Neurologist asked me if I suffer from any other conditions/diseases like depression, insomnia, etc which can affect the mind. If I've had any head injuries or was on medications, etc. Most of the practical questions are elementary school age type. He also gave me a basic physical. I required an MRI since I banged my head about 4 years ago which required 7 stitches. Not sure if everyone gets that. I made a list of my medications, conditions and the things that I had experienced that I didn't think a normal person my age should have experienced mentally, as you have mentioned in your case. They do appreciate these lists since it makes the questioning easier for both of you. Thank you for your comment Steve!! :)


 I do have some anxiety issues where my head gets merky swimming around through over full with things. That wasn't happening at the time I don't think but that does happen. But again, I have to wonder if that is a mixture of Alzheimer like issues and anxiety? Brian


 Steve n Dallas You jus made me laugh out loud they say to avoid it you must eat anything with coconut / coconut oil and Olives


 Sixty Minutes has done a couple of shows about a large area somewhere that has a HUGE number of Early Onset Alzheimer's people. They have been using the area for tests since it is such a unique situation... And they've been testing everyone.... The six million dollar question is -> ""Do you really want to know"" since there is nothing that can be done??


 Hi Brian: I'm sorry that your Mom had Alzheimers and that you had to go through the sad and frustrating experiences of Alzheimers/Dementia. Both of my parents had/have Azheimers/Dementia and my Dad died years ago. Not because of it but from complications of severe RA. My Mom is in a Home now with Alzheimers/Dementia and we were visiting with her yesterday. We were happy to see each other but we could see a decline in her mental state. I recently turned 58, so I was concerned about me also because of my parents plight plus I was having symptoms that at least half of middle aged people do experience. I felt mine were more than the norm, so I asked my Dr. to refer me to a Neurologist for testing which he did. I needed to know the answer and get things rolling, if it was the case. People in their late 40's and early 50's have been dxd. with Alzheimers/Dementia. On the other hand, forgetting a person's name, where we put the keys, going into a room and forgetting what we wanted then remembering it shortly after, can be quite normal. Our brains are aging after all. There are things that can cause us memory loss and other symptoms like medications, for example. That's why testing needs to be done by a Specialist. --------------- Diagnosing Alzheimer's: How Alzheimer's is diagnosed To diagnose Alzheimer's dementia, doctors conduct tests to assess memory impairment and other thinking skills, judge functional abilities, and identify behavior changes. They also perform a series of tests to rule out other possible causes of impairment. By Mayo Clinic Staff To diagnose Alzheimer's dementia, doctors evaluate your signs and symptoms and conduct several tests. An accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia is an important first step to ensure you have appropriate treatment, care, family education and plans for the future. Early signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia Early signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia include: Memory impairment, such as difficulty remembering events Difficulty concentrating, planning or problem-solving Problems finishing daily tasks at home or at work Confusion with location or passage of time Having visual or space difficulties, such as not understanding distance in driving, getting lost or misplacing items Language problems, such as word-finding problems or reduced vocabulary in speech or writing Using poor judgment in decisions Withdrawal from work events or social engagements Changes in mood, such as depression or other behavior and personality changes Alzheimer's dementia can affect several aspects of your daily life. When warning signs of Alzheimer's dementia appear, it's important that you get a prompt and accurate diagnosis. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075 Take Care! :)


 The List is a little scary being every one of those things has happened, but during my whole life! Big events, forgetting (10-15 years later) that I got up on stage and sung a song to my wife on our 5th wedding anniversary (we just had our 25th) creeped me out! I guess I need to get to my doctor and have the testing done to be sure. The straw that broke the camels back to get me to post this was a day or so ago when I saw that a guy I was chatting with on facebook lived in a town that sounded familiar very familiar but I didn't know where it was. I looked it up on a map and it made sense but the wrong sense. A little later I asked my wife and she told me where it was and it was a city I had spent a lot of time in as my ex-sister-in-law lived there and I passed through it with those memories popping up every time on a regular basis to visit my older children and grandkids regularly over the years. At least a few times a year passing through this town with fond memories of it. To be staring at a map two days ago not knowing where and what this town was seriously creeped me out. Brian


 I also had one of those creeped me out moments that I mentioned to my GP... I couldn't remember the street number of my house... I knew the name of the street but not the number. The good news that my GP reminded me of was the fact that I knew I could look at some of the mail two feet in front of me and get the number... And he reminded me I had told him I'm a very early morning type of person and that the forgetfulness had happened shortly before bedtime. I've also woken up in the morning and BOOM - ""BLUE"" was the color of my second car...that I couldn't remember from the night before. Don't get me started on names... My best friend has reached the point where he automatically tells me the name of the bartender on Friday night


 On that note, my anxiety issues have brought on a lot of ""physical"" health problems that ended up being nothing. Every few years there is something else that I think is real that ends up being an anxiety issue. Could this be another one? I know this is a question for my doctor, but well we are chatting....:D Brian


 I recently became aware of gene testing in this area! It seems a friend of a friend had 2 parents and an uncle with Early Onset Alzheimer's and when she asked her Dr about it (at the young age of 32), she was sent to have some gene testing done. In her case, she DOES have the gene, and she was told she will definitely have Early Onset Alzheimer's. Y'all heard about that?"
Is my wife listening or zoning out?,"In the evenings, my wife sits on the side of the bed facing away from the TV. Is she listening to the TV or just zoning out?. She does not speak.","In your other post you wrote: ""My wife is approaching end stage early onset Alzheimer's. I am her sole caregiver. She was first diagnosed in October, 2010."" Both of my parents had Alzheimer's. They had next to NO attention span towards the end. Your wife could be both listening and zoning out."
Aunt With Alzheimer's,I've never posted on this board before but I am on several other boards on HW. I talked to my 84 year old aunt today for the first time in about a year. I knew she had alzheimers but did not expect her to be so mixed up. I have cried ever since I got off the phone with her. She kept going back and forth from the past to the present and she was crying because she had not seen me in a long time and was happy to hear my voice. She thought we were both much younger and didn't remember anything about my being ill with CFS so I told her I just had the flu. I really didn't know what to say to keep her from getting upset. I am devastated that she is so out of it and my uncle said this was one of the more positive conversations that shes had recently. She did not want to hang up because she was afraid she'd never hear my voice again. I told my uncle to call me for her when she was up to having another talk. I didn't know it would be like this. I'm so sorry for all the folks and their loved ones that are going through this horrible disease. I had no idea it was so awful. Thank you for letting me vent.,"Thanks for the reply. I tried not to talk about anything negative and to go along with what she was remembering. I don't see her anymore because we don't live in the same state and I'm too ill to travel. She had her 84th birthday on Monday but couldn't remember that when I asked about her bday party so I just let it go. She asked me why I hadn't visited her and I mentioned that I was too ill to travel. This upset her, she didn't recall anything about my illness so I just told her I had the flu. She laughed when I told her I was 77 years old and I realized she thought we were still young. I feel so bad for her.


 It's so sad. I could hear that it bothered her a lot when I talked about our age or our children's ages. I had told her that my oldest daughter, who is 58, had a hip replacement surgery but she said that couldn't be because she was too young to have that done. This was before I realized how she was thinking. I do want to continue to talke to her but I don't really know which subjects to avoid. I guess I'll just take it one conversation at a time.


 Yeppers... It can be pretty ugly. On bad days, my sister and I would joke about ""at least tomorrow he/she won't remember this....or that."" But we do what we can when we can. Never ""argue"" with your aunt or anyone else in this condition. Just say yes or maybe later to stall them etc... No sense getting their blood pressure up if you can avoid it.


 My dad was in the first part of his alzheimer's journey when my older brother turned 60. The math was driving him nuts... How can he have a 60 year old son when he's younger than that"
Wife with end stage early onset Alzheimer's,"Hello, Everyone. I am new to Healing Well. My wife is approaching end stage early onset Alzheimer's. I am her sole caregiver. She was first diagnosed in October, 2010. I also am caregiver for my 18 year old autistic son. I welcome this forum.","Yes. But the company is very unreliable. Some of the aides do not show up. When they do, it is normally a newly hired young person. They cannot fry an egg sunny side up or clean. When the replacement person shows up about 10am, I have already given my wife a shower and breakfast. My wife still can walk and sometimes finger feed herself. I am looking for another home health agency. Thanks for asking.


 Hi zoomd - welcome! Do you have Care Aids come in to take care of your wife so you can have a break?


 I am new to healing well also and actually joined due to suspecting Lyme disease. I read this topic also as my mother has primary progressive aphasia which affects her speech and she is now non verbal and has affected her memory and has severe dementia. She is in a memory care unit. I also have a 3 year old son with autism who is getting extensive therapy. So I know how difficult and stressful this must be."
Alzheimers Patients and the Adjustment to Assisted Living,"My siblings and I just placed our mother, age 87, into the best assisted living facility we could find. She appears to be in Stage 5-6 and has deteriorated rapidly over the winter months. While living at home, she seldom dressed without coaxing. She lost all interest in her appearance, her house, and the things she love. She was lost in the past, only finding pleasure in looking at old photo albums. She is in a good deal of pain from degenerative disk diseases, and found only moderate relief from cortisone shots and medication. I would greatly appreciate any input on adjustment to assisted living. She is having a very hard time, and while it has only been four days, I am a bit concerned. She calls me, demands to be taken home, says she will sue us, hangs up on me. The ALF told my sister and I (our brothers live elsewhere) that it's best if we give her time to adjust. I'm sure much of this is not unusual. But I'd like to hear your experiences. Thanks. It's been a tough 12 months for me, caring for my mother while my husband had prostate cancer and surgery for an aortic aneurysm. I'm not complaining, but I know I've got to manage my stress better. Thank you.","Hi Mimi, sorry to hear about your mom, it is very hard to make the decision to do that. I had my aunt with us and after 1 1/2 yrs had to move her to a ALF with a Alz unit. She didn't like it but I went every couple days and took her to run errands with me and to lunch. We hung photos on her walls so it was more homey. The one thing I recommend to anyone with Alz family members is to go to the local Alz meetings as often as you can. They will help you with coping skills, teach you things to do and not do to make dealing with them easier. What I did stop doing was bringing my aunt back to my house cuz she wanted to stay 'home' and would get very mad when I wanted to take her back. So we stuck to neutral places and after a few weeks it was pretty much okay. Learn to change the subject quick, when my aunt would get on something that was not good, I would say something like 'did you see that dog?' .... she loved animals and I knew it would get her attention even if there was no dog but she would forget what she was rambling about and I could take the conversation somewhere else. Every day will bring a new challenge but hang in there you are not alone... I was always amazed at the people that would come by can speak to my aunt and commend me on taking care of her. look for the special moments and cherish them... it will make the bumps not so bad.. have a beautiful day


 Dear Mimi, I cannot begin to stress enough how important it is that you take care of YOU first. You have had SO much on your plate and I realize you are not complaining but the fact is you have had a lot of stress in your life and we all know what stress can do. With that said... my mom has Alzheimer's, was diagnosed over 8 years ago and lived with me the first year. I became very ill and could no longer do it and so she moved in with my sister for 3-1/2 years and now is in ALF for two years. She is at about the same stage as your mom, maybe a little further along. I have two sisters, one is an RN that works at the facility. What I can tell you about AD is that some of what you mention about your mother is the disease...most patients do withdraw. The disease makes them very insecure. All the confusion and memory loss is scary and can cause severe depression, also anger for all they have lost. Looking at photos is a very common interest in AD patients. For them, memories of the past are usually still with them and so it is a piece of their lives that they still have. Try to find as many photo albums as you can and when you visit, sit and look at them with your mom. They will probably bring her comfort. I am so very fortunate. The transition into ALF for my mom was unbelievably great, but my sister does work there and I think that made it so easy, mom knowing that one of her daughters was there. We also visit quite often, my other sister and I, one of us is there every single day and sometimes two of us are there together. If you have other questions, please feel free to post. I wish you well Miriam (I too am ""Mimi"" )


 Glad I've joined this forum as reading everyone's posts helps me. My mom has vascular dementia -- a bit different than ALZheimer's since she doesn't go back into the past. What she has though is a LOT of anxiety and fear. I had her in her condo for the last year with 24/7 companions because of her fear but it was breaking her bank account. It couldn't go on even thought she liked having someone with her 24/7. I found a very nice, upscale luxury assisted living facility. She has a beautiful one bedroom apartment and can wander the halls walk up and down and go to the lobby and activities. IT's been three days and she's miserable. I live 15 miles away and am working so have not been running up there and she wants me to stay overnight, which is exhausting. When I go there she doesn't want me to leave, so to Pop in is difficult because she cries when I go. I am going on vacation next week for my birthday because the last year has been very difficult for me -- managing her finances and mine. I am single and wonder if I should've just figured out a way to take her in, but I knew inevitably with her dementia I'd have to move her anyway. This ALF told me that it's better to get them in while they can bond in the community before they move to another stage of their mental state. I feel guilty all the time like I should be ""rescuing her"" or I should've taken her in. Or OR Or. I always thought I would take care of my mother in the last days of her life, not have strangers takign care of her, but I realized I'd have to ENTIRELY give up my work and my life to do it. I fear I am going to have regrets when she passes away.


 Don't have regrets, I lost my career taking care of my mom off and on for 10 years and my DD with Williams syndrome, she is 44. I am totally burned out and we moved back home for me to help with my MIL who has dementia/alzheimers. I couldn't do it anymore, plus her sister lived behind her with the same problems. I ended up in the ER this year with anxiety/stress attacks so finally convinced my husband to do something with his mom. I was to the point either help me or I'm going to have to leave, I mean I have 100% burnout. She is in a beautiful assisted living center, somehow the sisters who were close got into it so they are in 2 different local facilities. MIL is giving me grief, calling and telling me its my fault she is in there and hallucinating about things too. If we can keep her eating she does better but that's a problem. I go there often as I can but its difficult for me, I try to be nice to her. She was never there for me and I have some resentment that I try to keep pushed down but its there. I finally got our DD in a group home, we would not have done it till age 80 but her behavior got worse and worse. I was dealing with all this as hubby worked overseas 8 weeks and home 3, we did this for 15 years. She is so mad at me, of course you can't reason with her, but I told her I just can't take care of her anymore. Now I had a mammogram and I'm going to have to go for a followup, they found changes. This year has just been to much. So don't get yourself in the state or mess I'm in. You can only do so much before you have to get help and don't feel guilty at all. I am almost 70 so no young chicken either. My husband is finally retiring and will be home the 20th of the month, I'm counting the days. He saw how his mom was the last time he was home, he can start dealing with her instead of me. She blames me for everything and doesn't understand why ""I'm"" making her stay there. I won't let him take her home. I think at the state she is in now that home wouldn't work either, she still thinks her sister is there and has been told time after time she isn't. It's a very sad disease for sure. I wonder how long before she has to go to a more secure facility.


 Assisted Living means the staff ""assists"" her. The ones I've seen keep the doors unlocked so the residents can come and go as they please. My dad lasted a week in his assisted living place. Took him to a Memory care places aka Full Lockdown so that all involved (except him) could get some peace of mind about him not getting out.


 It's rough when having to make that transition from home to an ALF. You just never know how they are going to react. My Gma did fairly well but in the beginning she did not want to be there - not that I blame her. I just made it a point to visit her every day, sometimes a couple of times a day. I would take her out to lunch or shopping. She was not as far gone as your mother tho so I'm sure that made it a little easier. Taking care of someone with AZ can cause a lot of stress especially when the caretaker is dealing with things themselves. I had a lot of health issues while trying to care for my Gma not to mention a wayward teen demanding my attention as well. Talk about stress! My suggestion is give her some time. It's a rough transition for everyone involved. Try to get out there to see her as much as possible and do things with her that she enjoys, even if it's looking at old photos. Hang in there and please let us know how things go okay?


 Thank you, Sherry and Tryin2cope2 for those really good tips. We have learned in the past two days that my mother shows one face to us, her daughters, and another to the staff at the ALF. They believe she is doing fine, and seems to spend a fair amount of time talking to other residents. The father of one of my close high school friends and the mother of one of my former co-workers are there, and since she shares a fairly uncommon first name with the other, they have become meal partners. When my mother sees us, she gets angry and weepy. This leads me to think there is some wisdom in the ALF director's advice to give her some time to adjust. Since it appears my husband's prostate cancer was caught in time, and his Triple A surgery is now behind us, I am hoping I can start to relax a little and take care of me. Mimi in Wisconsin


 Oh, thank you Miriam, AKA Mimi, I do appreciate your kind and thoughtful post. Taking care of me has been the hardest part. I have a very demanding job that keeps me occupied so I am rarely depressed, but it does mean less alone time. Mimi in Wisconsin


 Don't have regrets, I lost my career taking care of my mom off and on for 10 years and my DD with Williams syndrome, she is 44. I am totally burned out and we moved back home for me to help with my MIL who has dementia/alzheimers. I couldn't do it anymore, plus her sister lived behind her with the same problems. I ended up in the ER this year with anxiety/stress attacks so finally convinced my husband to do something with his mom. I was to the point either help me or I'm going to have to leave, I mean I have 100% burnout. She is in a beautiful assisted living center, somehow the sisters who were close got into it so they are in 2 different local facilities. MIL is giving me grief, calling and telling me its my fault she is in there and hallucinating about things too. If we can keep her eating she does better but that's a problem. I go there often as I can but its difficult for me, I try to be nice to her. She was never there for me and I have some resentment that I try to keep pushed down but its there. I finally got our DD in a group home, we would not have done it till age 80 but her behavior got worse and worse. I was dealing with all this as hubby worked overseas 8 weeks and home 3, we did this for 15 years. She is so mad at me, of course you can't reason with her, but I told her I just can't take care of her anymore. Now I had a mammogram and I'm going to have to go for a followup, they found changes. This year has just been to much. So don't get yourself in the state or mess I'm in. You can only do so much before you have to get help and don't feel guilty at all. I am almost 70 so no young chicken either. My husband is finally retiring and will be home the 20th of the month, I'm counting the days. He saw how his mom was the last time he was home, he can start dealing with her instead of me. She blames me for everything and doesn't understand why ""I'm"" making her stay there. I won't let him take her home. I think at the state she is in now that home wouldn't work either, she still thinks her sister is there and has been told time after time she isn't. It's a very sad disease for sure. I wonder how long before she has to go to a more secure facility.


 I just joined this forum. I am in a very similar situation as Celebchat. Just moved mom from her home of 60 years into nice assisted living place three weeks ago. It's about 10 miles from me. Mom has mild to moderate dementia. She keeps packing her stuff and wants to leave. Hates it there. I talked to interim director about how it seems they need a transition person on staff to help people adjust. Had long ""health care plan"" meeting with eight! staff people. They basically were saying because they are concerned about mom ""escaping"" and her safety, they think she should move into memory care. I kept my cool but was livid. It's ASSISTED LIVING not independent. I have 4 siblings but I am doing 90%. I am single and work full time. I'm so worried about my mom and am so stressed out. I feel so bad for her and I feel so helpless. It's killing me. I had caregivers coming to her house but she kept firing them. She was burning things in microwave, trying to walk to places, and she can hardly walk."
Mom with dementia,I go and see my mom every night at the nursing home In the past 3 or 4 days she has been screaming and crying when I leave She has severe dementia How should I handle this and should I keep going and see her every night? My heart is broke Thank you,"What stage is she?


 It's pretty tough being the caregiver. But you also have to take care of yourself too. Try taking a night off and see how it goes. On a humorous note, my sister and I used to have to remind ourselves that ""she won't remember"" if we visited or not.


 Could it possibly be sundowners syndrome??? I know my Mom had issues at night ...like clockwork."
Top neurologist in Boston area,"My father has been losing his memory for the past 6 months. It has steadily been getting worse. Today he can't remember anything. Things he told me 5 minutes ago, he doesn't remember. I want to get him to a top neurologist in the Boston area to get evaluated. He has been to a local neurologist and had an MRI but it did not show anything unusual. This neurologist was not particularly helpful. Does anyone know of a really good neurologist in the Boston area that you might be able to recommend? I think he needs to be looked at ASAP because his memory is really getting bad. It's actually getting a little scary. Thanks for your help!","Yes, we had done that. He provided two names of two neuro doctors. He has seen them. They have not been helpful. They want him to perform a 2 hour long verbal test and charge him 2 thousand dollars, and they said once they get the results there's not much they can really do with the information. I think the reality is that these doctors have no way to reverse the causes of alzheimers, so there's not much they can really do. He has been getting really bad over the past couple weeks. He can't remember anything. I am also concerned about asset protection. If he had to go to a nursing home, they will take all of his money. If they take all of his money, my mother won't have money to live on. Is there a way to protect his money so my mother doesn't go broke? She is 75 and there's no way she would be able to get another job. She would still need to pay the rent, heat, water, ect.


 Do you have a trusted family GP you can go to soon? He/she can look him over and or recommend a Neuro.


 Nursing homes/full lock down facility charge a monthly fee. If you can afford the fee with insurance etc then his assets should be safe to an extent. And or you start moving all his assets to your name etc."
Long term care for father with Alzheimer's,"New here, and looking for some opinions, and possible direction. My father who is now 80 is dealing with Alzheimers, he is in perfect health otherwise. He lives in North Eastern WI., and still thinks he is independent enough to tool around the back roads. Anyone familiar with the weather extremes up north know that this is not a good thing. Getting lost, confused, and pulling over to walk can be very dangerous, especially in the winter. His wife is doing the best she can, but it is becoming apparent that long term facility care will be required in the next year or so. I live far from them, and I hate myself for not being there to help with his care. All I can hope to do is make sure he is in a safe place when his wife can no longer provide him with the care he will require. I am specifically looking for long term care insurance that will allow him to be in a safe space as he progresses. I am by no means wealthy, nor is his wife. Together we are hoping to pool our resources, and be proactive with his long term needs. He is a veteran, and has the usual health insurance through medicare, and supplements.","Some illnesses or pre-existing conditions may disqualify you from the long-term care policy..... You generally have to get the insurance BEFORE you need it. But since he is a Vet, he's eligible for a lot of things. Find an agent or consultant that specializes in Vet care.


 Hi Michael. I’m so sorry you are going through this! Are you an only child? My dad just passed in December 2017 and I was his primary care giver. He was in a wonderful facility when he passed. He lived with me, my husband and two sons for 17 years before he started exhibiting signs of dementia. We knew we could not keep eyes on him 24/7. He was falling at night trying to get to the bathroom 3 feet away. We even kept a commode by his bed. I had already taken his license and car away. 😔 Suggestions: 1) Get in touch with The Cameron Group. They will help you get your dads veterans benefits. It takes a Good 6-9 months but starting the process now will help you and your mom in the long run. It is pricey $900 to use them. But trust me, this is not something you want to take on your self. 2) Look into what the best care homes that are near your mom. She will be visiting him every day. Your saying he doesn’t need to go into a home now. Most care homes, assisted livings, if they are really good, have A 6-8 month waiting period. 3) You May want to look into the state health insurance if dad doesn’t have it already. If he doesn’t, you may Want to look into that paperwork and someone to help you. My husband and I are college educated and my husband is in the finance field. All of this paperwork took Many hours and once you send it to them they constantly send you letters wanting more. Last, this is a tough one, 😞, I would look into prepaying for funeral expenses soon. The limit in Ma. Was $15,000. Check what your limit is in your state. Money goes real fast once more care is involved. I hope this helps. This is something I wished I knew a little earlier. Wishing you the best!


 I happened to see your post here in the forum & wanted to let you know this is a real slow forum. I am not sure if you will get a reply. However, I did a google search for Wisconsin Long Term Care insurance & had a lot of companies to pop up. Insurance varies so much from state to state on cost & coverage. I think you are going to have to make some calls to see if there will something affordable for your dad. I hope you can come up with something. Take care.


 Contact the Alzheimer Helpline at 1-800-272-3900. They operate 24/7 and will provide you with any assistance you need. There's no charge for this service. I completely agree with Steve in Dallas regarding Long Term Care. You need to have this Insurance long before you need it. You father at this stage wouldn't qualify."
Advice for spouse with Alzheimer’s and dental problems,My wife has alzheimers. 7th year. she needs to have several teeth extracted and a temprary bridge put in. Any advice,"Hi JoelG I'm glad you posted. One thing to do is talk to the dentist ahead of time and let him know what and your wife are dealing with. He can sedate her if you think it's necessary or give you something calming. But if he knows what going on he's more likely to get the outcome you're looking for. Warmly, Chutz


 Hello JoelG, I happened to see your post about your wife needing dental care & I wanted to respond. If you will look on this first page there is a post titled “dental care”. Several members has posted there offering tips & suggestions. Perhaps you can click it & find some good ideas there. I hope this helps you a little. Take care."
Aunt who may have Dementia,"Hello everyone, i just wanted to introduce myself. I live in the UK and only recently started to think my loving Aunt may have dementia. Its a difficult situation though. She is 87 and an absolutly lovely person. I think she may have dementia because she now seems forgetful. She repeats herself quite a lot. She tells the same story over and over like it is new information. She forgets dates, and doesn't know what im doing on a particular day and will re-ask even if i have told her. Ive recently noticed she has stopped bathing. The big problem is she wont use any type of doctor, or even get any type of medical advice. When she doesn’t remember something she goes into denial. Says things such as ‘yea i was going to ask about that’ even though it is obvious she has forgotten. I cant get her to a doctor this is impossible. The whole family has tried, her friends have tried. Ive gone to my GP and he said the only thing i can do is get social services to asses her, but she has to be willing, and she is not. Im worried about her and worried about me as im not a carer and i dont know the right things to do or say if she does have dementia. The problem is i dont know so i will most likely say the wrong things. Im also worried that she will get angry at me if she is being forgetful. She also has a lot of vision problems and wont see anyone about that either. Anyway thanks for reading any advice will be helpful.","Hello Ruby! Welcome to HW! Some of these seniors, I'm telling you. Not very helpful. Sorry about your Aunt's state but I'm glad that you check in on her. She doesn't have any Doctors at that age? That's amazing!! Yes, I've heard those symptoms before with my Mom and Dad and many others. The only way you will know for sure if she has Dementia/Alzheimers is for her to be tested by a Neurologist. A visiting Nurse whom my Mom liked, let her into her home once in a while. Through time she started asking her questions that would be asked on a test that would be given by a Neurologist. She later gave me a call(Mom had given her my name and # in case of emergency). The results were bleak. I was sad. I had caught her in instances that reminded me of Dad's symptoms. The Nurse asked if it was okay if she sent a Psychologist assistant to Mom's place to test her. She is qualified for this situation. I gave her my permission. Trouble is when the Nurse asked Mom about the other ""Lady' coming over to ask her a few questions, ""mom said No"". She's not stupid! Maybe you would have better luck in this type of situation. Or you could be there when she went over. I live 3 hours away from my Mom and my Hubby works. My Mom has been in a Home for the past 2 1/2 years. We are told just to agree with what she says and to ask her about her younger years. Maybe that will cheer her up. Unfortunately, my Mom only remembers working hard on the farm and not much else about good times. She was always a negative person even though she had lots of fun times in her life. Oh well! I must be getting into Dementia also. I forgot to log out last night. Sorry, I couldn't help more. Good luck! Hopefully, someone else has ideas."
Driving a car with Alzheimer’s,"My neighbor has Alzheimer’s but still drives his car. This last year he wrecked the tires on his SUV by driving around a rocky vacant lot which he owned. His explanation is that he was trying to cut down the weeds. Another time he stopped his car in the middle of the road, and seemed rather sheepish when asked what he was doing. He drove on home. I was about to report him to the Dept of Motor Vehicles (DMV) as an unsafe driver when I learned that he just got his driver’s license renewed. Anyway, I don’t feel safe with someone that impacted by dementia driving around our neighborhood. His wife and son, with whom he lives, haven’t taken away the car keys. There doesn’t seem to be any protocol for determining when someone with dementia should have their license revoked. A couple of years ago one of our neighbors with Alzheimer’s drove away, and weeks later his car was found abandoned in the desert. The body has not been located. So what’s your thoughts? What should I do?","There is a bunch of stuff about this on the internet.. EXAMPLE: California’s Health & Safety Code [Section 103900] requires physicians to submit a confidential report to the county health department when an individual is diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, including dementia, severe enough to impair a person's ability to operate a motor vehicle. /www.caregiver.org/dementia-driving-and-california-state-law


 Well, it sounds like his family is oblivious to this situation. My thoughts are this, write down his license plate & go see your local police department. I would discuss your concerns with them. At very least they have been alert ed. It sounds like he does not belong behind the wheel & he poses a threat to others including himself. Since he has lost his license once before this may get some attention with the police, I really don't know."
Alzheimers versus Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH),"Hello, My 81 Year old father had a shunt implanted in his brain to drain cerebral fluid from his ventricles to his abdomen. This was done because he was initially diagnosed with NPH as he had the triad of symptoms (Shuffling feet while walking - He uses a walker, Urinary Incontinence, and dementia). This procedures was done 1 1/2 years ago and while he had a little bit of improvement after the shunt was installed he still has dementia and it appears to be getting worse. We went to a neurologist who has now diagnosed him with Alzheimer's disease based on a recent EEG and his inability to answer a series of questions that test his cognitive abilities. I asked the neurologist about having a PET scan to check Amyloid Plaque levels and Tau Tangles as these appear to be definite indicators of Alzheimer's disease from what I have read. The neurologist stated that these PET scans are very expensive and that the results of these scans would not change the treatment plan which is to put my father on medicine in an attempt to slow the progression of the Alzheimer's disease. I am not so sure of Alzheimer's being the correct diagnosis without having the PET scans done. Are there any definitive tests that can be performed that will absolutely diagnose Alzheimer's? Just want to be sure we are getting the correct diagnosis. Any advice/comments would be greatly appreciated.","Perhaps contact Hydrocephalus Associattion: Info@hydroassoc.org or www.hydroassoc.org/cause-view/call-us/ Having both NPH and Alzheimer's is possible but also check if the shunt is malfunctioning or can be optimized.

Afraid I have early onset dementia,"Hello, I am new to this forum. First, I am amazed by the courage you all have! Second I wish to lean on you for support and guidance. My story. Back in 2003 I had classic lyme symptoms that went undiagnosed for a year. My symptoms included. Fatigue (heavy legs). Buzzing in my feet Heart palpattions Anxiety Light senstivty Brain fog Organ pain all over the abodomen. Seeing flashes of light and feeling of electricity passin through my body. Muscle twitching. I did the whole DR. thing and came up with no answes but elvated mono titers. I was 23 years old. I must make a note that when I was 18 I tested flase positive for syphilis at a blood drive at school. Long story short multiple Drs. Later I went to a Lyme dr. Igenex positive test result. I have hunted and fished all over the Midwest so lyme was suspected. After a year under his care I did get some relief. Herbals and abx. I did however experiances some memory and thinking issues after. I went on to run a marathon and live life. 11 years later met the girl of my dreams want to propose this Christmas. In 2016 felt tired all the time in the morning. Drinking large amounts of coeffee and not lived a totally healthy lifestyle. I was able to work out, work, and return to college. It wasn’t until January of last year that I noticed changes. We were going into the process of buying a home. I was working two jobs and school on top of it. Lots of stress in my life. On the day we got a call from the realtor saying offer accepted I had a panic attack by my own doing. That’s when all hell broke loose. The following day I had tight muscles in my neck and I noticed ringing in my head with mild pressure in the back of my head. I began my day thinking nothing of it until I literally felt something release from my brain down my spine and into my legs. After that I have had massive amounts of muscle twitching, neuropathy in extremities. Dementia like symptoms memory, thinking, light sensitivity, burning across my scalp. Panic attacks out of nowhere. These panic attacks were nothing I have ever experienced. It was like my nerves were so inflamed that my nerves were trying to jump out of my body. And three months later I had severed on set of OCD/impulsive thinking, mood swings, depression, crying. loss of drive Etc. The only thing the dr. came up with is you are overweight, bp is elevated and your Free Test is just under normal range. ""Not a concern it’s just anxiety and stress causing all of this"". Finally convinced him to see a nuero and had an MRI came back normal except mild cerebral sulci promance for age. He assured me I was fine and it was just stress. I also had a period when I ate anything with a carb my body felt like it was on fire. Today, 8 months later I have better days than bad. The only thing that creeps me out still is that I have the hissing in my head. Once a month I get a week of ocd and my thinking is about 80% better. I am afraid that the ocd and impulsive thinking, slight paranoia. Always a mellow person before this. This is not as bad anymore but still comes. Dr.s want me to use a anti depressants. My questions are I am afraid I have early onset dementia or other nuero degenerative dieses im only 34 years old. Could this be a virus attacking my brain? Is this Lyme? I had just below standard range of Vit D as well 31.5 taking 10,000 iu 3x a week. I have been taking pau d arco, cats claw, and olive leaf powder. I do say it has been helping. All my symptoms seem nuero and my energy is fine. Just want my brain back. If it is a reactivation of Lyme I don’t have $ for a llmd. I do have good insurance though. Does anyone know of a good dr. that takes insurance in se Wi?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D5aA_-3Ip8
Emotional Outbursts and Alzheimer's,"My mother is 90 and has had Alzheimer's type dementia diagnosed about 2 years ago. Physically she is more like 70...she cleans, cooks, walks fine, dresses, etc. But mentally she is at the moderate severity and is on Aricept 10mg and Namenda 28mg. My main question is about her emotional status, and if what is happening is typical for Alzheimer's. She has always been overly nice all her life, and everything she experienced was ""nice"" and ""fine"". Now, however, she goes from sweet to absolutely belligerent and snarling in a second. As soon as I say anything she doesn't like, which is often, out comes the cornered cougar....has anyone else seen this with their loved one with Alzheimer's? This last time I was sure she was going to hit me. I have another question but will put it in a new post as it is another topic. Thanks....","I m mildly with dementia and start stage alzeimer disease as I can see signs of it. Same here....very angry I get but I have anxiety so I connected to it.


 Yes, this can be a symptom of Alzheimer's. Have you talked to her doctor about possibly changing her medication or increasing her Namenda?"
New Journey on Dementia,"Hi, there! New to this recent life experience... My 69 years old mom just had a stroke causing her to experience dementia. The doctor's diagnosis was a stroke causing her to experience dementia. CT scan result shows chronic infarct, right basal ganglia with focal encephalomalacia. Prior to this diagnosis, my wife and I observed these things. She was listless and very silent which is not her personality. She forgot some things, like her birthday, her age and there was a delay when speaking. She can’t identify some things, she thought of the spoon as a toothbrush. Took a medicine but swallow it directly without opening the foil but glad I was able to notice and grab it immediately from her. She can’t grab the spoon and even asked what she will do with the spoon. She cries a lot.

Dental care for mother with dementia,"That's tricky.....does you mom do well with mild anesthesia? If so, perhaps they can knock her out and use crowns instead of implants? Dentures are usually not a good option for people with AD/dementia because they will keep pulling them out. When I had to take my gma, they put her on valium but after she got bad (mentally) I couldn't take her anymore.","Yes, my gma went without dental care but luckily her teeth weren't bad. But you are correct, bad teeth need to be fixed or come out.


 Thanks a lot. Dentists think all Alzheimer patients are violent and will hit them so for insurance liability reasons they say no.


 Luckily I can't tell you because my mom has never been like this. I've seen movies of people getting pretty violent though. It's scary.


 In the past 2 days my mom has had 2 teeth broken off. She has so many spaces in her mouth that it cannot be ignored anymore. Has anyone had dental implants done on a PD or dementia patient. Is it dangerous to do with the condition?


 I actually found a place that specializes in Autistic children and PD/Alzheimer's patients. Hopefully they know what to do. I have a consult in 2 weeks. Teeth is so important. Sounds lame but it's true.


 If they can do implants for her then I'm sure it will cost an arm and a leg and then some but.... I'll work 3 jobs if I have to pay it off.


 What they will do is a payment plan. Most places are like that now. They still need to make $.


 Thanks. I'm actually kinda confused with this process. I have to get the approval from her family doctor to get the anesthesia done. We have an appointment at the dentist next week to see what can be done. I don't know how they will be able to get an x-ray of my mom's mouth to see if her bones are strong enough to get the implants. She will not cooperate at all and when she is sedated I want it to be a one shot deal and not do it repeatedly for different steps. I have major phobia whenever I feed her. I'm terrified that more teeth will break off.


 Thank you Betsey. You are very informed about this. The visit with the Dentist early this week was a bust. She said my mom would need too much work done and that implants may not be suitable because my mom's teeth are crooked and they overlap the missing tooth area and so the implant may not fit. It would be at least 6 visits to get all the work done at that office so she suggested I take my mom to a teaching university dental office. The should have all the equipments and be able to deal with my mom better. We have not scheduled a visit yet. The digital and pan x-rays sound very cool. Hopefully that will work on my mom when the time comes. I am just worried about how much pain she will be under if and when she does get implants. Maybe I should leave well enough alone and let her eat soft food forever and not risk this? But then more teeth will eventually fall out. Then what?


 Anilas? I'm sorry but there is no replies from you unless the emails are misdirected. Last Friday we saw an Oral Surgeon. He was very patient and took digital x-rays. It took about 10 and they all had to go inside her mouth and it was very hard on my mom. She has 6 roots that needs to come out and will have to be sedated. I am so worried about the pain and after math of the sedation. Being how my mom seemed to him last week he thought implants was a waste of $ because my mom was non responsive to him and so he assumed she is like this always. Basically a vegetable. She's only like this with strangers. I told him she still needs to eat and pureed food will just send her closer to the grave because as it is she is losing weight rapidly. My poor mom. I feel so helpless. It's 2013 and it feels like nothing much has advanced in dental care since the 80's. Everything is still painful and takes long time. Shame on modern medicine.


 Thanks it looks interesting but.... what is it? I can always give my mom plain ice-cream but I just want her to be able to eat real food like meat. Things with substance. I know for myself I can't get full unless I eat bulky foods. Things that satisfies the tummy and not just add calories in liquid form. When I was younger I ate Little Debbie peanut butter wafers and gained 10 pounds in no time. Those were the good old days.


 My mother has many cavities and her teeth are falling off in bits and pieces and her bridge is also in bad shape. I don't know what to do. Her regular dentist wouldn't work on her since last year because they feel her dementia is getting worse and they don't want the liability of her biting them even though I know she won't. The problem she has is she just won't open her mouth. They suggested a dental school who have all the equipments but they work in stages and by the time they will actually work on her will probably be 6 months from now. She had 2 teeth extracted last year by an oral surgeon who was very nice but he doesn't do cleaning. I don't know if he's willing to pull more teeth from her since it's now a year later and my mom is a little worse off than before. So first thing first. Does people with dementia just don't get their teeth cleaned or fixed? My poor mom has that look you see of women in their 90's with no teeth because she has quite a few missing in the front area. Implants are out because they are very complicated and also take too long and painful I heard.


 I'm reluctant to put her under fearing the anesthesia will worsen her dementia. Yes if she got dentures she will certainly pull them out. The problem is she won't keep her mouth open too long and will start to cause problems by not holding still if she's there too long. 3 years ago I was taking her to her dentist every Saturday for a full month at 3 hours each to get all her filings done but even that she still has new cavities and at this stage she won't sit still like before. So your GMA just went without dental care? I was told bad teeth needs to be pulled out fearing infections. I rather do it myself if I could. Just kidding.


 I worked in long term care for a number of years and I remember the difficulty finding dentists willing to work with people who had dementia. It is sad, but understandable. They are difficult to work with when following instructions and describing their symptoms is so integral to the work being done. Here is a link about dental care for people with Alzheimers: http://alzheimers.org.uk/site/script s/documents_info.php?documentid=138 If the above link isn't working for you, try this one: http://tinyurl.com/7jpkq5w It may help you. If you're not in the UK, ignore the part about finding an NHA dentist, but you can contact your local Alzheimer's association for a list of dentists more likely to work with your mom. You may even find the information online, but if not, telephone them as they are extremely helpful. (eta: Not sure why the first link isn't working. Some of the time it does and some of the time it doesn't. If you get the page not found response at the Alzheimer's Society page, use the 'search our site' box and type in or copy & paste: Dental care and dementia & it will take you to a page listing the article, then click on that article and it brings you to the link I posted above.

 But are some Alzheimer patients really that violent? And is it due to confusion or anger issues from the brain?


 My mom is unpredictable. Sometimes she knows how to brush once I start it for her and other times she takes it and brushes the sink with it. I try and make sure it's clean daily. Her teeth are falling out so there isn't much left and all dentists we've seen say just let her be and forget about trying to replace them. I notice a lot of doctors just like to give up because the patients are old and they think it's a waste of time and $.


 It's not dangerous per se, but in order to to do implants on a dementia patient, it requires sedation - in most cases and they normally don't respond well to sedation (causes more confusion as they're coming out of it). But you should find a dentist in your area that specializes in geriatric care or dementia patients; her doctor might be able to help you find one.


 Not lame at all! Teeth ARE important....sure food can be mushed up but it's not the same. I'm glad you found someplace to take her. Let us know how it goes okay?


 She doesn't have dental insurance or money of her own? If not, tell the dentist this and they might be able to get you a discounted rate.


 They could extract all upper teeth and then place 4 implants on the upper arch....one on each posterior area and 2 more wear the cuspids were. Then a full upper denture would be made to fit over those implants and that denture should fit real tight and she wouldnt be able to take it out. The placements of the implants she would need to very still or lightly sedated. Implants need to knit in the bone for a few months and then a implant metal thingy screw on top of each framework that is in the tissue. Then impressions for a full upper denture.3 weeks later the denture is finished. Betsey


 She could get a panorex xray done of her entire mouth. It rotates around her head. That way they can see how thick her bones are and how low her sinuses are. If individual xrays need done they could do digital xrays. Here and there . Put a wand in her mouth and it show up on a monitor. Neat how thing have improved over the years. Let us know what he recommends from the consultation. Betsey


 The pan x-ray didn't happen. My mom is not capable of standing alone and holding on to the 2 handle bars AND bit down on this contraption. We were referred to a teaching hospital yet again but the waiting period is after the summer so I looked up an oral surgeon that extracted 2 teeth for my mom 2 years ago. His office said they have an pan x-ray taken of my mom from then but was very blurry. My mom' mental state is way worse now than before so I don't know how this will be taken this time. There are a total of 5 roots that needs to be removed and I don't know if implants will be recommended for her. Sedation will have to be done to remove all the teeth. I just pray it will be done quickly and no lingering damage. Question - what about people in wheelchairs? How do they get Pan x-rays taken?


 Bella; my Mom has a swallowing problem, and was down to 84 lbs. She has been eating something called ""Magic Cup"" and she has gained a lot of weight -- she's up to 109. You can serve it like ice cream or like a custard, but my Mom loves it! Maybe this would help since your Mom has trouble with chewing? Here's the website: http://www.hormelhealthlabs.com/2colTemplate_product.aspx?page=CO_MagicCup&cond_id=117&cat_id=119 Carol


 This is a nutritional supplement. It's like ice cream but has more nutritional value. Maybe you could puree her food and use something like this as a supplement? I know I'd like my Mom to be able to eat more substantional things, but she can't, so I have to think of what her needs are. My brother and I just spoke about this yesterday; he said she is gaining weight, but I wish she'd eat more than pureed food and the magic cup. I said the time has come for her to eat what she really likes, and he agreed. Tough stuff, I know! Take care."
How do you start the placement process?,"I'm afraid we are getting closer to the time that we will have to place my mother in a residential home designed for people with Alzheimer's...she is 90, but physically is like a healthy 70 year old. Completely independent and able to physically do all tasks of daily living, getting around, etc. But mentally, ah, what a challenge. The usual lack of shorter term memory, some delusional confabulation, complete denial that anything is wrong with her, and no ability to reason. Anything that is amiss is someone else's fault. I already set up a weekly med box for her and handle the refills, handle the finances, and we hire a lady from church to take her shopping once a week. My 63 y.o. brother has always lived with her (he is disabled with Asperger's and severe OCD, but thinks clearly) and is supposed to be daily checking on her to take her meds, save the mail for us to see, and be sure to throw out old food. But he doesn't follow through reliably. Anyway, that's the brief picture. Her emotional status is much worse now, she easily becomes instantly belligerent and snarling if I say anything she doesn't like (which is often). She thinks nothing is wrong with her. I don't know where to start when it comes to finding an appropriate facility for her that will take her social security and Medicare for payment. She doesn't have any assets or long term care insurance. We live in Arizona, and I don't know if there are programs for low income Alzheimer's patients. I don't even even know who to ask. I'm the only and last family member to take care of her, and my brother too. I can barely take care of myself, I am disabled. Can someone give me a starting point please? Thanks Trisha","Try the Arizona Division of Aging and Adult Services. They should be able to provide some guidance, if not actual assistance. /www.azdes.gov/daas/ Good luck to you and your mom.

 Thanks for all the info about the VA, I appreciate your detailed reply. Since I posted originally, I found out how to apply for state funded long term care here in AZ. It is a part of the Medicaid (in AZ called AHCCCS) program, and my mom had to qualify financially (low income) and medically. We filled everything out (I have durable power of attorney already) and she did qualify financially. Then a nurse came out to do the medical evaluation, and because she can still do her ADL's (activities of daily living) such as walking, transferring, toileting, feeding herself, dressing etc, she did not qualify, despite the burned food (fire risk, as she still cooks) and her Alzheimer's. I was told to reapply when she is worse, and also after the first of the year, the criteria will be changing to weigh mental issues more heavily. She is definitely getting worse, as last week she crossed a line by hitting me, hard, for the first time because I asked her to look for a receipt in her purse. She gets instantly belligerent, and now violent, with no warning. I wonder what she would have done to me if she had happened to have a knife in her hand (we were in the kitchen) I notified her doctor, who said there was nothing that could be done. As far as the VA, that did come up in the long term care application. Unfortunately, my mom ""has no idea"" where my father's military papers are...nor will she look for them. His DD214 (discharge) etc. He died in 1981, and was buried at a VA cemetery. We tried to file the paperwork, but the VA said we need his papers. I thought they would have records on him, based on his social security number, which I supplied, but no go. I guess at some point, my hubby and I will have to search thru every single thing my mom has to see if she has them somewhere, which will enrage her. For now, I continue to have to handle her affairs, finances, meds, etc, as well as my disabled brother's stuff, who at 64 has always lived with her and has no clue how the world works (he has Aspergers and OCD) and I just found out I have Lyme disease as well as, or instead of fibromyalgia, for 20 years, I'm sicker than them and can't handle this anymore!


 Sorry to hear about your mom... Was your dad a Vet by any chance? I think you'd get some ***istance if he was. Since your mom is so physically fit, she'll need a full lock down facility to help keep her from leaving. You can Google-> Arizona Alzheimer lock down facility to help get your search started.


 Thanks for the ideas! I hadn't even thought of my dad's veteran status....he served in WW2 and died in 1981. I'll follow up on that and the other idea with AZ DES. Thank you!


 We had to get husbands mom a physical and evaluation first, took me a year to get her to do it. Then when he said it was dementia she agreed to go in. By the time she did she swore we tricked her. She signed the papers and everything. You can go to VA, if her assets are less then $80k and her income less then $13k and they will adjust it for the care facility fees they can get up to a max of $1149 a month for help. MIL's SS and VA will almost cover hers. For 6 months they are giving us a reduced rate of $1800, then goes up to $2555. Your dad only had to be in 1 day while the country was at war. Just go see your county Veterans assisted officer, some places will charge you he won't. Then we had to get her a chest xray and TB test, it may vary state to state. She is in a beautiful one and hates it. Also doesn't hurt to have a durable POA. She never would sign one so we can't be in charge of her. But we have the doctors report saying she has dementia. My understand is VA will pay toward assisted living but not a nursing home. And husbands nephew said you can't get both Medicaid and the VA help medicare does not pay for assisted living. Oh VA has no look back right now but I hear its gong to go to a 2 year lookback, in other words did she give money or property away in the last 2 years. For Medicaid its a 5 year look back and has been a long time."
care options after leaving rehab after broken hip,Mom is 86 and has lived in a memory care facility for the past 10 months. She recently fell and broke her hip. She was discharged to a rehab facility and is now about to discharged from rehab. The memory care facility wants us to hire 24/7 aides since they are not able to watch her constantly to insure she uses her walker. How have others dealt with care post-hip surgery rehab? Thanks in advance for your suggestions., 
My mom: Shoplifting and suspected Alzheimer’s,"I hope you are all doing fine and first and foremost, thanks for reading this. This is a very sensitive topic for me. My mom is 75 years old and she was caught shoplifting at a supermarket yesterday. The supermarket manager decided not to press charges. My mom has done this in the past but when we where all at home (we were a family of 9) and during financial distress, when she was around 48 years old. She actually received therapy and improved and stopped shoplifting, as far as we know. Fast forward to yesterday, and this happened again. I believe this was triggered by stress since my oldest brother decided to move back to her house and she doesn't want him there. I feel that she has no need to to do this since we provide for her food and her fridge is full with groceries. We also suspect Alzheimer since she has been insulting her daughters (me included) for no apparent reason, plus forgetting little things here and there. My grandmother also had Alzheimer. We are worried and decided that she needs to see a neurologist (to assess if she has Alzheimer) plus a psychiatrist to start treatment. What else can we do for her? I'm so worried that this may happen again and she may end up arrested or in a very difficult situation. At least she is not living on her own which is a relief even though her current situation is very stressful for her. Thanks for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated!","Have you asked her why she is shoplifting? If she can answer you coherently, it may have to do with an issue that is stressing her out and not be Alzheimer's. The oldest brother may be that issue. It good you're taking the pre-caution of having her see a neurologist, but your post indicates you're making assumptions about her behavior without having talked.to her directly. If you ask her and she can't give you a coherent answer, it's a good thing you have a neurologist also checking her out.


 Hi tupuedes, I'm so sorry you and your family have to go through this. Not long before my father passed away he was showing signs of Alzheimers. He didn't recognize common things like a camera. When he was younger he and a friend used to take wedding pictures to make some extra money so he knew cameras well. I think you are doing the right thing by having her examined and to get a diagnosis. It might be something different but stealing things you don't need isn't normal. But if you get a diagnosis then if she does it again you can present her medical records in her defense. Plus the doctors can begin treatment for whatever it is that's making her act this way. I do hope you can settle this quickly for your peace of mind. It's hard to take care of our parents. Been there, done that. Warmly, Chutz"
Question regarding my brain MRI results,"I had a brain MRI done because I have some lesions on my brain that were noticed 5 years ago on an MRI (done because of some neuro issues). I am 53 years old now. Anyhow, my MRI has been stable with regard to the lesions, however, I just received a copy of my MRI that was done yesterday and I don't understand what it could mean. It says: FINDINGS: Within the supratentorial white matter, there are approximately 20 areas of abnormal T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensity. The most conspicuous of these lesions is in the left frontal operculum. There is relative sparing of the temporal lobes. There is no abnormal enhancement on postcontrast imaging. No new lesions compared to the prior study. No mass effect, hydrocephalus or evidence for hemorrhage. No reduced diffusion within the brain or skull. Normal marrow signal intensity within the skull base, calvarium and facial skeleton. IMPRESSION: Redemonstration of multiple supratentorial areas of nonspecific but abnormal white matter signal abnormality, unchanged compared to the prior study from 12/1/2014. END OF IMPRESSION Can someone tell me this means. Specifically, the ""RELATIVE SPARING OF THE TEMPORAL LOBES""? I am so very afraid that I might have early onset of dementia or Alzheimer's or something. Unfortunately, I don't have a doctor appointment until next week and in the meantime, I'm really scared. Any input would greatly appreciated.", 
Alzheimer’s Mother-in law refuses to eat,"I don't know where to begin.. We found out mother in law had Alzheimers in 2012...we had been wondering for a few years...this past November we had to place her in assisted living as she kept falling down and would sit all day starring...the first month at assisted living she started to perk up and go play bingo with a group in the home....the last month she has been taken to ER 3x as she says her stomach hurts...this last trip she got very mean with everyone, now thinks everyone out to poison her or harm her, so refuses to eat or take her Meds, visiting nurse went to access her...she refused to let her take her BP....she talks non stop or should say babbles...sometimes can understand words...I am concerned as no eating or drinking will she snap out of this or will this be how she stays refusing everything....",If she is having problems with here stomach it could be a side effect of the drugs she is on. Could have something to do with the diet she is on. It would make sense that she think she is being poisoned if her stomach hurts. Probiotics and change of diet might help with the stomach. Some people us coconut oil to treat Alzheimers. Might give that a try.
Place to stay with grandmother with dementia,"Hi everyone. Need some advice please. Would like to stay in a condo or apartment before November in Ontario together with my grandmom who had dementia. I'm looking for a nice place, walking distance to restaurants, hospital and groceries. So it would be easy for me to look after her when buying things. We are the only two left who is living in our family. And I might be looking for a retirement community soon for my grandma. As of now, I am looking for a condo where we can stay. Lots of questions. Any suggestions would be great. Thanks","I consider myself an elder care expert. You would need to give more information. Such as her current living situation, How much time are you spending with her now? Is she mild, moderate or severely demented? Would you be taking her from her area to yours? Why do you think this move is good for her? Does she have friends in the area i.e. her church? She could be more confused if you move her. so your reasoning here must be sound. What type of work do you do? If you say nursing, you maybe able to use those skills or you could have a job that requires heavy travel and i would think maybe not. You stated she might need to go to a retirement housing. If you get her into the senior living environment early it allows for better relationships with staff and other seniors. Follow your first mind... Can you do this? Care-giving is a passion. It's not for everyone and you need to know your limitations. The best option might be to do a trial run and live with her in the place she currently resides... so you can get a real feel for her and the level of care she would need... I would do this before she is moved. I say this because if she has been in the same home for many years she could become severely depressed and confused if you move her. Be sure to look for places near a good adult day care center... and don't be afraid to ask for help. Best of luck to you! Post Edited (f@$kepilepsy) : 10/28/2015 8:31:14 PM (GMT-6)"
Specialists in Chicagoland area,Hi guys. I don't normally hang out on this forum but I need some advice. My dad is displaying some aggression and his personality is starting to change a bit. Both of his moms brothers died of Alzheimer's and his mom (my grandmother) has very advanced Alzheimer's disease. I don't know too much about Alzheimer's but I know that the earlier one begins treatment. The longer they can have without the debilitating symptoms. It is scary to watch my grandmother lose all of her memories and abilities. She doesn't even know her own children. I want my dad to have as long as possible without being crippled by this devastating illnes. Can you recommend specialists in Chicagoland area? What specific tests or procedures were helpful/relevant etc... I know Alzheimer's is difficult to diagnose but having the right care team will make things better. Thanks,"Thanks!! I'm gonna check that out. I'll also ask my pcp for recommendations but sometimes real references from patients are good too I'm sure I'll see you at the other side


 Don't know if you're still checking back here or not, but I was diagnosed in 2006 with alzheimers, and started immediately on Aricept, and two months later on Namenda (memantine). The combination of those two drugs has been an absolute life saver for me....along with the brain exercises I do every day, and the regimen of vitamins that are said to provide healthy brain cells. I have a website with all the information we've found over the last ten years to help make life better for my husband and myself if you want to check it out. www.dodgingdementia.com Good luck you.


 I'm glad you found a doctor for him. And hopefully he will help and be able to find the cause of your fathers ""distress"". I sincerely hope it's not AD but if in the event it is, even tho there is no cure, there are medications to slow the progression.


 How did he do on the cognitive test?


 Welcome to this side of the forum but I'm sorry that your dad seems to be having issues :( This forum doesn't get much traffic but if you are looking for a specialist, go to ratemds.com This is a peer based website that gives reviews on doctors by speciality and location. Actually Alzheimer's is not too difficult to diagnose but unfortunately when the symptoms are strong enough to warrant an evaluation, the disease has progressed. But, yes....early treatment MAY slow down progression. The key is finding the right treatment. Best of luck with your father and if you have anymore questions don't hesitate to ask.


 Thanks Alice! I appreciate it and I'm looking into finding a really good neurologist. I hope I can find someone who is in an academic setting who can supply us with the most current info.


 Thanks! So just a little update, My dad will be seeing John Cheponis at Rush university this week and we will see what he says from there. I hope that I have good news to share very soon. He is most definitely suffering from stress at work and financial stresses etc. however, his behavior is off. Also, I noticed his formerly very good sense of smell has diminished I recall reading at some point that smelling is associated with the area of the brain associated with early stages of dementia


 Doctor ordered some testing to see if it's AD. Mri and crapload of blood. He also did some cognitive testing"
Difficult when our loved ones won’t recognize us,"My father is going through the final stages of Alzheimer's. He is now verbally abusive to me. We have been going through this for six years now. I do not want to go visit him in the nursing home which is an assisted living centre in California. as I know what I will have to deal with. But I go, and some days come home and cry myself to sleep. This is an extremely unfair disease. I don’t know whether he is comfortable over there. Sometimes it's difficult when our loved ones won’t recognize us. Has anyone here been through this? Please share.","I agree, this is not your father talking. He is still in there but his brain won't let him be who he once was. My Gma was never verbally abusive to me nor my son but for some reason she was to my daughter and husband. One day fine, the next nasty. Which was so odd because she was always very loving and giving in the past. It truly is an unfair disease.


 Hi! I'm new here but I just had to say that I'm sorry that you are going through that. That isn't really your Father talking. My Mom isn't in the final stage yet but she did let my Hubby have it a couple months back. We couldn't believe what she said, since they always got along well and she thinks highly of him. Then the next day she was normal again, didn't remember a word she said. Maybe she is in the last stages. There are some close family members that she doesn't recognize. Scary! I guess she'll forget me next. I think I am ready for whatever comes. I hope I am ready. Awful what these darn diseases can do to the body and brain. Just ignore his outbursts, difficult as it is. Hang in there and take care. :)"
The start of Alzheimers or dementia?,"I'm not expecting anyone to diagnose my best friend of 50 years, just looking for some advice. We are both 67 years old. Sue is one of the kindest and most generous persons you could ever know...she would give you the shirt off her back and some people and relatives have taken advantage of that for years. She has always been a very vivacious, intelligent and friendly person but was also always insecure, especially around people she perceived as being ""better"" than her and was always afraid someone would get ""mad"" at her if she did something like try to return an item to the store. Over the past couple of years that insecurity has gotten worse, to the point where if she has to go to an event where one of these ""better"" people might be, she obsesses for days over what she will wear, buys many outfits til she finds the right one and has terrible anxiety until the event is over. A couple of years ago when everyone was buying fancier cell phones she decided to buy one of the androids because I guess she wanted to feel like she was keeping up with everyone else. She has had it two years now and still can't remember how to use it properly. It has actually become another obsession to her...it's all she talks about , asks the same questions about how to use it over and and over, most the time can't figure out how to even answer it. It's all she ever focuses on and it's driving her family and friends crazy. She refuses to give it up even when we suggest something easier. She also gets very confused over other things, forgets things very quickly and easily and has a hard time finding her way around when she, I and our 7 other girlfriends get a cottage each summer...takes her days to get used to where different rooms are etc. If you just met her you might not notice anything because she ""covers' for things by laughing them off and oftentimes she can even hold a very normal conversation, explaining something she did the previous day in great detail. I know this all might sound minor but if you were with her all the time, you would KNOW there was definitely something very wrong. Her family is NOT supportive and oftentimes mock her forgetfulness. We women who have been friends (more like sisters) for these 50 years want to be there for her and wonder what we can do. She knows that her family wants her to be tested for Alzheimers but of course she is very afraid of that at this point....it's not like her mind is totally gone but things ARE slowly starting to deteriorate. Plus she has macular degeneration so her eyesight is getting worse, which doesn't help the phone thing either. She has always driven everywhere and still insists on driving but I don't know how long that will be safe (if it even is now because she can't see signs). I have heard that people with Alzheimers oftentimes start by ""obsessing or focusing"" on a certain thing and that darn phone is definitely it. She sits by the hour just touching things on the screen, not knowing what's going to happen and usually gets completely frustrated when she can't figure them out. She must call me 1-4 times a day, usually to ask me some question about the phone (we're talking TWO years now!) so I know she's sitting at home just playing with it. It's definitely getting on her family's nerves and mine to be honest. I try to tell her to get rid of it and get something simple and she says she will but never does...just laughs it off. What is going on with my dear friend and do you have any suggestions?","Another familiar story...the obsessing over things....mine is the new patio funiture we bought....every single day, he's adding to it, over and over to the point of just forgeting about barbequing the 4th of July. I don't have the stomach for this new care he's gonna need. I've been through a heart attack, cancer, colon removal, with my husband and now that he's turned violent on me, I'm just over this life of care giving. I'm just sooo lost and so furstrated....one minute all is okay and now, I'm married to a guy that has turned violent and made me public enemy number one....27 years with this guy and now, if he could, he could kill me and I'm suppose to blame all this on AZ???


 andwes, it is wonderful that you have kept these friends all these years. I have a few myself. It is obviously that Sue does need some kind of doctor's exam. You cannot help her, so her daughter would be the one to take action. You can tell her daughter this situation upsets you because you love and value her friendship so much. If some of the other ladies have similar feelings about Sue, maybe they can share them? I believe family members are initially in denial. You have mentioned your concerns. All you can do now is be supportive. Maybe ask the daughter if she'd do some research. I highly recommend that the daughter go on the next doctor's visit. I know it's so difficult to fear losing such a valuable friendship. Something is going on; maybe it's another medical problem that can be easily treated. I hope so! Much blessings...


 I worry about myself with the stress I've been under I am forgetting things. I will put something down and can't find it. Also I put away some Christmas presents a couple of weeks ago so DD couldn't find them when she comes home for a visit, for the life of me I can't remember where. I am almost 70 and thinking of getting tested for alzheimers and praying its just from the caregiver burnout I have.


 Sounds like my dad... He went from being OK using a computer to not being able to use it at all. I'd go visit him on a Sunday... We'd spend 30 minutes with me showing him how to compose and send an email...then we'd go to another room and chit chat for an hour... I'd mention it was time for me to go and he'd say he wanted me to help him with something on the computer-> How to send an email This went on for months.... I'd just humor him and do the best I could... He was a big note taker since he forgot so much.. It really got to him when I dug through his notes and showed him all the steps he had written down. He eventually bit the bullet and quit turning the computer on. You might want to try and talk your friend into getting one of those simple phones with the huge numbers so she can call people. You might also want to read through other posts here so you can see you're not alone.


 Betty, I can understand your fears. Can you sleep in separate rooms? One thing I will suggest id to get a notebook and document unusual behavior or dialog. Make sure he can't find it. You may need it at a doctor's visit, especially the violence part. You might also try to find a support group in your area. I wish you the best and hope your husband can get help.


 Andwes, I have learned it is very common and a part of the Alzheimer's for a person to have obsessions and compulsions. This has been one of the most frustrating things for me with my DH who was diagnosed with AD about 8 years ago. Your friend has it with a phone but it could be anything. My DH has it with locking doors. He unlocks and locks all outside doors at our house up to 30-40 times every night. He can't sit down for more than 3 seconds to a few minutes. He not only locks doors, he also jerks on them, checking to see if anyone could pull them open. He insists that he's being cautious and protecting us and our things. This is just one thing....he also removes all his clothes out of his chest or closet and thinks we are in a hotel and are leaving. I must remind him several times a day that this is our home and we live here. This is my first post here and I guess I can't be very positive. I'm tired and not knowing what to do next. Glad I found this place and andwes, I just wanted you to know these activities are quite common. Good luck to you


 postab think of your brain as a balloon. a balloon has only so much room and your lifes events and knowledge that you have accumulated all these 70 years has literally filled that balloon to its capacity. even little things cant find room anymore and are left at the entrance of the balloon. you worry to much. stress will make you crazy and you wont even recall what day it is unless you see it in a newspaper or on tv. it is not important. just recall what you do and go on with your life. if you dont remember, ask someone to remember for you. who cares!! imagine if you give that balloon to your grand kids as a present. Imagine how wise they would be for their age and not make the mistakes all of us make during the blowing up of that balloon. so celebrate your everyday and don't sweat the little things, because at 70, you realize """"who cares"" in 50 years from now. who will even remember you forgot something. focus on what makes you happy, not what you are forgetting. Alzheimers is not forgetting. its having a house key, going over to your caregiver and asking ""'what this i found in my pocket . what does it do?"" . thats Alzheimers"

 Could be, some years ago a research report on cardiovascular plaques found they were the same substance found in gum disease, we have hope!


 There has now been more progress made in this field of research. Harvard professors Rudolph Tanzi and Robert Moir have discovered that amyloid is an anti-microbial protein in the body, part of the immune system's natural defence against invading microbes. They exposed cultured human nerve cells and lab animals to various infections and found that the amyloid had a protective role. This might explain why decades of research into anti-amyloid thera pies have not worked - the theory that amyloid is the cause of the dementia may be far too simplistic. Recently 33 scientists from around the world published jointly in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease to express their dismay at the lack of recognition for recent breakthroughs in the links between infection and Alzheimer's. Borrelia bacteria coated with beta-amyloid have already been found in Alzheimer hippocampal plaques at autopsy. If it turns out that this is at the root of most LOAD (Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease), that will be wonderful news as it could open the door to effective therapies for millions. This is a very exciting field of research - I truly hope that the funding bodies will catch on and give it the attention it deserves. A reflex disbelief that bacteria could cause peptic ulcers years ago led to millions of people suffering (and often dying) needlessly. Today it is universally understood and accepted that the bacteria Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers and gastric carcinoma, and many many lives have been saved as a result. Elena Elena Cook .


 make me wonder if the root causes isn't the polymicrobial dental infection that's 1 or 2 inches from brain-ie root canal"
Motion detection with monitor,"My 90 yr old mother has lived with us for 4 yrs (since my dad died)....we have tried two different motion cameras, but unfortunately, the wifi connections keep getting lost....my husband wants to get a monitor without wifi, but i'm having difficulty finding one! Samsung used to make one that vibrated (so as not to wake my husband), but no longer. I'd like to view what's going on with her, but i guess i may be stuck with just a motion sensor....would like one that is NOT LOUD though. A foot pad is not advisable as she could fall. Does anyone have any suggestions? thanks","yes, we did buy the uniden.....it serves our purposes....unfortunately, the alarm part, the volume does not go down low enough (i'd prefer a vibrate so that it wouldn't wake my husband )...this one sounds like an elephant trumpeting...it is quick and short, though, but when said parent can get up betw 3-5x a night, it can get a bit annoying. I honestly was hoping samsung still sold their baby monitor that was also motion detection...it was perfect with a vibrating noise (my daughter in law had it and i was there when it worked) i'm sorry if this was not a good enough answer for you. this whole process is so frustrating....i don't see how there cant be a company out there that makes what we need@


 I need suggestions please. My grandfather has dementia and Alzheimer's. Having a bad day. Refuses to take meds what can I do?


 thanks for your reply....i will look into it...


 I need help. My grandfather has Alzheimer's and Dementia. I cannot get him to take his meds today. Having a bad day. What can I do?


 The last week-week and half, my mom has done this as well. I have been smashing them all (mortar and pestle) except one for thyroid....try to get her to take it, she drinks the water, but pill doesn't go down....slowly it disappears or she finally chews it....had to take out the stool softener pill....put them in some warm applesauce or peaches and feed them to her like that...good luck."
How long is this dying process going to take,"My 85 year old mother lived with my family for 5 years. The past year she started having some forgetfulness, but was ok staying home while I worked. This fall on October 19 she complained of a headache. I had a dr. appointment for her on October 23 and the dr. thought she had a sinus infection. By Sunday, October 25 she broke out with shingles on her face. I took her to the emergency room, after diagnosis and pills, I thought things would get better. After a week I realized she was not taking her noon meds, not eating lunch or answering her cell phone. I called Home Health and scheduled a RN, a bath aide, and a PT. By the end of November I couldn't leave her alone. She wouldn't and couldn't get out of bed by herself. I had to sleep on the sofa bed because she called for me in the middle of the night. I had to go back to work and made the decision to put her in a nursing home. She seemed to understand I couldn't take care of her. She was losing memory terrible. She has been in a wheelchair since 2008 and has atrophy in her legs. She has severe osteoporosis and had 8 fractured vertebrae in her back since 1998. She weighed 110 in October and lost 14 lbs in a month. She didn't want to eat and refused to take her vitamins and supplements. December 1 I put her in a nursing home where she is on hospice. I was thinking it wouldn't be long before she would pass. She always told me she didn't want to live the way she now is living. It is so sad. She wants to come home, but I can't take care of her. It takes two people to pick her up out of bed, to the commode and to the wheelchair. She can not carry a conversation. Doesn't remember much. She asks me how she can get better and I tell her the truth. There are no doctors that can make her better. Jesus is the great healer and I gave her permission to go to Jesus. I gave her Tylenol for pain, but it wasn't enough. So Hospice nurses got the order for morphine. She says she is constantly in pain and they don't do anything about it. I found out Mom has been refusing the pain medication. I think she has so much brain loss, she can not comprehend. She fell out of the wheel chair and out of the bed. They put a monitor on her. I have POA and she made out a living will and DNR long time ago. The quality of life is terrible. She talks, but it really isn't a complete conversation. She asks me how to make it better and how she can get out of the nursing home. I can't go see her every day and it just breaks my heart when I do. I don't know what keeps her going. She is just fading away. I am afraid she is going to end up with pneumonia and struggle to breath. It has to be easier dying in a coma than with pneumonia. I feel like I am deceiving her because I told her she could die at my house and I would be with her. She asked me what she could do and I keep saying I don't know. Can I tell her to stop eating and drinking and she will die and go to heaven to be with the great healer, Jesus? Will the nurses get concerned that I am trying to kill my mom? I know this is inevitable and she is suffering in a body that can't do what it could a year ago. It is heart breaking. The Hospice Nurses even say she is not suffering. I disagree. I know my mom in her right mind would not want to be like this. One of the nurses said we can't give her more morphine that would just kill her. This is really hard. The nurses are feeding her pureed food now and that is just enough to keep her alive. Please don't get me wrong, I love my mother very much, but I know she would not want to live like this in her right mind. I don't like this dying process, just waiting until she dies little by little.","I felt like I was reading my story with my grandmother. I have been exactly where you are and it wrenches the heart. It is so very difficult to deal with. My Gma would beg me to ""put her down"" like a dog. I can not tell you how many times I left the assisted living center in tears. I wish I can say it will get better but I can't. Hang in there and know we understand how you feel.


 Just an update. My mom was on hospice until April. Surprisingly she did not die. After three months of spending most of her time in bed and eating very little, her energy level came back and she spends most of her day roaming the halls of the nursing home. They took her off hospice. I go to visit once a week. This summer I noticed she would forget my name, but she was so happy I came to visit. One day I arrived in the morning for a care meeting, but I went to see her first. She said ""I haven't seen you in a long time."" We visited and I told her I was meeting with the head nurse and social worker. After the meeting I went back to say good bye and she said the same thing to me, ""I haven't seen you in a long time. "" I left to pick up the kids and returned about 3 pm and sure enough she said the same thing to me. Her dementia is so bad. She doesn't feel anything is important to remember. She lost her glasses in another residents room two months ago and when I ask her she says, ""I don't wear glasses, never have."" We have no idea where they are and she doesn't want them. Life is interesting, you can never really plan as it never goes the way you expect. I was planning a funeral, but guess again. My mom is still with me, not the same, but different and our new normal. Thanks for listening.


 Unfortunately for some older people and their loved ones, euthanasia is not allowed in most of the US. It's hard to watch someone we love slowly disappearing. I think first you must find a way to stop blaming yourself because you can't care for your mom. You've done everything you possibly could to give her a peaceful end and it's unfair to expect more from yourself. Sometimes some short-term counseling with a grief counselor can help. I think the more conflicted you are about this decision, the more difficult it will be for your mother to accept that this is where she lives now. It isn't a temporary step, and both of you need to work to accept that. In your own mind and in your visits with your mother, try to concentrate on happy memories and good times from the past. This is where her mind is focused now, and what she will remember best. I don't recommend suggesting she stop eating and drinking. Watching a loved one starve to death is brutal, and dying that way is even more brutal. Depending on the laws in your state, sometimes it just results in a feeding tube being placed to feed the person. There are others here who have shared your position who will be able to give you more wise counsel. Remember to love yourself.


 Hi Snookie! I'm sorry you are having to go through this! I have felt many of the things you described, with my Dad. He has been going through this journey since 2007. It has been really hard on me. I was fortunate enough that he moved to a nursing home out of state last year, near a sibling, so I am not having to live with it on a daily basis anymore. Not long ago, my sibling was out of the country and I received a call they expected he had less than 24 hours to live. I raced to fly there so he wouldn't be alone as he died. Long story short, he ended up living and continues to. I couldn't do the daily visits my sister does. I would leave in tears every time and found myself getting more and more upset. He is in a state of not knowing me (has been for years now), unable to talk, only able to eat or drink thickened and pureed. It also is horrible that he hasn't been able to do anything for himself for years now. He is in a wheel chair and basically is changed routinely and fed routinely and put to bed for naps and night. It is a horrible life we would never put a pet through, but the laws in our states require he be kept alive. I wish I could encourage you in some way, but the only true encouragement I can give is to tell you, you are not alone. It is a terrible disease...others understand your pain...hopefully, there will be a discovery of a cure soon, so the next generation will not have to go through this. God bless you and your Mom!


 Isn't life grand. My dad is reaching the point to where he can't feed himself. Mom who's been in an assisted living place for two months now is overly upset that we abandoned her. Both raise such a fuss everyday that the caregivers avoid them so they aren't getting the care they should."
Hallucinations when sick with fever or dehydration?,"Hi All, I am new to this forum, I live in Bucharest, Romania. My dad, 77, has been diagnosed with AD last summer (August 2015), after a pulmonary infection with fever. He started to hallucinate and to agitate, my mother was so scared that we scheduled an appointment to a geriatric doctor. After MMSE, his score was 23 from 30. The doctor diagnosed him with AD initial stage and put him on Exelon patches, 9,3 mg. All went well until this May, when he contacted Clostridium Difficile and had again fever and diarrhea with dehydration and started again to hallucinate and to be very agitated. I was in the hospital for infectious disease for 10 days, then he continued treatment at home...after getting a bit well he stopped hallucinating; after 2 months he had a relapse and again hallucinations and agitation. After 4 days again in the hospital, now he seems to be stable, but very weak. He has been now evaluated and he is AD stage 2 - mild to moderate. He is taking now also Ebixa 2/day and Depakine 1 in the evening. I don't know what to think, is this Alzheimer's or another type of dementia? He is confused and hallucinates only when sick with an infection (fever). Did someone on this forum experienced this situation with his/her loved one? I would very much appreciate your feedback, I am very worried and stressed and love my father very much. Thank you, guys. Anca","Thank you, Steve for your quick reply. It seems that Sundowners keeps them agitated in the evening and during night. My father sleeps well most of the times, he is only confused with hallucinations when he is sick. Doctors say that is Alzheimer's, but I still wonder. I am very afraid for him not to get sick because of these behaviors.


 Hi, I'm sorry for your father's diagnosis. Every Alzheimer patient's experience will be different, but my father went through pretty much the same thing that your father is going through. I know how frightening it can be. My father experienced many infections in the latter stages of his disease, and his doctors explained to us that whenever he had an infection, it would affect his mind, making him have hallucinations and erratic behavior. He wouldn't know us or where he was and even forgot that my mother had died during these times. He would have terrible bladder infections, but once the infection subsided, the hallucinations and such would go away. But he would go through that over and over. But he did have good days in between and we tried to enjoy those times as best we could. My father's Alzheimer's affected the functioning of his organs and that's why he would experience the infections. Keep in mind that Alzheimer's can affect any part of the brain, including the body's physical functions.


 You are welcome. My father passed away 3 years ago from they physical complications caused by the Alzheimer's, but he died with his short-term memory still mostly intact. He knew his children, but his long-term memory had faded and blurred. He never lost his knowledge of his faith in God, though, and he was at peace about dying. As difficult as it is to lose a parent, there comes a time when you know it's their time to rest from their suffering and let them go. Both my parents died from debilitating diseases, and as much as I miss them still, I would not have wanted to see them continue to suffer as they did. They had lived long, full lives, and were ready to go.


 Daddy's neurologist said he probably had it for many years before we started noticing any symptoms. We were suspicious that he had it years before his diagnosis, but we weren't sure because he was under tremendous stress trying to care for my sick mother for about 10 years. We didn't know if it was just the stress or actual Alzheimer's. Daddy had 3 or 4 uncles/aunts who were diagnosed before him, so we weren't surprised when he was diagnosed.


 You have probably already noticed that you and your dad have changed places. He is now like your child. Don't try to argue with him on anything. If he says he doesn't like what you're wearing - just agree with him. The good news/bad news is that he'll forget what you talked about in a matter of hours. Both of my parents can get down right mean and nasty with everyone..... Two hours later they can can be sweet as can be. My sister and I were concerned that mom might get kicked out of the center she is in. Luckily the head person explained that they expect and are used to dealing with the meanness and that they are seeing some good progress... Not to mention they won't kick her out. YEA!!


 He might possibly have Sundowners which both of my parents have. /www.agingcare.com/Articles/sundowners-syndrome-133187.htm Or it could simply be the fever since it appears that is the only time he's not doing really well.


 Another thoughts / experiences? Please help, I am a devastated daughter, I can't accept that my father became like this.


 Thank you JaSanne, this is valuable information. Does your father still lives or he passed? Did he pass due to Alzheimer's, or an infection caused by this terrible disease? I am trying to lift my father's immunity right now, he had also prostate cancer with RT last year...I give him supplements like Ganoderma, Colsotrum, Echinaceea, vit C, Manuka honey and probiotics. I know that we have to take care with him by preventing any possible infection, as much as we can. Is this realistic, or it's just my desire to keep him alive as much as I can? Thank you in advance for your response. May God protect us all!


 I am sorry for your parents. Yes, you're right about suffering so much, but I am not yet prepared to loose them. They are 77, and my father's diseases came so quick, only in 1 and a half year, I am still confused and mad about this....he was a very active man, now he's like a candle...it's hard to accept:( Thank you very much for your feedback.


 My dad also had his late mother, a cousin and uncle with Alzheimer's and Parkinson, so I should've expect this. But it's still very hard to accept and to get use to this idea. My father has been diagnosed last year, after a pneumonia with fever, when again he started to be confused and hallucinated. After this episode I took him at a geriatric doctor who evaluated him during long tests (2 hours, including MMSE) and she put the diagnostic of incipient stage of ALZ. She put him on Exelon patches 9.3 and all went pretty well until this spring, after contacting Clostridium Difficile....again fever, together with diarrhea and dehydration, he started again to have hallucinations. After first episode of Clostridium and treatment, again he was fine for 2months, then a relapse, again hallucinations, treatment and now stabilized....I took him to a psychiatrist who diagnosed ALZ mild to moderate stage. She added Ebixa (memantine) and Depakine in the night to calm down. He is also taking from many years Cipralex (Lexapro) for depression. I really dont't know what to expect further....if anyone experienced such episodes with a loved one, please just let me know. I don't know anymore what to think....Please help with suggestions. Thanks a lot.


 My Dad(deceased) nor my Mom(yet) hadn't had hardly any illnesses, infections. The reasons they had hallucinations were from the meds they were on. After their meds were changed, the hallucinations disappeared. Good to hear Steve. Everyone needs to be somewhere, where they are looked after properly, no matter how they interact with other people."
Are these to be expected from mom with Alzheimer's?,"I would be thankful for any advice that you can give. My mother is in a nursing home and has obvious confusion sometimes, short term memory loss, but most of all she has a lot of hallucinations. She tells me she see these things that I know haven't happened, like some man is chopping off little kids arms and legs in front of her and everyone else is just ignoring it. She tells me she has gone places, when I know she hasn't; tells me she is now walking, when I know she can't. She told me once the arm cutting guy was in her closet, so I looked to show her he wasn't, and she told me he built an escape door in there and got out in the other room. I tried to show her there was no such door, but she got really mad at me. She also call apartments to set up appointments to go view them with the intention of moving out of the nursing home...I have gotten a call from one of them checking on her references! They give her seroquel, but it doesn't seem to touch the hallucinations. She also has Parkinson’s and the meds can cause hallucinations, but I am not sure they cause full blown movies 24/7. She also has Hep C, so maybe her liver is starting to take a dive as well. I'm just not sure what to do. All I know is that she wants me to take her and all the kids she thinks live in the nursing home with no arms out so we can buy them coats for the winter. I tell her they don't exist, that it is her meds or something that makes her think they do. She gets very mad at me and starts yelling and cussing at me. Is this to be expected behavior? How do you all deal with things like this?","My mother had similar symptoms as she suffered with Alzheimer's. She too, was on seroquel, which did help alleviate the problem but not completely. She would see ""messages"" on the wall that were telling her terrible news...interesting, given she was nearly blind from macular degeneration. Other hallucinations as well. As the disease progressed these hallucinations seemed to stop, or she couldn't communicate them any longer.


 Yes, hallucinations are common, I'm told. My DH with AD began having them this past year.. He sees and talks with his mother who,passed away over 20 years ago. He'll ask me where those girls went when no one has been at our house all day. He usually insists that he is right and talked with ""them"" and will check different rooms looking for them. He is not on any medications that would cause hallucinations but he does has sundowners and is much worse at night.


 Steve n Dallas thanks for sharing the link for the article. I really appreciate it!


 Rotheron, I think it is very advisable that you ask her doctor about the possibility that your Mum has Lewy Body dementia. Lewy Body Dementia is well known to be linked with Parkinsons, and hallucinations are much more common in Lewy Body Dementia than in alzheimer's. It is very important to know, especially as some of the antipsychotic medications can make sufferers of Lewy Body Dementia extremely ill. Also, some medications used in Parkinsons can worsen the dementia, unfortunately. So it's important that your Mum's doctor make every effort to get the correct diagnosis. Good luck, Elena


 Seeing 'people' can be LBD (lewy body dementia). It's important to know what type of dementia she has, as some treatments for AD can make LBD worsen.


 Sounds like she might have Sundowners Syndrome which affects many elderly people who suffer from Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. My dad has it... It normally affects him in the after noon after he's woken from a nap. Here is one of many articles on the subject: www.aplaceformom.com/senior-care-resources/articles/sundowners-syndrome


 My Father who has Alzheimers has issues with sundowners syndrome very badly, especially when he is away from home. He was in the hospital in March and I stayed with him a couple of days because of how bad he would get, and he thought he was back in the army, he kept asking how could he get out of this, that he didn't remember signing up for this, and he hopes they don't keep his check(when he got paid in the army he would send his money to his parents, and when he got out they spent it all due to alcoholism). He would cock a gun, and it was traumatic for him. They gave him some ativan which only made him worse to where they had to restrain him in the bed. He does much better at home, he does get up during the night always looking for his check book, and frequently forgets the day and year, just a very sad illness.


 Hello Alice! Thank you for sharing what might work with my mother. All along I thought that telling her that what she saw were not true could make her realize that she's just hallucinating but it turns out that it is not what she needs. Thank you for clearly explaining what validation therapy is as now I know how to deal with her without aggregating her condition. Do all nursing homes practice validation therapy when reality orientation does not work? If not, can I request it from the director or the one managing the nursing homes?


 Sundowner's Syndrome affects people with their symptoms when the sun sets. If this happens all day, I would think it's just dimentia. The Hep C wouldn't affect the Alzheimer's at all. Have you mother exercise and get out of the nursing home a few times. Maybe a change of atmosphere would help her out. Good luck!


 Some further info on Lewy Body dementia and the drug issue, from UCSF (my boldface): ""ndividuals diagnosed with Lewy body dementias often have adverse reactions including confusion when taking medications that affect the brain , such as anti-anxiety drugs (examples: Valium®, Ativan®), anticholinergic drugs (examples: Benadryl®, Detrol®), and antiparkinson’s drugs (examples: Sinemet®, Mirapex®). To avoid adverse reactions to medications, physicians should carefully monitor medications, introduce medications one at a time and prescribe minimal doses when possible. Diagnosis An extensive neurological and neuropsychological evaluation is essential for Lewy body dementia diagnosis. Structural brain imaging (e.g., MRI or CT) and laboratory tests are used to rule out other diagnoses. Lewy body dementias can be difficult to diagnose because they can resemble and overlap with other causes of dementia like Alzheimer’s disease, other parkinsonian syndromes (examples: progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal syndrome), and vascular dementia. As in many neurodegenerative diseases, a definitive diagnosis in only available after an autopsy. However, clinical diagnosis by experienced providers can be quite accurate and reliable. Disease progression Onset of the disorder usually occurs in older adults, and disease risk increases with age. There is substantial variability in the course of the illness. In general, symptoms progress over several years as cognitive decline becomes more prominent and psychiatric symptoms emerge or worsen. The progression of symptoms represents increasing pathology in the brain including more widespread Lewy bodies, loss of neurotransmitters (examples: dopamine and acetylcholine) and nerve cell death. Management and treatment of Lewy body dementias Lewy body dementia patients are often frail, and their symptoms can worsen quickly when faced with infection, medication reactions or changes in the environment; these risks should be closely monitored. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including physical, occupational and speech therapy, community resources and assistance with home care should always be considered. The motor symptoms of Lewy body dementias are generally treated with dopaminergic therapies. These medications are usually helpful in decreasing the severity of motor symptoms. However, it is advisable for these medications to be initially prescribed at a low dosage and gradually titrated upwards as necessary given the possibility of potential side effects such as worsening confusion and hallucinations. Cognitive symptoms of Lewy body dementias are often treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., Rivastigmine®, Aricept®). These medications can improve the attention deficits, cognitive fluctuations, neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, apathy, anxiety), and sleep disturbances by boosting acetylcholine in the brain, a neurotransmitter that is severely reduced by these diseases. Memantine has also been tried for treatment of cognitive impairment in Lewy body dementias. In general, the results have suggested that this drug is well-tolerated but not reliably effective. Depression is very common in Lewy body dementias and can be treated with antidepressant medications. For psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations or delusions) that are troublesome to the patient and/or family and that are non-responsive to psychosocial interventions (e.g., making changes in the patient’s environment) or cholinesterase inhibitor treatment, atypical second generation antipsychotic medications such as risperidone (Risperdol®) and quetiapine (Seroquel®) can be tried but must be used cautiously due to the risk of motor and cognitive side effects. Older, first generation antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol (Haldol®) or chlorpromazine (Thorazine®) should be avoided because they can cause extreme adverse reactions in many Lewy body dementia patients. A patient treated with these drugs could become catatonic, lose cognitive function and/or develop more muscle rigidity. The symptomatic treatments available and described above do not slow down the disease course. The current search for disease-modifying drugs is focused primarily on preventing the misfolding and buildup of alpha-synuclein pathology in the brain."" source: http://memory.ucsf.edu/education/diseases/dlb There is actually some exciting news due out soon re progress in understanding Dementia with Lewy Bodies - I'll post it here soon.

Taking my dad out of dementia care faciity,"My dad was put in a dementia care facility a week ago when my mom went on a cruise, Everyday he asks us to take him home. We want to bring him to his lake cabin for the weekend but the facility is discouraging us because it might set him back. They have been giving him Lorazepam 3 times /day and as needed. They say to us it will get better. He pretty much takes care of himself, very healthy guy other than alzheimers. We are not concerned at all about us not being able to take care of him outside of the facility. They also have in so many words discouraged our visits. We are heartbroken! I just want the best for him. Is it better to leave him there or take him to the lake?","I agree that it isn't normal for the staff to discourage your visits. No one has ever mentioned that to us even when my Mom complains about being in the Home(that she chose). We took Mom to Her home 4 times but then we stopped since she told several family members, that if she ever went to Her home again that she would never go back to the Home, where she is. I know that is true. We feel bad about it but she has severe OA, can barely walk and her memory is awful. As far as your Dad, if you think that he will go back to the Home after his visit to the cabin, then go for it. Just be prepared that you may end up looking after him until your Mom gets back from her cruise. Alzheimers/Dementia is a very difficult and sad situation for all involved unfortunately. :(


 Cladue, you could take your dad other places. When we take Mom out on our visits now, we go shopping for her clothes and she likes to pick up some fruit and cookies for snacks(she doesn't want theirs). We take her to church, then to a restaurant and to another place that she would enjoy, like a museum. We took her to the park, to the beach, to visit her friend in another home and last time to a Nursery. The flowers were gorgeous and she bought one for her room. She wouldn't ""plant' herself in these places since Her home is her destiny(an hour away from the Home). And she doesn't know how to call a taxi. I gave her a long list of her friends and family members to call and who visit and/or call her. They all know not to take her to Her home.


 I know that this is a few weeks since this was posted, but I agree with others - this facility's tactics are raising a big warning flag to me. My father was in an Alzheimer's unit and they encouraged visits and the family taking him out for anything he felt like doing. The only thing that kept us from overnight visits was his need for medical equipment (for other ailments) at the unit that we couldn't take with us. Before my father was seen by a neurologist and diagnosed, my father was put on lorazapam by my sibling's doctor, who had seen him briefly while he was staying with this sibling. He became uncontrollable and far worse, and I and another sibling took him off of it as soon as he was back with us. It may help some patients, but it made things worse for my father.


 When will mom be coming back? Will he get out then? It's funny that both of my parents can't remember that one of us kids visited yesterday but they can remembered that we abandoned them. You're writing the checks so you get to decide how to work with dad. On the other hand, if you take him out for the weekend and have to put him back in on Monday for another week or so, I can see how that might stress him even more.


 When my grandmother was in the dementia ward of an assisted living center, they encouraged us to stop in frequently and if we take her out for more than a day, to just sign her out and sign a release form. They never discouraged in the least to not visit nor take her out. I don't know, it sounds a bit strange to me that they are doing this. And to say it will get better?? Alzheimer's doesn't get better, it declines. Sounds like you might want to look into different facilities.


 Hi Cladue: My sympathy to you and your family with this decision! Was this placement in a ALF while mom went on a cruise seen as respite or this ended up being the time his room was ready? Do you believe he needs Lorazapam three plus times per day to calm him down /decrease agitation? That seems excessive ? Taking a family member back to their original home after moving out can making them very confused!!! Dad spending time at the ALF as much as possible . Do they have established activity directors that have programs going during the day? Usually spread out from am and pm. Where they saying your visits were Interfering with him attending activities ? You should be able to visit family as much as you want. 10 days is too early to assess his adjustment there. 3 months is a better assessment of his progress. I asked these questions because in mid June I placed my father in a beautiful ALF after caring for him 18 years in my home. He had been diagnosed with Dementia about 1 yr ago. With that diagnosis came daily confusion, worsening each day, increase number of falls, He also has Parkinson's Syndrome., I quit my job. It had gotten to The point where he absolutely could not be left alone day or night. I paid skilled care to come in and help. My husband and I looked for ALF. We also applied for Va. Benefits under his behalf. We had assistance in completion. It took us about 1 mo. To complete. And we are still waiting to hear. It can take 4-6 months. That money can be used towards his ALF or Nursing home care. At our ALF, they do daily activities, they have bus trips that are for non Alzheimer's patients. On the ALF floors, they do activities and bus trips for just their floors. If the mom or dad is constantly taken From the ALF by a family member, they have no time to enjoy and build relationships. At this time, my dad is in a Longterm Care skilled Nursing home and Rehab Unit. (which is attached to his old unit) I hope he gets strong enough to go back ""to his old room in ALF"". He fell 4 times in 7 weeks . That's why he is in rehab now. Good days/ bad days/ good memories and full on dementia when he doesn't remember what he had for lunch 1 HR before. I yearn for our old relationship back! Not to be now. Taking 1 moment at a time. I got a little of where you are coming from. 🌻😊"
"Mom has Alzheimer’s, test for me?","My mom has it, and I am scared I may get it later on, I have memory problems now but that can be attributed to the other meds I take. Do they have a test that could detect in me this early?","Another strong risk factor is family history. Those who have a parent, brother, sister or child with Alzheimer’s are more likely to develop the disease. The risk increases if more than one family member has the illness. When diseases tend to run in families, either heredity (genetics) or environmental factors, or both, may play a role. www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_causes_risk_factors.asp There is no single test that proves a person has Alzheimer's. A diagnosis is made through a complete assessment that considers all possible causes. www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_steps_to_diagnosis.asp"
Father recently diagnosed with Alzheimers,"My Father was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, at first before we knew he had it, there were some signs that we thought something maybe wrong with his memory, but he functioned very well, walked 4 miles every day, was always gong somewhere, very active. Just in the last couple of months you can see a decline in him, he has to ask how old he is, he repeatedly asks what the day, year, month etc. He was in the hospital last month for a bleeding ulcer, and apparently he has a very rough time at night, the nurse said he has ""sundowners syndrome"", his gets worse at night, my Mom says he gets up and down a lot during the night checking for his wallet and check book. He barely will do anything anymore, he usually just sits by my Mom, and repeatedly tells her how much he loves her, and how beautiful her hair is, he is not the same man I knew, my heart breaks for him, I have taken this so very bad, I never really understood Alzheimers and the devastation it can cause, I sure wish I never found out!","Do your parents dance, or have another activity they did together? My wife has forgotten a lot of things, but she hangs on to some things that mean the most to her. One of them is dancing. She has been an expert dancer since her teenaged years. I take her dancing three times a week and it makes her very happy because she holds on to the memory long enough for the next night I take her out. If your father has one activity that he hasn't forgotten, his wife can help him a lot by doing it with him. If that activity is mainly walking, perhaps she can join him. Four miles is a long walk, so maybe she can get him to shorten the walk to whatever is comfortable for her. It will give him a chance to have happy memories with her that will hopefully last to the next walk....


 Brenda - the sad part is it's going to get worse. You'll quickly learn to NOT argue with him. If he thinks he's right about a subject - just agree with him...as long as it's not a really important subject. When he asks about Christmas - just tell him it'll be here before he knows it... The good news here is that tomorrow he'll forget he asked about Christmas. The hard part - my dad for example is three times more sharp in the morning than he is in the afternoon. He knows his memory is shot and he can have quite a discussion about it. In the afternoon he doesn't know where he is and who the people around him are.


 I am so sorry, Brenda! It hurts so bad to watch the ones we love struggle. Treasure the good moments, you are clearly a very loving and caring daughter. Do you all have lots of local support with friends and family? HUGS!! ~Ducktapetherapy77


 Sorry to hear about your dad.. My dad has sundowners too. It usually kicks in after an afternoon nap. Supposedly, if you turn on a bunch of lights and make the room as bright as possible it'll help with sundowners.


 Thank you for your replies, he doesn't forgot every thing, he knows he walked but no longer really desires doing it, I believe it is because he is away from my Mother. He does walk each morning to get his paper, but it isn't like the walking he used to do. He remembers all of us, I'm not sure how they stage it, but he seems to forgot more things like the year, his age, the month, day, He just asked my Mother when was Christmas, I guess he forgot we already celebrated it. I guess it is just tough when you see your parent in this situation, and as I stated before I never knew really what Alzheimers was all about , I never knew how much people lose.


 Wow Steve, that is so sad, My father is sharper in the morning, but as the day progresses he gets worse, he has good days and he has bad days. It's just so sad to see someone that was so full of life become like this, my Father is 74, not sure how old your Father was when he was diagnosed. I asked him why he didn't like to go out anymore, he said it makes him nervous. The last time he took me to the store(months ago) he would pace the front of the store scared to death that he lost us, so now when he goes shopping he just stays with my Mom.


 Thank you Duck, we support him greatly, and my Mother is a wonderful caretaker for him. I will break down on the phone when I talk to him, because just his voice sounds very sad, he will tell me he is okay...it is just a very painful experience, just so sad that anyone has to go through this."
Leukine as possible treatment,"I've read that leukine is being testing in a clinical trial to study possible effects on Alzheimers. It was noticed by researchers that rheumatoid arthritis patients almost never developed Alzheimers. One hypothesis that has been successfully tested in mice is that the protein GMCSF is released into the blood in RA patients. This protein then gets into the brain and prevents alzheimers. This same protein is in the drug leukine. Leukine is an FDA approved drug used after bone marrow transplants or after chemotherapy to treat neutr openia, a side effect of the chemo. My understanding is that in the US any medical doctor can prescribe a drug for indications other than the approved indication, ""off-label.' However in some cases this off label use may not be reimbursed by insurance. Does anyone have experience or knowledge of any doctors prescribing leukine off label for alzheimers? I'm sure someone has picked up on this possibility. We just returned from another disappointing visit to the neurologist with my mother in law, who has alzheimers. The doc basically offered no good treatments other than what she has been taking - Numenda and Exelon - which he admitted don't really do anything. Leukine is in the early stages of testing and if successful wouldn't be approved until too late for us. We are looking for options if anyone can help thanks Lou", 
Do we have Alzheimer’s in the family?,"It has been 25 years since my beloved grandma died at the age of 80. For as long as I can remember, and I grew up with her, she suffered from dementia. At the time (late 80's) nobody mentioned Alzheimer. But I've been thinking about the possibility that she may have had it. She could only recognize people she lived with (my aunt, mom and me). At some point she stopped recognizing her own son, because he didn't visit often. She wouldn't talk about her past like most senile people do, and not remember what happened the day before. She would only repeat several questions and had several types of behavior. She would ask me not to run (as if I had been a baby) and she would repeat one word endlessly like a broken record. I'm afraid that left to her own devices she would not have eaten or drunk. She used to walk with a cane, but slowly lost the ability to walk all together and we had to put her in a wheelchair. She was unable to attend to her own basic needs. We helped her out with everything. Doctors kept talking about dementia and giving her Codergocrine mesilate. She used to take bunch of medication each morning. We gave it to her, that is. She was not depressed. She used to smile all the time when we spoke. She would never get angry or feel disoriented or embarrassed. Sometimes at night she would call out, for my aunt mostly. Maybe then she would need some reassurance, but not during the day. She was never alone, not for a second. We suffer from cardiovascular diseases in the family and somehow I took it fro granted that she was just senile. But, as I said, I started having doubts... It would really help me immensely to hear your opinions and experiences.","Thank you for your answer. I think she started losing cognitive ability when she was about 73.


 What you described does sounds like Dementia/Alzheimer."
Opportunity for Family Caregivers,"Hello, Peter Waite has given me permission to post the following information. My name is Marisa and I am currently a Senior at Union College in Schenectady, NY. I am inviting family caregivers of persons with Dementia and Alzheimer's to participate in a brief study of the effects of writing (journaling) about one's experiences coping with the stresses of caregiving. Previous research has shown that even brief writing sessions may reduce stress and increase coping. I am conducting this study in coordination with my thesis supervisor, Professor Hanley, and it is approved by the Union College Human Subjects Review Committee (IRB). I have developed an online version of this study which includes all of the materials needed for participants to complete it. The website link is www.caregiverstudy2015.weebly.com. The study requires the completion of a brief pre-journaling survey, 3 consecutive days of journaling for 20 minutes at a time, and then a one-week follow-up survey. Before beginning the study, all participants would need to email the researcher at caregiverstudy2015@gmail.com to be assigned their subject number and writing prompt I am hopeful that you and/or those in your caregiver circle, will be interested in participating. If you would like more information or have any questions, please contact me via email me at:caregiverstudy2015@gmail.com.

"Zoning out, memory loss, out of character anger","Long story. My dad is currently 75 years old. Diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 73 and treated with radiation therapy. didn't handle the cancer diagnosis and treatment well. Got a bladder infection that went untreated, spread to his brain that lead to a 4 month hospital stay, severe depression, and ECT treatment. This all ended in September of 2014. It is now about 1.5 years later. My dad has never been the same, but recent events are making us wonder. about three weeks ago my dad was watching tv while something was cooking on the stove. The food burnt, causing a small fire. Smoke was in the house and the smoke detector was beeping. it didn't seem to phase my dad. My mom ran upstairs and alert ed him to the issue and they put it out. Odd he wouldn't react. But in another room watching a soccer game. Maybe focus was elsewhere. One week later my mom went to visit one of her friends. She tell my mother that my dad called her house and was cursing at her and her husband over the phone. These are family friends so no understanding as to why he would ever do that. My mother asked my father about the phone call. He denies ever making them. (call was on a wednesday, my mother confronted him on the following Monday). We checked outgoing calls and sure enough our house did call the friends house on specified day. My mother didn't call them. Again, he denies making the call or having any recollection of calling. To that, these are friends so there is no reason for dad to call them and curse at them. Zoning out, forgetfullness/memory loss, out of character anger. I don't know what to make of this. We were told that there could be longer term side effects from ECT that cause memory loss. he is depressed, no doubt. Just not too sure what to make of it. Doctor recommends that he first get blood and urine work done to rule out infection. We do not have a history of dementia in our family. I don't know what to make of it. When i mentioned the idea of dementia/azheimer's to my dads doctor, he said we are not there yet. Not sure what to make of all this. Very confusing. The worst part is my dad thinks we are accusing him of being crazy and that really brings him down. Anyone ever hear about something like this? I can't find a mental health page so i thought i'd start here.","Sounds like dementia to me. Not remembering things from yesterday is a common sign. Not remembering things from two hours ago is even worse.


 Did you ever get a resolution to this problem? I'm very curious if this turned out to be dementia. My loved one's doctor is dismissing similar signs and I also think dementia is a possibility."
How does one get dental work done with Dementia?,"You can ask for light sedation. But that is sort of tricky because it might mess with her mind. My Gma could have the light sedation but general anesthesia was a major no-no. As for the other procedures, sedation wouldn't be an option (especially for a vision test lol). There might be some tests that will have to be overlooked because it might not be feasible.","IMHO,let it go...............The stress would make her worse without anesthetic


 I saw my own dentist yesterday and asked him if he treated dementia patients and he said no. I then told him about the problems I had with my mom getting x-rays taken by her not biting on them consistently to get the shots. He told me he was getting a panoramic x-ray machine that would take the whole mouth in one shot. How cool is that? Well, I wouldn't want to burden him with my mom since he has no experience dealing with her condition. It's good to know they exist and maybe one day her dentist office will carry it also. For now, I just ask for patience from health care workers dealing with her. That brings up a good question though, how much training does doctors get on treating dementia patients for non dementia related problems? With people living longer now and getting this disease left and right I think it's pretty valid to ask. Sedation would not be good for my mom. I would never be able to get her home after wards. haha


 Makes me happy I don't have teeth.I can eat just as well with dentures as without......


 I can eat anything but nuts & chew ice,lol.........


 I wouldn't force the issue though......Why cause the person undo stress?


 May I see this fact sheet?


 So sorry about your father. I can only imagine how hard it was for you to see him go downhill in front of your eyes My dad died of cancer so he was a bag of bones when he left us. My mom cannot sit still not because of PD but because of her dementia. She's like a little kid. She looks around and bites down and won't keep her mouth open. She couldn't do the pan x-ray so we did the old fashion film kind and that lasted 2 hours. The good thing is she's good with her partials but she needs all the teeth she has left to hold them or else she will have to get full dentures and those will really be a pain although right now it's no picnic either. You said your father had NPH but then you said he had Alzheimer's and PD? I'm confused.


 Hi Jeffgamer, My mom has lost about 3 teeth since the surgery 2 years ago so we kept getting her partials redone and that includes parts breaking off and not fitting right as her remaining teeth are shifting. This was has been extremely costly for us but to see her smile and be able to eat is a blessing for us. The Benadryl works somewhat to relax so if your FIL can still follow directions then he may be more cooperating but not so much for long procedures. If and when you do find a good oral surgeon who will do sedation then the process should be easier. My mom is a petite woman so the drugs used were too much for her frame. That is something you need to keep in mind if and when you go ahead with it. Good luck! Always nice to be able to help so ask away if you have additional questions.


 General anesthesia can be very disorientating for some with AD while sedation is a ""twilight sleep"" and they don't do as heavy of medications as with general. With sedation, once the drug is stopped, the person wakes up.


 I'm not quite sure which medications they use for either general or sedation. I've never really asked to be honest Lol but you should ask to see if the meds will bother your mother.


 No...sedation is a light sleep. General is a deeper sleep. They use different medications. I'm just not sure which med is used for each procedure. I know when I go in for my colonoscopies they use Versed and I am awake immediately after they are done. But when I've been under general, they use a combination of meds and I feel extremely groggy afterwards.


 Hello, My mother needs to go to the dentist soon for a teeth cleaning and fillings. The last time I took her was over a year ago and it was quite a struggle to get x-rays taken of her cavities. We were there for 2 hours. Does anyone have experience with this from a loved one with Dementia who won't cooperate? This could apply to mammograms, vision test, etc where the patient need to follow directions.


 Yes sedation is out. My mom would be very disoriented and may not even open her mouth. My sister asked me this morning how people with Dementia get tested for things due this problem. I told her they probably don't and die from diseases that weren't detected. People don't die from Dementia, they die with it. As for teeth, they probably let it rot and fall out.


 I agree with Lynne. It might just cause more trouble then it's worth. BUT if she starts having toothaches and/or tooth infections, you may not have a choice but to do the sedation to have her mouth taken care of. I had to do that choice too with my Gma and had to weigh the pros and cons. But if ever in the case she needs sedations, there is no need to fear about her opening her mouth. Dentists and oral surgeons have manual mouth openers.


 There are some family doctors that have extra training in geriatrics and dementia. My Gma had a gem of a family doctor that treated her with respect and dignity because he was trained to do so. If you look up geriatrics physicians, then more then likely they know how to deal with dementia patients.


 Either you eat soft food or you have tough gums.


 I depending what food is n if im alone lol i mow down w/o dentures.. but they do say that you do not get the same amount of goodness outta food unless totally chewed hmmmmm idk lyn


 Hi guys, So much has happened since I started this posting but here goes. We finally found a great oral surgeon and his wife is a dentist. Together they worked 3 hours on my mom under IV sedation to extract and get crowns and fillings for 14 teeth total. In the end my mom got partials and even though it's become a part-time job for me to just take care of them I am happy to do so. The down side to this was it took my mom 23 hours to wake up from the sedation but when she did she was back to her normal self. Normal as she can be anyways. This was 10 months ago and now my mom has 4 cavities on the teeth she has left. The dentist is afraid to do sedation again because of the 20+ hours my mom slept and she's afraid it will be worse this time around. I left a message for her to call me back with a solution. I'm thinking.... Benadryl? It should only take about an hour to do the fillings so getting my mom sleepy is the ultimate goal so the dentist can do her thing ASAP. However if she really needs the IV sedation well, the short amount of time this requires would be way better than the 3 hour ordeal from last year so the risk should be way less. My mom is doing so well with the partials and eating very well with them and she looks really pretty. I don't want that to go down the drain and have her get infected from the cavities if it goes down to the gum line. Any thoughts?


 My mother was able to get two partials even though she has dementia and no extra sedation needed. The dentist did have panoramic xrays. I think the most important part of going for any treatment or diagnostic tests is to keep your parent calm and reassure them it will be alright. My father had normal pressure hydrocephalus and had to have brain surgery and that was tough. I was shocked after he woke up that the hospital wanted me in ICU with him 24/7 as he was a handful!! My husband took off of work to help me since both parents had dementia and even after leaving ICU and him in a regular hospital room, he still required one of us there with him. When my husband had to go back to work, they even had babysitters that came up to the hospital to sit with him at night. Unfortunately, Dad had both Parkinsons and Alzheimers, so the brain surgery didn't really help. Dad actually did pass away due to dementia. He first began forgetting how to eat, then eventually, loss of sight, and how to breathe. It is an absolutely horrible way to die. His death certificate lists ""senile dementia"" as the cause of death. Once he forgot how to walk, the steep decline came. Then it was one thing right after another that his mind lost how to do. I've seen a lot of people die in old age, but this was by far the worse way to go. I don't understand how anyone can say that a person doesn't die from dementia, as he sure did and it was absolutely a horrible way to go! I know of others who lost their parent due to dementia also; it definitely wasn't something unusual and they too spoke of how horrible the passing was.

 Hi, Bella33! We're in the same boat with my father-in-law. He believes he brushes his teeth twice a day, but, truth is...he NEVER does, except when my wife is there and has a ""tooth-brushing party"". He's got major periodontal disease now...dental hygienist looked in there and was very concerned...but he won't let anyone touch his bridgework (he doesn't even believe he has fake teeth). So we are trying to see if there is a sedation dentristry expert in our town (Miami) who will be willing to work with him. We don't think he can go on any longer without something being done...the consequences could be too severe. Did you ever go back a second time? You wrote that you were thinking of using Benadryl...you wrote that the sedation option worked well except for the long time before your mom work up. I guess I'm looking for any update and for reassurance again from someone who's had to go through this that this is indeed the wisest move.


 Hey guys, I'm baaaack... The great husband and wife team that worked on my mom have decided that they no longer want to treat my mom due to liability reasons. So in other words they have decided that they made enough $ off of my mom's teeth and can now retire to the Bahamas. I was so angry at first because I felt like they abandoned us at time of need. My mom currently has 3 small cavities on her bottom teeth and I have been searching for a new dentist since Jan. We tried one who claimed to be super patient and 20 minutes later it was adios. I now found another one who supposedly works with special needs cases so we'll see. My mom's family doc said no to general anesthesia but yes to sedation. I have no idea what the difference is. Anyhow... the dentist will try to do without and do the filings for my mom in 2 weeks and see how it goes. I will give her half a Benadryl again and hope for the best. I wish medical professionals would be more willing to take care of people like my mom. One day they will grow old and have difficulties too. Karma will be my best revenge for these people.


 Thanks. What drugs are considered sedation?


 oh.. then I guess I'm still confused then. I always assumed it means the same thing.


 My mom was on versed and fentanyl for her dental surgery and those were a powerful combination. Unless someone is getting operated on from the inside I really don't see why something so strong would be needed. My mom falls asleep from just sitting there for 5 minutes so Benadryl it is. Thanks."
Is it normal to have symptoms of Alzheimer's at the age of 30 ?,"I don't know whether I'm paranoid or it is happening for real . I took a break from work after we had our first child and barely did anything apart from taking care of my LO,cooking,laundry and cleaning. 2 years later I find myself finding it difficult to recollect names, my netbanking passwords, and some really crucial information which otherwise I would recollected even if you'd ask me when I'm asleep. Now I want to get back into corporate life and lack the confidence because I feel I am no longer the same smart individual I used to be. I am so scared !!!","Well Steve to tell you the truth, have you ever had a Head Injury or a Traumatic Injury. I had both at the age of 42 and was having ""BAD"" Tremors for a while and eventually they went away. That's when my Doc told me I was Showing Early Signs of Parkinson's Decease and Alzheimer's not a very good feeling having always been very athletic also, but I've learn to live with it and now they're finally getting some Very Good medicine's available for it I now use the Exceleron Patch and believe it or not it helps with a lot of my deficits.


 I would highly recommend anyone with cognitive disorders start mediating daily for at least 10 minutes. You can learn from another person or try online mindfulness meditations. There is a new report from Harvard indicating regular meditation can build gray matter in the brain.


 Hi Mystica, I've been dealing with similar symptoms too and it is very scary. I am only 35 and find it very frightening and frustrating that I can't communicate or function in the way that a person my age should be able to. I am trying to figure out what exactly is going on that is causing the problems but no answers yet. I feel for you because I can relate to how you are feeling.


 You sound rather human to me As we age, our memory isn't as sharp as it used to be. I had similar concerns a while back and asked my GP doc about em while getting a physical. I told him about the time I couldn't for the life of me remember my street number.. I was sitting in my darn living room and knew the name of the street but not the house number... I also mentioned I knew I could look on my drivers license and see the number... He said the fact that I knew I could look up the number was a very good sign... The then ask me if I had ever been away from home and didn't remember how to get home..... That would be a cause for concern. Also, repetitive tasks are the things that are easiest to forget... Did I take my baby aspirin this morning... Where are my darn car keys...


 cranewhiplash said... Well Steve to tell you the truth, have you ever had a Head Injury or a Traumatic Injury. Yes I have. Mind if I ask what your point is and how it'll help Mystica in her quest for feedback?


 Hi Mystica! Just want to tell you that I am familiar with your situation. My wife who has been working 8 years in a private company as a researcher delivered our first baby through a Ceasarean section 9 years ago. She was on leave from work for 2 months to allow healing of the surgical wounds as well as to take care of the baby. She noticed that she had a hard time recalling words and had to stop talking so she can think on the right words to say. We were informed by her gynecologist that it was one of the side effects of the anesthesia injected into her for the performed operation. When my wife returned to work she was frustrated with her inability to recall things and words. The doctor advised her to do memory games and answer crossword puzzles. She was also told to read more so she can learn or re-learn things. Working again can help her regain the normal function of her brain but it will take years to sharpen her memory. It did help but not 100%. But it is better than staying home. You'll get rusty from unuse if you will just do household chores. Do things to challenge your mind and ask for your husband's support. Trust in yourself that you can do it! If my wife can, so can you!"

"Mild cognitive impairment, any insights?","Hello Alzheimer's Forum! First of all, I want to express my condolences to all of you affected by this condition, and wish you the best of possible health and management of the issues going on in your/loved one's situations. My mom has been experiencing some short term memory loss and cognitive decline for some time. (going on about 2 yrs.) Today, we had her assessed by a neurologist who dx'd her with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) He said that this is not necessarily progressive, and that it may or may not develop into Alzheimer's eventually. He stated about 50% of patients with MCI go on to develop AD. Aside from this issue, mild depression and chronic Mono/fatigue, she is a healthy 78 year old, with no family history of AD. I suppose I am seeking any further information or personal experiences with MCI that anyone can offer. Thank you in advance, and again...the best of health management to all of you here! Scaredy Cat","Thank you Steve. :) I appreciate you taking the time to share your knowledge and personal experience with me. I am sure you are/were a wonderful carer for your dad! I will take the above advice...it is very helpful to talk to others who have been in the same place. I am sure I will be back eventually with more questions, updates, ect... Well wishes to all. S.C.


 For everyone reading: ""Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more serious decline of dementia. It can involve problems with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes. If you have mild cognitive impairment, you may be aware that your memory or mental function has ""slipped."" Your family and close friends also may notice a change. But generally these changes aren't severe enough to interfere with your day-to-day life and usual activities. Mild cognitive impairment may increase your risk of later progressing to dementia, caused by Alzheimer's disease or other neurological conditions. But some people with mild cognitive impairment never get worse, and a few eventually get better."" www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mild-cognitive-impairment/basics/definition/con-20026392 SC, I think everyone over 50 can relate to this.... My dad started here and ended up with full blown dementia.... I'd call him to say I was coming over...An hour later when I got there he was surprised to see me.. But things would go well with the visit and we do out to lunch etc and all was fine. Course a few days later he'd ask when I was coming over and that he hadn't seen me in a while... Try to keep your mom busy and make her use her brain to keep it active. If you haven't been there - don't argue with her... If it's on a subject that isn't too important - just agree with her. As the article above mentioned, she knows her memory is slipping. It'll make her frustrated at times... Just go with the flow. Good luck."
Dementia/Alzheimers Like Behaviors,"Hi I will just get to it... My grandma's behavior has changed tremendously.Maybe a few weeks ago my grandma had her first episode where she would become completely unresponsive. The first one happened at her residence where she sat down to eat and just sat there with here eyes closed and when you tried to talk to her she wouldn't say anything almost like she was sleeping as well as being hard to wake up. She was rushed to the hospital and the doctors couldn't find anything. The second time it happened I was with her and she was sitting in her chair unresponsive again. Also she doesn't want to eat, sleeps all day and her reasoning and rationality is not there, like for instance the other day my cousin and I were visiting her and my cousin stated that she didn't have a key to get in her house in case something happened. So my grandma gave her her own personal keys she used to get in with. And then a couple of days later my mom and I went to check on her because I wanted to sit and talk with her for a while she wasn't there but she left the door unlocked and told us that she needed to get a new set of keys made. Today she was moaning and squinting her eyes and talking loudly to God which is normal for her as well as repeating things over and over..... If anyone has went through this and know what is going on please help me it would be gladly appreciated! Thanks! P.S. Now she has trouble swallowing and in one her lucid moments she told us that she can hear what we are saying but just cant respond to us Update: Today the doctors told us that everything was normal and they didn't see any abnormalities in the EEG. Post Edited (L0v3Butt3rFly) : 3/22/2015 9:44:14 PM (GMT-6)","She does she has had episodes where she would smell things that weren't there. The only medications that she is on as far as my knowledge is Coumadin as well as a medication for some chemical unbalances. She is 83 years old and has been checked for strokes and it has come back negative. The doctor at the previous hospital she was rushed to said that it was advanced dementia but the hospital she is admitted to now hasn't said anything about it.


 It sounds she definitely have some mental issues going on. Is she on any type of medications? Does she have any other health issues? How old is she? She should go into see the doc to rule out other health issues. Has she ever been checked to see if she had a stroke? Usually dementia and Alzheimer's is a gradual process. Unresponsiveness is sometimes seen in the more advanced stages. That is why I really think she needs to be seen by a doctor. If in the event she is getting dementia, they have medications out there to slow the progression."

Alzheimer's and Diet,"Hi, My spouse was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last year. I've been trying to learn as much as possible to be able to care for her as it progresses. Anyway, recently, I read an article concerning the plaque in the brain and an abnormal ""sugar attachment"" indicating Alzheimer's is a diet based problem. Alzheimer's seems to have exploded in the last 30-40 years, and high fructose corn syrup has replaced cane sugar in our diets during this time. Corn syrup has played a major role in obesity since it doesn't digest the way can sugar does. I wonder if researchers are considering corn syrup as the source on these attachments.... Also, I wonder if any studies are being done comparing the Alzheimer's rate in our country versus countries with a cane sugar based diet. Does anyone know if there is info out there concerning this?","There are studies showing sugar can be harmful to the brain. If you deprive the body of sugar(carbohydrates) the brain has to burn fat. It is referred to as the Ketogenic Diet. You can limit the consumption of sugar(carbohydrates) in order to force the body to run on fat. Look at the link on coconut oil on this web site. Some people have success with using organic coconut oil. http://www.neurology.org/content/63/4/E9.full http://healthimpactnews.com/tag/ketogenic-diet/


 I just posted a link on the Pineal Gland and Fluoride and Alz. Water fluoridation has been going on in the U.S. since the late 1940's..... If only, we could get ENOUGH vits and minerals from our depleted food sources.... that's why they are supplements....to supplement what we don't get from foods.... I use coconut oil for everything, all my cooking, use it in foods and even my coffee....


 I have learned the value of Kineosology (muscle testing) and use it and have chiros who use this testing....I often use this for testing WHAT my body needs and wants and often the dosing....it's amazing....I believe in it....and I use pendulum work too on vits etc and for other stuff. I too take iodine daily and turmeric and and....keeping the body as alkaline as possible... Good to plant your garden, and I too buy organic as much as possible. I've been working alternatively for about 25 yrs and it's exciting and rewarding ... I'd be greater if it were not for the mess hip replacement in 2010....it was too lifechanging in not the best ways. J


 I do not use aluminum. There have been studies linking Aluminum exposure to Alzheimer's. I make my own deodorant. Sorry you have a hip replacement. I have a father with two hip replacements and a knee replacement. He has arthritis pretty bad. I try and encourage him to keep his body alkaline by eating fruits and vegetables. Think the body has a good chance of repairing the damage if you keep the acid out of your diet. http://www.rense.com/general37/alum.htm


 There is tons of info on the net... Many basically say: ""We still don't know how much and for how long specific foods affect disease risk, and we don't know how nutrition and genes interact to affect disease risk. But since we can't control our age and our family history, focusing on healthy eating seems to be a smart approach."" alzheimers.about .com/od/prevention/a/Alzheimers_and_Diet.htm


 Study showing vitamin E could be helpful in Alzheimer's. Think it is best to get these vitamins and minerals from the food we eat. http://naturalsociety.com/how-to-prevent-alzheimers-disease-vitamin-e/


 I plant a garden in the summer and buy organic as much as possible. I have a reverse osmosis water filter. I only use coconut oil and olive oil. I get my vitamin D from a sunscreen in the winter and from the sun in the summer. The only supplements I currently take is iodine and a Liposomal Vitamin C and turmeric solution. When I was detoxifying my body I was taking many vitamins, minerals and supplements. Now that I have my health back I feel I get what I need from the food I eat. The problem with vitamins and supplements is figuring out what your body needs. Also if you are not careful some of the vitamins and supplements have bad chemicals in them. Make sure you understand what all the ingredients are in the supplement. The manufactures like to use magnesium stearate. When you eat the proper food your body is smart enough to figure out what it needs. I try to stay on an alkalizing diet. Try to limit the amount of sugar and meat. It is working for me. http://www.buzzle.com/articles/magnesium-stearate-side-effects.html


 Years ago aluminum was discussed so much with Alz...I threw out all aluminum pots and even teflon skillet as teflon is coated in a fluoride chemical. It's maddening...I rarely use aluminum foil.....wax paper is a safe bet. j


 I read of someone being helped with coconut oil and I thought that was interesting, but didn't understand why. I just recently read magnesium deficiency produces confusion and loss of memory...so I then searched around a little and found coconut oil actually helps absorption of magnesium in the body (and brain)...so, I would suggest looking up those two. Going organic, having a ""clean diet"" may help as well."
Alzheimer’s is progressing so fast,"My mom has alzheimer's and still lives at home. My son, his wife and 2 small kids live downstairs and care for her. Today she got agitated and and left the house. Fortunately my daughter in law drove down the street and saw her. Mom was very mad and insisted they walk up and down the road. Anyway, this is progressing so fast that something needs to be done now. I was wondering if anyone can advise me on safety locks for the outside doors? I know it sounds so barbaric but I just want a way to keep her safe so she doesn't go out. I'm also thinking we need someone to come in a give them a break, but where do I start? She has Group Health Ins. maybe I should call her Dr. and see. Thank you for any advice or encouragement you can give","Thanks for the reply Steve n Dallas. I've tried those door knob covers and she figured them out. I know I'm worried about fire and people needing to get in and out. Maybe an alarm? I called the Dr. office and they will send out a social worker. It sounds like Ins. may cover some of this (fingers crossed).


 www.alzstore.com/alzheimers-dementia-wandering-s/1828.htm There are a number of different solutions on that page. The ""Confounding Door Lock"" might be a good fit for your situation. Good luck.

Alzheimer's and Eczema,Is Eczema very common for people with AD? Does Eczema happen before or after signs of AD? Thanks in advance.,My gma had AD but she didn't have eczema. Do you or a loved one have this?
Patients with dementia/Alzheimer's,"I certainly understand why there seem to be very few posts from patients with dementia/Alzheimer's, but if there are any of you out there I'd like to hear from you. Last year both my internist and rheumatologist told me to see their neurologist because I had memory problems. It started simply. I was going to cook oatmeal. In front of me I had a pot of water on the stove, container of oatmeal, measuring cup. For a few seconds I couldn't figure out how to get the oatmeal into to pot. Hmm. Ok. I have lupus and lots of brain fog, but I decided to tell my docs of this and other memory difficulties. Neurologist found that my frontal and temporal lobes shrank and my eeg shows decreased activity in my frontal lobe. I basically failed the tests he gave me in his office. Since then things have become much worse. If I can't quickly remember something, I give up. ""It will turn up. It's not that important."" Really, it's just too hard to think. And it's not just memory. I have days with what I consider major cognitive problems, but also thankfully have days with more clarity. I find it strange that I've never had much trouble expressing myself in writing, but when speaking I frequently forget words and what I was talking about . For lupus, depression, and other autoimmune illnesses I take heavy duty meds including two infusions each month. I see my neurologist again next week. I thought I'd check out your forum before I see him in case he comes up with bad news in which case I'm sure I will not feel like writing for a while. Love, Butterflake","Thanks for replying eat2bwell. The oatmeal incident is when I really thought I might have a problem. That was probably 1 1/2 years ago. For about 8 months after that only I noticed memory/cognitive problems. Now my family is very aware of my memory problems, but they don't notice the cognitive problems like I do. I will check out the ketogenic diet, but what I really want to know is, do you have Alzheimer's?


 I think eating well is common sense and I'm not quite sure why you are on our forum.


 When did the memory problem start. Can you related to a specific point in time and what changes were going on. If you are taking a lot of medications might discuss the possibility of drug interaction with your doctor. Some people find coconut oil helpful with brain problems. It is based on the principal of letting the brain burn fat instead of sugar. Sugar is very harmful for the brain. You might look at a Ketogenic diet. http://www.paleoplan.com/2012/05-30/ketogenic-diet-and-alzheimers-make-the-news/


 I have not been diagnose with Alzheimer's and doing everything I can not to have Alzheimer's. Try to limit the sugar and carbs as much as possible. Think diet is the big key.


 I am here to try and answer questions concerning health. I was so sick about 7 years ago that I wanted to die. I want to share the information I have obtained in getting my health back. I could not be diagnosed with any specific disease. My Primary Care Physician told me it was old age and I would have to learn to live with it. I had to search the internet to try and find the answer for my problem. Every disease I looked at seem to have diet as a key to healing. You are correct; diet should be common sense but if it was we would not have all the disease we have today. Hippocrates the father of western medicine told us ""Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food"". When you see all the food McDonald's is selling the word is not getting out. I have brother-in law with Alzheimer's. I mention to him about the coconut oil. He tried it for a while and decided it was not helping. He slept less meaning he was more alert but did not find it helpful. We had dinner one night with him and I noticed he was drinking diet Dr. Pepper(Aspartame). He had cake and pie for desert. According to the Ketogenic Diet you have to give up the sugar and simple carbs. Some people are not willing to do this but they should have the information so they can make it their decision. Coconut oil is not the magic ingredients it is only one thing which has shown a benefit in treating Alzheimer's. It is about everything we put in our mouth, inject in our bodies, put on our skin and breath. We live in a toxic world and in order for our bodies to deal with the toxins we need vitamins and minerals. That is how the body repairs itself. Best we get our vitamins and minerals from the raw fruits and vegetables. Did a lot of juicing when I was sick. Unfortunately people do not take diet seriously and it is the most important thing we can do to have good health."
Is there any link between Reynards disease and Alzheimers,"Hi All, My wife has been diagnosed with Alzheimers,she also has Reynards which restricts the blood supply to the extremities in cold conditions,she also feels dizzy if standing without moving for a few minutes,which I think is connected to Reynauds. Does anyone think that the blood supply to the brain could be restricted, causing the Alzhiemers or making it worse. Her mother died of Alzhiemers and her father I think had Reynards. Lauriet","Standing from a sitting position lowers the blood pressure which can cause dizziness. I have Raynaud's as well, no AD tho :) And the Bp drop is not associated with Raynaud's. What kind of medications is she on?


 If her bp is normal but if the dizziness continue you should let her doc know. They can perform various tests to find out why. Btw, there are two primary types of dementia. Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. If she has Alzheimer's, most likely her blood flow to the brain is not being restricted but if she has vascular then lack of blood flow can make dementia worse. Raynaud's Shouldn't affect a person with Vascular dementia as Raynaud's affects the fingers and toes.


 Hmm interesting. I wonder how long it would take for the younger cells to break down due to the aging organs. But if it could give you a few more years with your loved one suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia, it sounds great! :) Please keep us updated.


 I googled: Raynard's disease and Alzheimers and didn't find much.


 Hi, She`s on Memantine 10mg and 75mg of Asprin. Lauriet


 Hi, Thanks for the information I will make an appointment with her GP regarding the dizziness.As an aside, I have been in contact with The Stanford University in California and with the Manchester University in the UK were they are doing research into Alzheimer's. Basically they are transferring blood from young people under thirty years of age into people with dementia. The Stanford University people are doing human trials now and the results should be announced in the late summer. They have had good results using mice. Lauriet


 Hi, Will do. Lauriet"
"Won't get out of bed, hasn't eaten in 7 days",I would love to know if this is symptom before passing away. Anyone know? We are considering home hospice care.,"I'm not sure about the water. I'll check on that. I appreciate your feedback. We are looking into hospice care for her. She is in her early 60s and has had Alzheimer's for quite a few years now. She can't talk much. Tries but can't formulate words.


 It would help if you posted a lot more information. Not eating for seven days would be bad for anyone at any age. But from what I understand, a person can go weeks without food. Not drinking water for a weak would be much more dangerous.


 Sadly, yes these are signs that she has entered the end stages. Alzheimer's is such a cruel and unforgiving disease. :("
Namenda and not happy with the outcome,"Just started my mom on this drug,(Namenda). I'm not happy at all with the outcome so far. I'm thinking about taking her off before its too late. She is acting way way worse than before she started. I didn't think she had much wrong and then I took her to the Dr and he says shes Demented and puts her on this stuff. I know my mom pretty well and shes always been the way she is just a little worse with age. This stuff is making her like she has Dementia. I am curious if anyone else has had this problem. Please help....","Hello ...... My Mother was on Namenda for close to 2-years but was taken off of it shortly after going into a Home For Assisted Living - for Dimentia and Parkinsons. There explanation was ...... Namenda usually works well for people in the earliest stages of Dimentia - but not in the later stages. The explanation was by an RN that was on staff. Hope this is of some help. Rob and Gizzy


 My H was on Namenda along with the Excelon Patch for 7 yrs. I believe they have run their course and took him off at Thanksgiving. See no difference in personality/behaviors as a result; normal decline for the stage. He is middle stage of 6. Have appt with our neuro in 2 weeks.


 My mom has been on Namenda alone for 7 years now. He doctor thought it was useless by now so I should take her off. I started with decreasing the evening dose so by half. She couldn't get into a car or know what i want her to do so either the drug is working some or that she's addicted to it by now and going off just makes her worse. We seem to be stuck now.


 I hope not. I thought it's just Namenda but taken once a day. Aricept interfered with my mom's PD medication and she was very weak.


 Yes, they put my Mom on somthing similar -- it created delusional thoughts, crazy dreams. She was telling us that she had a bed mate, but she was okay with it and that she had bought a car for our Dad (he passed two years ago) and that she wasn't sure how to get it up to where she was in the mountains. So she went from living in the moment and forgetting things to downright delusional. We took her off it right away. And, as a side note, I wouldn't email the person in the other post, or even get the link. I think it's a spammer.


 My mom is on 10 mg of Namenda twice daily and Aricept 10 mg in morning and 5 mg at bedtime. It was my understanding that the Aricept is earlier in treatment and Namenda is for more severe dementia; but .. together they work as a combined therapeutic dose for dementia if caught early enough. It actually has been helping my mother. Before she was put on it, she was asking the same questions over and over again in a very short period of time and wasn't able to retain anything. That was two years ago. Now, her dementia was really better than it was two years ago. Unfortunately, my father's passing in January, is causing more stress and her symptoms are worse. We hope this is temporarily.


 I was told the same thing about Namenda & Aricept working hand in hand. My partner has been on them for about 5 months now but I see no change. I belong to a support group that I go to at the Cleveland Clinic, here in Vegas, and was told 2 weeks ago that Forest Labs will not be making Namenda in 5 or 10 mg anymore after 8-14-14. I will be asking the Dr. about this when we go in June. There could possibly be a replacement or they will make it in a different dosage.


 To my understanding, they are going to combine the Namenda & Aricept in one pill and it will be taken once daily. They are calling it Namenda XR. For more you can go to: http://www.namendaxr.com/


 I mis-spoke. Thee Namenda & Aricept are not going to be combined. (This is according to our ""brain specialist"" at the Cleveland Clinic. We will now be taking the Namenda once a day & he upped the Aricept to 15 MG a day."
Alzheimer's and my Dad,"All I can say is that this disease SUC*#! I lost my dad on 5/8/14. Memorial Service coming up on 5/17/14. I'm sorry to all of you who are having to deal with this dreaded disease. By the way, I'm a newbie. God Bless, Mike","So sorry to hear that. Hope you pull through this soon. God bless!


 Hello Xdarata, and welcome to HW. This disease is very frightening, but from what you wrote, you haven't been dx w/ Alzheimer's. Is that right? I think most of us forget things on a very regular basis. It can be due to stress or such. It happens the older we get, too. I have what is lovingly called, 'Fibro Fog'. There are times I can't remember how to add a group of numbers or how to spell a simple word I know, etc. I was a teacher for many yrs., so you can imagine how unnerving that was in a classroom. If you have concerns about your memory, I would suggest you discuss this w/ your dr. S/he may send you to a neurologist or such to have testing done. My DM had the testing done yrs ago. She did have this DD. At this point in time, I do not. Your dr may be able to give you some peace of mind. Pls let us know how you're doing? God bless. Alice.


 Hello Mike, I'm very sorry to hear of the loss of your DF. I wholly agree w/ you re this disease. Your DF is at peace now, pls take care of you at this very emotionally draining time. Welcome to HW, just wish it was for another reason. My prayers are w/ you and your family. God bless. Alice.


 I sometimes feel very scared with this disease. Because, sometimes I forget about something. I'm afraid it is a symptom of Alzheimer's. However, I hope that's not it."
Traveling with Alzheimer’s Disease,"My mom has AD - middle stage. She has it combined with vascular dementia. At times she is ""fine"" relatively speaking but at other times she is completely lost and confused. One thing that she keeps on mentioning no matter what stage she is in is her desire to travel once more to see the Redwood trees in Sequoia. We used to live in California and visit Sequoia every year during school vacation. my mom is 88 years old and we now live a 15 hour flight away from California. I'm afraid that if i don't grant my mom this wish of seeing the Redwood trees once more it will be on my conscience for the rest of my life - that i didn't do it or didn't do enough for her. i realize that she will probably not remember being there a short time later but... How dangerous is it to fly with her for 15 straight hours? will this confuse her even more? should i just ignore this request and not feel guilty about it. Apart from the AD she is in good physical health for her age. i would appreciate hearing from someone that has experienced travelling with an AD patient.","I agree with Steve. I know my dad, even when we'd take him to where he wanted to go, would be ready to leave as soon as we got there. Easy when it's 30 minutes away. You might be able to find an HD video of the PBS type about the trees and parks that could be watched and enjoyed a little closer to home. I can't travel due to my own medical reasons and I enjoy watching these types of shows, especially the fly-over shots they take. We probably all have regrets, but keep in mind that she did get to enjoy these things at one point in her life. Those memories, though they may be fading for her now, are good memories. A trip that would be hard on a healthier person would probably not evoke the same feelings.


 Tough call.. Does she get unruly or combative? Being stuck on a plane with no where to go could be painful for everyone... Then there's the trip back. Could maybe put together a slide show or power point of Sequoia."
Mom hates the nursing home,"Hi 73Monte, welcome to the Alzheimers site! I too post on another forum, but since my Mom has Dementia, I also frequent this site. I'm not sure how long your Mom has been in the facility. Is it a nursing home or a memory care? Does she have her own room? We had in home care for my parents, and after my Dad died we continued with 24 hour care for my Mom. It's not cheap, but it can be done. There are other options as well; if she likes to be around other people, you could have her go to and Adult Day Care Center a couple of days a week. These centers are fabulous -- the folks get stimulation from others, plus the activities they do. We did end up with my Mom in a Memory Care Center -- we didn't know how she would do because she is such a little and quiet person. She's gained ten pounds and enjoys her ""place."" It's only about a 45 person center, but it's like a big house and the care there is fabulous. She gets regular meals and takes her meds on queue, plus she is always involved in activities. She closer to my other three siblings, but a lot further from me...and they take great care of her. I hope you and your Mom find some peace. It's so hard and yes, we all have the guilty feelings of not thinking we are doing the best for these fine people; but sometimes I think if we are feeling that way that we must be doing the best that we can -- because if we weren't we wouldn't care. Make sense or not? Carol","Thanks Gizzy/Lonie for your replies, My Mom is in a Nursing home, and she does have her own room. I've had her in an adult day programme for the last couple of years when she was still residing at home. I don't have any other experiences with Nursing homes. We selected this one because my Brother's Mother-in-law is in there, and it's also only a block from my house. It's only been a week, but I just don't like what I'm seeing right now. My Brother doesn't share my view at all, and is quite content to leave her there. He doesn't want me visiting her for at least 6 weeks, to give her time to adapt. I just can't conform to that, as I already feel like I've abandoned her. Also, I've been the one taking care of her for the last 3 years. My two Brother's have wanted nothing to do with her over that time, outside of her Birthday and Christmas. I understand that this is quite common, and have heard from many others that have similar circumstances. What bothers me the most is, if I had of just taken a tour there before agreeing to put my Mom in there, I would of said no way. Now I feel like I have to give it a chance. In the meantime, I'm going to start looking at some other homes to see how they compare.


 To 73monte ... The term nursing home seems to often get used to describe different types of facilities. The definition given to me when I was searching 11-months ago was ... a nursing home was a facility where State licensing existed to allow for an IV to be placed and monitored on a patient. It does imply, at least in Illinois, that a Nursing Home is qualified to perform some of the more rudimentory actions by the nurse or the staff that a hospital might normally perform. The other types of living environments are not allowed that degree of medical support or interactions - at least, in this State. I would guess that this changes by the State, and the available patient programs (to keep their minds stimulated) probably change from location to location. Please do give your Mothers facility some time ... ask plenty of questions when you do go ... and quietly observe how everyone is treated when you're there. As far as frequency of going there, I can't play amateur psycologist here. But personally, I don't think allowing 6-weeks or whatever timeframe seems right to stay away initially is right. I think in order for a patient to feel comfortable in new surroundings, there does need to be a certain amount of ""doing it on her own""! But ... there also needs to be a certain amount of ""love from home"" on a regular basis. You don't want her to feel like she was abandoned. From the first week, my Mother went into her Home - last September - I have been there every week, but just once a week. My daughter has come with me 4 or 5 of those times. My dog has come with me 4 or 5 of those times. Yep ... they believe in that ... where she lives! And my daughter told me, on Mothers Day when all three of us visited, ""Grandma seemed to be happiest to see Gizmo""! Take a little time. Don't beat yourself up for putting her in there - either so soon or without checking more places out first. It is a difficult decision ... and feedback from Mom might not be so accurate so soon. Best wishes ...... anbd peace to you and yours.


 To 73monte ... ""Nothing to do all day"" is not a good thing. Is there a Social Director or similar position there - a person who you could ask to describe what is typically planned for a day? A large activity schedule of available things to do - is so important for a dementia patient. Many patients might not want to do much (in terms of activities) - and it shouldn't be forced, but it should be available. I have watched Mom (along with others) play Bingo - but the bingo game was set up with pictures of seasonal things - rather than numbers. I saw how difficult it was, at times, for Mom (and others) to identify a picture of a blouse (for example) after the word ""blouse"" was called out. Compared to playing by the traditional bingo numbers, it was sometimes difficult ... but it made each of the patients ""think""!!! And that was the idea - to present small challenges to the mind. By the way, my Mother still does complain every other visit or so, that she wants to go home - or how much longer will she have to be there ... and that's after being there for over 10-months now. But, when I watch her playing bingo, or sitting thru an Elvis impersonator, or singing along with an entertainer - she is having a good time, and doing some things that would not be possible if she was home alone - or with a caregiver. It's bad enough for a person to be displaced (if you will) and away from all familiar things ... and it's even worse when dementia is a part of it. I remember some of my Mothers first symtoms of dementia (although I didn't know it at the time) - of distrust! And, I think, when you picture someone with distrust issues - then going into a strange place, it could be very scary, or at least uncomfortable for that peraon. I hope the Nursing home your Mother is in does have a program of some things daily to challenge her mind. I think it's so important for the mind to be challenged to an extent - to be kept busy - I guess! Wishing you and yours well.


 I talk to my mom every evening and every evening she tells me ""it's been a long, nothing day."" First rule, do NOT believe what a person with dementia is telling you. Where my mom lives, they have activities all day long and early evening. My mom's days may be long and nothing but it is because she refuses to participate. Residents canNOT be forced to do anything, they have rights. Same with showers. As disgusting as this may sound, my mom has not had a shower now for FIVE WEEKS. Thankfully, they are able to get her to wash up at the sink in the morning, they call it PTA (Pits, t**s, and a**)...I was horrified at first but now I realize there is only so much one can do. I truly believe my mom's refusal of medications and showers is her fight to have some control of her life. Those are the only two things left she can control. She was always very independent, VERY stubborn. By the way, the place where she is living, it is skilled nursing care, rated 5 star, highest rating and considered once of the best in this area. The head nurse has worked on her floor for 23 years and tells me all the time how much she loves her job. For the life of me, I have no idea how she can handle it. I get off the elevator, look around and immediately get depressed


 Have you looked into residential care homes? Sometimes those are more ""homey"" and have a less institutional setting because they are an actual home. They are equipped for elderly needs and have about 6-10 people at the most per home. She might be more comfortable in a smaller place like that.


 Yes, that's about the cost here in the US for either retirement or care homes...and in home care is even more expensive. It's tough because there are not a lot of affordable options for our elderly. I think our age group is really the first to run into these issues because people are living so much longer. That's the good thing about having a support forum. In regard to the inhouse caregiving -- I think it's a roll of the dice. My parents had some fabulous women come in, and then the next day, someone else that I had to keep my eye on. It's a tough thing. Is the govt program the one that hires the staff, or do you have a say?


 Lonie, My mom does NOT wear adult underwear, she is continent. Amazing that she is, because it seems she has lost her mind, seriously. She has been on Namenda and Aricept, two dementia meds for ten years now and I think what has happened is that they simply stopped working. Either that, or because of her refusal to take her meds, well, if she doesn't take them, they can't be working. It's such a frustrating situation. My sisters and I were told when we placed mom and they interviewed and assessed her and put her on the Alzheimer's/dementia floor, the ""locked floor"" even though she does not wander, we were told she needed to be there because of the specialized care. And yet they are not able to take care of her. Why? She refuses. Before it was a game with her. She would negotiate with them, with her meds, she would say ""you take half and I'll take half""...eventually she would take them. Now, she purses her lips shut tight and swings her head back and forth. If the persist, she starts swinging, trying to hit them, calling them some really horrible names. My mother NEVER used foul language, never. I can't believe what is coming out of her mouth now. And the refusal to shower. How disgusting is that? And again, it's not that the staff doesn't try. They try to make a game of it. She loves to get a back massage, loves to get her back scratched, they do all this while taking her to the spa room and once she is there, she fights them and screams and carries on so much, they have to stop. My mother is a holocaust survivor, so there may be some issues going on here that have to do with the showers. We simply do not know. As much as she has lost, she is still continent...amazing and thank goodness. She does still recognize me and my sisters, but at times does not know who we are. Honestly, as horrible as this sounds, I see no quality of life. And the cost? $9,600 a month. They are all private rooms with a bathroom, but no shower in the room. As I have mentioned, mom is public aid pending and they are only taking her social security check and allowing her to live there while we wait to see if she is accepted on public aid. It is a nightmare and has made a mess out of me. I am seeing a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety. All the phone calls I receive from the nurses, the doctors, the administration, certified letters to sign off on correspondence, and then having to explain everything to my sisters, who are not even on the same page with me. I feel as if I am losing my mind. And the calls from mom. She is able to call, we have a phone that we can program our numbers into so all she does is push a button that has our photo on it. She calls me at least 6 times a day telling me how lonely she is and yet when people try to spend time with her, she screams at them and throws them out of her room. Yes, I visit with her, but I cannot continue to go as often as I have been. It's tearing me apart. I truly understand now why they say Alzheimer's is so hard on the family, not necessarily the patient. My mom has no idea what is going on, from one minute to the next. All I want for her is to be safe and not suffer, that is all.


 To 73monte ... Going back to your original thread posting - you might consider putting her back into her own home with 24/7 care - but, be careful! My Mother's experience with an in-home caregiver was really pretty good, but there were a few times when Mom's temper pushed the caregiver to her limits. Actually, in 15-months her week-end caregiver was changed 3 times. Her weekday caregiver stayed the entire 15-months. Some of it was caregiver patience level - and some of it was caregiver experience with dementia. As long as your Mom's doctor hasn't said she needs medical care - like that of an RN, it would seem you have the choice or option. While the home is of course more comfortable, I've been told that dementia patients can become much more bossy - being that it's their own home - and why should they listen to some stranger in their own home. And many of the dementia programed assisted living or nursing homes have so many things for their patients to do. Yep ...most will resist. And nearly all want to go back home ... but, does a dementia patient know what's best for her or him? My Mother has been in her Assisted Living home for dementia for over 10-months now. It has been a few months since she has said ""will she ever go home again""! It is a dificult situation to ""watch"" ... but again, what is really for her best interests! Strength to you and yours.


 Thanks for all the replies, (again). All of you have made some very good suggestions. I've come to the conclusion that the best possible solution for my Mom would be a retirement home that offers assisted living. There's only one in my area, and I've set up an appt. to visit next week. If this doesn't pan out, then I'm at a total loss, and will likely have to keep in the nursing home that she's currently at. I did visit one other, but while it was a 5 star facility, it was just too independent for my Mom. The actiivities were great, the staff was excellent, the food and apartments were unbelievable. But they just didn't offer enough assistance. Tom.


 Dear Franklen, You are a SAINT. My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's ten years' ago. I took mom into my home for the first year. I was working full time and had a caregiver in the home with mom. Mom was pretty independent but because of her memory issues and confusion, she just could not be left alone. She HATED that I had someone here to ""babysit"" her. She tormented this poor woman, a true angel, what a love. When I was home, I was with mom. I do not know what your father is like, but my mom would continuously repeat things, over and over and yes, I truly understand it is the disease, NOT her fault, but I could only listen to it so long. I thought I was going to go mad. I became horribly depressed. I have two sisters that did help, but didn't understand how much I needed them. They would pick up mom for two hours on a weekend and then bring her back. I must say I agree with you about the nursing homes, but for some that is the only answer. My mom's journey continues. We just moved her into a skilled nursing facility, about four months' ago and boy did that confuse her. It is the change that causes such confusion. Had your father stayed longer, he would have settled in. We had to move her to another room, for her safety, because she falls so often, they wanted her nearer to the nurse's station and so again we went through ten days of hell, well she did and she took us with her. Alzheimer's is a horrible, horrible disease. The only saving grace is that the patient doesn't remember. My mother has no short term memory, none. But, she remember her three daughters, probably because we are there so often. We make it our business to visit her often, so the staff are very aware family is involved and watching. I also attend family council meetings once a month at the facility. I must say I admire you so much, to have such love for your family, and patience. You are a very rare gem indeed. Miriam


 Hello ..... Regarding the choice ... sometimes there is no choice! In my case, my Mother 2-1/2 years ago was rushed to the hospital after a fall in her home. Her neighbor was the first to find her, after my call to Mom went unanswered. I live 20-miles away and have had major meical problems myself, but have been calling my Mother every day at 5pm or so ... since my Father died 18-years ago. When she didn't answer, I called her neighbor ... then met them both at the hospital ER. When Mom was released, the doctor said ""she cannot go home unless she has a 24/7 licensed caregiver staying with her""! And I have a 2-story townhouse with both bedrooms on the second floor. Mom's house is a one-story two bedroom house - not to mention that she was not going to leave her house of almost 60-years. Of course, Mom could not climb stairs either! Then, last August, the dementia progresses to a point of her becoming hysterical at times late at night. She was brought into the hospital, and had close to 30-days of observation. When she was released last Septmeber, the doctors order were ""she cannot go back home under the care of her caregivers - she needs to be under the care of a licensed nurse""! So ... that is what choice there was!!! Only ... which institution!!!! Incidentally, while I was in to see my Psychologist for terminal diseases last Saturday, he did say there is a big difference between alzheimers and dementia. I will be seeing that doctor again this Saturday, and will get a detailed definition of the differences. I will post what he has to say!


 I'm new here, but not to HW. I'm guessing this has been posted hundreds of times over. We just admitted my Mom to a nursing home. She's had advancing dimentia for the last couple of years, but it seemed to jump into a higher gear recently after a lung infection. So far she absolutely hates it there, and has been crying every night, begging to go back to her home. Did I make a mistake? I'm now considering live-in care in her home. Is this a good idea? My Mom isn't violent of a wanderer. She just doesn't want to be institionalized. She's willing to go back to her home with a live-in companion. Thanks in adavance for any advice. Right now I'm just consumed with guilt and sorrow.


 Hello 73monte ... I too, first came to HW because of another illness (and of mine) - but have gotten somewhat involved with this illness - because of my Mother. My Mother did have a 24/7 live-in caregiver for 15-months after leaving the hospital in May of 2011. It worked well mostly because Mom was at home - and she felt there was someone there helping her all of the time. While it was a comfort to her, as her dementia progressed, she began having occassional episodes late at night - thinking someone was in her house trying to kill her. The last episode like that was pretty bad, and her primary doctor wanted her to be checked into the local hospital - into what I would call the psychiatric ward. Tht was in August of 2012. Before being released, the psychiatrist and her primary both stated they would not allow her to go back home - even under the care of the caregiver she had had for 15-months. So ... it was a forced move by the doctors, for her to go into a facility with 24/7 registered nurse care. She has been at that facility since September of 2012 now. The positives of a facility like she is in ..... they do take memory care very seriously. I have many times watched the games that they play that are intended to stimulate the mind - to keep it active. Games that could not have the same affect if she were in her home with a caregiver. I have watched the degree of respect given to the patients there - by the caregivers and the nurse too. And when she falls, as she does from time to time, there is a registered nurse there on staff - who always calls me - and lets me know if the doctor needs to be called, and what they've done in the meantime. Again, this is care she would not be able to get at home with a caregiver. This memory care center is set up into 4 small buildings with a home-like atmosphere. Each building holds a maximum of about 18-patients, and each building has at least one house pet (typically a dog) - for the animal therapy benefits. Entertainment comes in about once a week - and it's usually a singer who also plays an instrument, and who gets the patients involved within their performances. And the facility does everything they can to discourage a patient from spending much time in their own room ... activities or group activities are highly encouraged. And even though my Mother was mostly a loner in her life, she does love the bingo games, the nail polishing parties, the entertainment in the Great Room and the occassional talking to an animal. The cost ... about the same as her living at home with a 24/7 caregiver. Actually when her old home closes (in a sale) in two weeks (it's been vacant for over 10-months now) ... it will be slightly less costly for her to be in her Memory Care Center - than living at home with the caregiver. In summary ... for my Mother , it wasn't a choice to leave her home. It was a doctor's order. The term ""nursing home"" can mean a lot of things! I went thru one close to a year ago when I was searching, and it was appalling - but, of course, they are not all the same. Where she ended up going was to an Assisted Living Home for Dementia and Parkinsins. And ... if you had feelings of guilt, they are misplaced! If you were guilty of something not nice, you would not be writing about your concerns for your Mother. Wishing you well ..........!


 73Monte--that's a great idea! Do a comparative and see if there is a place that might suit her and you better. Sounds like you are the one that might make the best decision. Show up unexpectly to see how things are running. I can tell you that my sister's and brother are visiting with my Mom all the time and the staff knows it! I've hear people leaving them for six weeks to get acclamated, but I'm not sure we could have done that either. I will admit that the first few months were really tough, and she'd call my sisters in the middle of the night or every five minutes during the day because she wasn't sure where she was. It was stressful, but I swear to you that she is way happier being where she is.


 Thanks again guys for the advice. I went to visit my Mom tonight, and she's still wanting out of there of course. I asked her if she's had a bath/shower yet, and she said no. The Nurse checked the log, and said that my Mom's refused them. She said that they can't force them and sometimes they've had residents not shower for months. It seems evertime I visit, there's more things that I wasn't aware of. I will continue to give it a chance, but she's complaining so much about there being nothing to do all day, and no one to talk to. While my Mom has dimentia, and very poor short term memory issues, she's leaps and bounds ahead of most of the residents there.


 I agree with Gizzy -- nothing to do all day is not a good thing. My Mom doesn't remember what she does, and at first was hesitant to do anything. The caregivers were very persistant and finally she started doing activities -- she never remembers what she does, but my sister's tell me. There is also a big board in the reception area to alert family members what is going on for the month. They make a big deal out of birthdays, and they have an ice cream social every Saturday from 1-2:00. If you do happen to go visit other facilities, ask them about their bathing policies. Not ""forcing"" them to bathe is a nice gesture...but I think unsanitary and if she is wearing adult underwear...that could become a problem. Also, do they have a central dining area? That's a good way to keep her socialized. Thanks for keeping us updated!


 Thanks again for the supportive replies. MT lady: I understand the ""force"" issue. I wouldn't be able to watch my Mother not be bathed for 5 weeks though. Don't get me wrong, not being judgemental. You might be right in the descript ion of things. Maybe she just can't remember what the daily going ons were. I still think that if it were such a great place to spend the final years of your life, there should at least be some contentment. My Mother tells me daily that she simply hates it there, and wants to get out. She cries when I leave almost daily. I don't see it changing. I know that I would hate it there too. I wish there were some alternative to keeping her there. She seems too far gone for a retirement setting, and not far gone enough for full blown nursing care.


 Lonie, I'm in Canada, so I'm not sure what they're called here. We do have one home like that in proximity to me. It does sound like a better alternative, but the problem is they're extremely expensive here. $5000 per month or more. I'm now going to visit two retirement homes this week. One that offers assisted living. If that doesn't pan out, I'm going to look at taking her back to her home with a live-in care worker. There's a governement sponsored programme for it. It's still not cheap but it's the only other option on the table. This too presents problems, as they are all newly emmigrated, mostly from the Phillipines. You sort of have to hope that you get someone that's a good fit, reliable, trustworthy etc. I have seen some very good ones that work well, and also some that end very badly.


 To 73monte ...... I just closed on the sale of my Mother's home last Friday, and even though the 6-year old recession still has housing values down, it was a comfort to have a cushion for Mom in the bank for the next 2 to 3-years or more. In the midwest of the U.S. it seems that it is pretty much of a wash in cost comparisions between having a 24/7 caregiver staying in the home with Mom vs. Mom being in most homes with a roomate pairing. My Mother had 15-months of living at home with a 24/7 caregiver, and the costs were about $5000./month + the cost of operating the house itself (tax, utilities, insurance, food) + the costs of medical insurance, deductibles and medications. When all of those are added, the total cost was about $7500./month and her combined SS and pension added up to just over $2000./month ... so the lifetime savings go in a hurry! In April of 2011, my Mother went into the hospital after falling at home - and not being able to get up. After observation, it was determined that she had dementia - and the doctor would not allow her to go back home alone. She needed to have a 24/7 caregiver. I found a group that was very experienced with dementia patients, and it worked well for over a year. However, in August of 2012, my Mother was admitted into the hospital for observation and testing - after having seriously bad dreams and hallucinations. Before being released, the doctor then said she needed to be in an invironment that had trained nurses ... she was at that stage now. So ... since September of 2012, she has been in an Assisted Living Home for Dementia and Parkinsons Patients. There is a registered nurse on staff 24/7, they have great programs to stimulate the mind, the surroundings are much more like an large home than an institution. The caregivers there, even after over 40 visits of mine, are always patient and gentle ... no signs of being treated badly! I had looked at about 6 different places last August, and they varied in price from a little over $5000. to just under $7000./month. Her's is at $6000./month and includes nearly everything. The only extras I have seen billed have been for the in-house beauty shop and for occassional group excursions - both optional. Now, since her old home is sold, her total costs of everything are about $6500./month including insurance and medication ... or $1000. less than it cost when she lived at home. Yes ... it is expensive either way, but the level of care is greater at the Assisted Living Home.


 Oh Mt Lady, I hear you. It's so not easy on the caregivers, and I'm sorry that she is so defiant. I think it must have something to do with her being a holocaust survivor. Interestingly enough, we know my Mom and her sister were seriously abused by their alcoholic father. When I tell my Mom I love her, she says thank you. Never has said I love you back. She is one of the sweetest ladies, but I just find that interesting. I feel for you, and glad you are getting some help to get you through these tough days. I can't say I've ever had it as difficult; maybe when my Dad was so sick and I was the only one in the area to take care of both of them. Caregiver calls, appts., and trying to get both of them out of cars and one in a wheelchair, the other a wanderer. Yes, it was stressful. Nothing like what you are dealing with though. Hugs.


 Why don't you go or call DHS and ask for an elderly intake worker? It is expensive for home care when you pay out of the pocket. However, I personally only paid $100 a month through DHS. DHS covered the rest of the income. I qualified (as I was her caretaker) for 4 days off a month. Also, think like a baby when it comes to home care (not that she one!). The house needs well basically child proofed - especially doors so they don't escape. You can get door alarms fairly inexpensive, as well as those you know child knobs. At home, you are looking just like a facility, your mother will need 24 hour care 7 days a week. As for the showers, sometimes people with dementia become afraid of water shall we say. My mil was more of a bath person so I'd put a fav show of hers on and draw the bath while she watched her show. I'd say something like ""Oh Gma it looks like your bath is ready"" or ""you might want to get in the tub while the water is still warm"". I would basically act like she drew the bath so she thought it was her idea. Also, my Gma was very independent. So you must think dignity too. She probably isn't used to the idea of someone helping her bathe, yet that is what they do at facilities. I'd stay right outside of the restroom so if anything happened to Gma I had a fast response time. As far as what is best for your mother? None of us can decide that, we aren't there to see the situation, and we are not you. Also medical insurances (Medicaid and medicare too) will help in costs for home care and facility care too. I would suggest research first, see what it would intel for you, how much it would cost, how much insurance and funding would pay, how much you would have to pay out of pocket, so on. Basically, I am suggesting to make an educated decision to see what is best.


 73monte, Perhaps I missed the post, but I don't seem to see anyone suggesting that either family members live with her or that she live with family members. The way its done in most of the world. All I keep seeing is this institution or that institution or hiring this person or that person to come in at $5,000 per month and then not even being able to trust them or keep them on the job. As a alternative to $5,000 a month, why can you or a shared group of the family or even one individual stay with her in her own home, or have her in their home? Yes, I did that with a father who went through the full progression of Alzheimers so I'm not suggesting something without experience. Years later, my sister did a shorter version with my mother who only had mild dementia associated with being 96 to 97 during her last year. I might add, that during the time I cared for my father, he once broke his hip. After surgery, the routine calls for 2 weeks in a nursing home. I would visit him ever day for 8 hours because without that he wouldn't get proper care. Finally when his doctor visited him one Monday, he called me shortly after and told me I must take my father home a week early or he was afraid he'd totally lose contact with reality and flip out.... go permanently crazy. So that same day a ambulance brought him home one week early. Very difficult but it was the only way to keep him sane. I don't care what anyone says, activities or no activities, many Alzheimers patients do not do well in these care homes. Only a portion of the patients can or want to join in the activities. The others just sit alone in their chairs or rooms. Eventually they lose touch with reality and family and begin to flip out. Then they are usually placed on drugs so they won't be agitated or a problem for the staff. From then on they are barely alive. I just wanted to keep that at home with family as choice. Its not a easy choice. I understand that. It seldom is a more expensive choice if the family member doing it is treated fairly. Between her retirement income and the value of the house, money doesn't sound like the key issue. Obviously it helps if all family members are involved but it can be done by 1 or perhaps 2. Her wanting to go home, begging to go home, is only natural. People with Alzheimers are without a framework when they don't have familiar surroundings. Everything is new and different, different and with shifting helpers, its like being in a nightmare you can't figure out and can't wake up from. My fathers one week in a nursing home, after hip surgery was like a nightmare. The doctor was right, he was on the verge of completely losing his mind if I didn't take him home. Just my perspective. I feel for these old people with Alzheimers. Families can often do more than they think though it often involves sacrifice and inconvenience to one's previous routines.


 I know exactly how all of you feel. My dad had alzheimers and went through all the stages within a year. The day he passed away he was suppose to go into a nursing home. I truly believe that he did not want to go into one. My mum who did not have alzheimers decided to go into a retirement home in north Toronto. It was the worst thing we coud have done. My prayers are with all of you.


 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do what makes your mom happy. Imagine this to be your life in 20 years and you are in the receiving end of this. What would you want?"
Sister  diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease,"Hi, I'm new to this, my sister has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, recently, they say she is four years in, and it seems like the middle stage. She is 56. She is fighting it and very aggressive about it , if her husband tries to talk to her about it, she doesn't believe that she has it. She has threatened to leave him, if he continues to talk about it. He just wanted to get a companion for her, while he was at work, and asked her was she willing to take the medication, which might help. She has refused everything, it is a very difficult situation, she doesn't know I know her diagnosis, she didn't want anybody to know. She needs help, I don't know where to go from here, Regards, Collie Edit: I gave your thread a title. Post Edited By Moderator (stkitt) : 3/23/2014 9:03:20 AM (GMT-6)","Thank you for your great suggestions, it is so hard to believe at the moment, even talking to her, you are wishing it away. It is so hard to contemplate the future for her.


 I also have been wondering how quickly it progresses. My sister is early on set, and some research states that this can progress more quickly. It's hard to think about it, I have to keep in my head, if I go with my emotions, it is too overwhelming to think about the enormity of it, I just feel so sad for my sister but I am trying to do positive things to help her, and to make the most of good quality time we have left


 Hi Michelle, I just checked my emails, so apologises for not replying sooner. Yes I can recognise alot of my sister's behaviour in your sister. The consultant says by her scans that she is four years into the disease and she has never talked to us about it. Her husband didn't tell us until recently because she didn't want us to know. That was such a pity because she had stopped ringing us and we will never get back that time, had we known the reason we would'nt have allowed her to isolate herself. Isolation I think, is a killer in this disease, as not having the stimulation progresses it far more rapaidly. Like you I am trying to pop in whenever I can without it being too obvious. I call her regularly now, as she would never call, it's not that she would'nt want to, but she would'nt remember to do it. My focus now is to give her happy times, as we don't know how fast it will progress. I'm going to be with her as much as I can, and give her good memories. I can't think about the future, we are in the present and that is the only thing we can change. It is overwhelming, and sometines I get really sad and have a little cry and that helps me a little bit I think. My sister is a very different person now, but unfotunately that is the reality and we have to accept it and support her anyway we can. I'd love it to be, not true, to wake up and realize it was just a nightmare, but that's not going to happen. I hope this helps a little, take care, Colette


 I have a strong history of dementia in my family. Just out of curiosity, what symptoms is your sister displaying and how do they know that she is four years into the disease? Having worked in nursing facilities for many years, it does seem like the early onset AD tends to be more severe. Thoughts and Prayers. Mame


 Permfindia... It is against the forum rules for anyone to sell anything on this site.


 Hello ...... Denial ......... it's so common! My Grandmother had diagnosed alzheimers and died of it over 20-years ago. My Mother just passed two months ago - but at the age of 96 - of Dementia. Even in the last year, she would refuse to believe that she had any kind of a mind destroying disease. I'm afraid there may be many heart-breaking years ahead ... without sugar-coating anything. Decisions at times, will need to be made that will likely be aggressively fought by your sister. They are for her own well being - but she will not likely see it that way. My suggestion would be to find and then talk to a counselor who specializes in advising families of dementia or alzheimers patients. It would be best to keep the negatives to a minimum ... but again, she may consider any kind of help as a negative. This disease is absolutely not fair - in any way! It tends to hurt everyone involved - and eventually hurts the survivors even more. Medication during the earlier stages can be helpful ... and a companion during the day is a great idea. See if you can find either a Sociologist or a Psychologist experienced in this disease - for his/her input ... and who might even be able to talk to your sister. If it comes from an authority figure - and a person she does not know, she may take it more seriously. If she gets upset, most of that might be aimed at the stranger rather than a family member. My best wishes to you. Rob & Gizmo


 I have been wondering how aggressive and quickly it goes. My mother in-law is aware that she is at the beginning. So my husband and his siblings are trying to get things straight. She is also a cancer survivor. One year so far ,but she is very frail and we live about 60 minutes away. Just trying to learn from everyone. I have be on this site for 9 years . Since being diagnosed with End Stage Liver disease, cirrhosis , osteoporosis, degenerative disk disease, fibromyalgia ,knee problems.And who knows what else.


 Hello, I too have a sister that was diagnosed at 59 with Alzheimer's. She is now 64 and well into the disease. It has taken her until recently to accept (if you can call it that) the disease. She flips back and forth from being extremely depressed, crying all the time and being mildly happy (or puts on her game face for us). She is trying to isolate herself now but refusing to go places with us. Sometimes I just show up at her home and that works but not always. I want to help her any way I can. Any suggestions? Thank you, Michelle


 Thank you Collette. I appreciate your support. I'll post any new ideas that work and would be glad to hear yours too. They may not work each time but then I'll just try something else. Thanks again. Michelle


 Hello a lainne. This illness robs everyone of their dignity if not managed with professional help, has been my experience with this disease. It can be increasingly hard on family members and eventually takes a toll. After the diagnosis all the past questionable behaviors all fall into place.. Not so obvious at first until after the diagnosis. A visiting case worker, or psychologist or a visiting nurse assigned thru state programs & services available thru hospitals in UR area with a doctors referral can be a great help & relief to the family.Sometimes it's best to also find a attorney to that specializes in elder care. Check with ur insurance for coverage available for dementia care. My father lived with me for many years with dementia. Someone needed to be with him 24/7, especially living out in the country. We did have assistance programs available in our state. He is in a VA facility now at 96 & very Happy. We are lucky to still have him! He is a fearsly independent man. Educating the whole family on the pros & cons is very important to see the signs of denial & also proper care,exercise, nutrition & meds. Wonderful advice by all the well thought out comments above. It will all work out.... giving time for adjustment and organizing what's best for u and UR family. Good Luck Peace & Light"
Coming home for visits: Good idea or bad idea?,"My 76 year old father was diagnosed with vascular dementia and moderate Alzheimer’s earlier this year. He also started having small strokes. This diagnosis came after several episodes that eventually lead to him asking us to take him to the hospital in the middle of the night. The most dramatic episodes seemed to stem from when my mother got sick last winter. She had some fairly significant medical issues that forced her to spend a month in hospital. When she was in hospital the rate of decayed in my fathers conative functioning was very visible. It seemed that he had no idea where or how to start taking care of himself i.e. what to do with mail (bills), how to feed himself etc. He was always very capable around the house over the past couple of years had becoming increasing confused over simple things. He eventually starting leaving burners running on the stove, starting electrical/wiring projects and not knowing how to finish them (getting electrocuted), falling and hitting his head while walking the dog. Doing plumbing jobs and causing the house to flood etc. The medical issues with my mother seemed to push him right over the edge. He eventually hit someone with his car and lost his driver license. The person was ok (thank god) but immediately following that event my father sank rapidly. After a month in the hospital and family meetings we determined that my father needed to go into a care facility because my mother, although back home and partially recovered, does not have the ability to take care of him and her own issues as the same time. Now my father is in a care home and trying to adjust. It is only a couple of miles from home so it is easy for my two brothers, my mother and myself to visit. My sister lives about 30 miles always so it is a bit more difficult for her to visit. This brings me to the point of the story. Although we have all been dealing with this in our own way we are all, with the exception of my sister, in agreement that my father cannot come home. He is very likely to burn the house down or work with power tools and injury himself, fall down stairs etc. My sister has been taking it upon herself to visit the care home and take my father out which we do no have exception with. She has, however, been brining driving him by his house which has been causing us all a great deal of concern. He seems to now feel he is working towards coming home and it is causing him great distress in the home after one of these events. The next day there are several phone calls to my mother from him asking/pleading for her to come pick him up. He is packing all of his belongings and putting them by the door. To make matters worse my sister actually brought him home while my mother was out (without her blessing) and sat around the table for a chit chat. She feels he is entitled because it is his home. We have asked to stop making these decisions on her own (unilaterally) but she will not. She feels she somehow knows better and that is it good for him. In the interim my mother is working at getting the home ready for sale so she can move to some type of supportive living facility. Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? When, if ever, is it good to brining an Alzheimer’s patient to their old home for a visit that he can never really return to? How do we deal with our sister on this issue? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.","rmcpherson70 - thought I'd chime in since no else has.... I'm, very new to all this myself. My lil sis has been the primary caregiver... We brought in our older brother to help do his share... Since he lives a 1000 miles away, the best he can do is send money... But when him wanted to take control from afar - we offered to take pops to him... That shut him up a good bit. The kids have to be in agreement. Who ever does the most work/spends the most time should be the ""shot caller"" and the others back him or her up."
Upset about mother leaving,"""Thanks for the info. Were they placed in a medi-caid paid home? We can't afford the private facilities which is why I am very hesitant about the state run type. My mom is all I have. The thought of not being able to see her when I want and take care of her is killing me inside. She's very much like a child and gets scared very easily and always looks for me. I'm already getting upset just thinking about her leaving me."" Bella, In answer to your above question: They were in privately-owned nursing homes who accept Medicaid. I'm not even sure we have state-owned nursing homes here. All the ones we checked into in our area are owned by larger companies, but if you want to do business in this industry where we live, you would have to accept Medicaid patients or go out of business because even those who pay their way can quickly run out of money unless they are very wealthy. Most all of the patients in our area are on Medicaid, even in the nicer, newer places. My dad had some savings (he and Mother lived simply and scrimped) and we paid monthly for his room and board, which was over $4000.00 a month. Had he lived longer and the money spent down to where he had only $2000.00 left, he would have been changed over to Medicaid and his stay there paid through that. When we placed him, he was coming out of a hospital stay. The hospitals have personnel whose job it is to find a facility that can take the patient in cases like Daddy's. So that helped us, but the nursing home gave us the information and had all the paperwork we needed to get these things done. I would suggest calling your mother's doctor first for help. The local Department of Human Services would have information also. Some of these offices may or may not be as helpful as they could be. I had to change my mother's doctor at one point due to the ineptitude of his staff with stuff like this. But I also suggest getting on the phone and calling local nursing homes and ask for information about their facility, including whether they take Medicaid patients. One thing about it--these people know that most of us have never done all this before and in our experience, the nursing homes were happy to help. If they aren't, that's probably not the place you want for your mother anyway. It may seem strange in this day and time, but the place my dad was in can be accessed 24/7 and they told us we could come any time as they don't lock the doors (it's in a small town). Patients who are apt to walk off wear ankle bracelets that set an alarm off. That's what my dad had after he was moved to a regular floor from the Alzheimer's unit when he improved. In the Alzheimer's unit, the unit is locked down for patient safety, but we were always let in and could take Daddy out and walk around place or go sit on their large front porch, of course, in rocking chairs. The Alzheimer's unit, even when Daddy was put into a regular room, held a special place for Daddy and he would go visit the other patients even after he moved out of it. I guess I'm trying to say that there are places out there that are good places and want families to come and be involved. And the other patients looove it when someone comes and will visit with you too! I hope you can find that for your mom. Bless you. -Joy",Thank you for being to relate what i'm going through. My mom was always very needy. When I threatened to move out at 17 she panicked and freaked out. I was only kidding of course since I didn't even have a job but I knew then the extent of her lack of self reliance. She couldn't even eat by herself in public. She was that self conscious. Over the years we just became one. My sister and brothers moved out and I was her rock. I slowly noticed tremors from her fingers then legs. I never imagined it could progress to dementia and weakness of her legs where she can barely walk now and can't tell me a thing when she's not feeling well. Thinking back I was so naive. The neurologist said your mom has Parkinsons and my response was ok what does she need to take and we'll go get them. I didn't understand how bad it can get or what it can build up to. I am still in denial and don't want to think about this. I rather she died in her sleep than go to a home. At least then I wouldn't have to worry anymore. I need to stop writing now or else the anxiety will come back in full force. Thanks again.
"Father, caregiver stressed taking care of grandmother","I am unsure what to do, this may be long, but help would be much appreciated, I'm so worried. As for a backstory, I'm 17 years old, just graduated high school, my father is 44 years old, and my grandmother is 78 years old. My grandmother had a stroke about 6 years ago due to built up stress and lack of medicine because one of her sons passed away (she has two sons and a daughter, one died, my father is the other son) SO the son that passed away's kids were put under her custody and her new (adopted?) kids hounded her for money and called her every night begging for it, she ended up giving them money and not buying her medicine, getting stressed and stressed without medicine she finally had a stroke, and guess what, they don't even come see her or call her anymore. Ever since she had a stroke, she couldn't live on her own, she started living with her daughter (my aunt) for two months, and my aunt couldn't handle it she said, and WE (my father and I) took her in. My grandmother has been living with us for almost six years now. Things were fine the first four years, the past two, have been complete hell. The WORST part of it is, when she doesn't sleep. When she doesn't sleep, she gets SO confused, she keeps imagining my father as a child thinking he's going to school, asking where he is, forgetting where she's at, becoming spiteful and mean and argumentative when you try to tell her the truth. My father's name is Brandon, she always asks ""Where's Brandon?"" My dad will say ""right here, I'm Brandon"" then she replies ""No not you, little Brandon, the other one."" It drives him insane. Then she thinks my father is one of her brothers and accuses him of crazy things and even walks into his room at say 1-4 in the morning and wakes him up asking where little Brandon is and to take her back home (Even though she's been living here for 5 years) and when you tell her differently by telling the truth she calls you a liar and screams and cusses at you being completely rude and spiteful. I don't know if that's early or escalating signs of dementia or Alzheimer's or what.. But it's really draining us. I don't want my dad to keel over from all this stress or have a heart attack or something... My parents are divorced and he's all I got. Nobody in my Grandmother's family comes to check up on her or help with her bills or anything. She doesn't make enough money each month to go to a retirement home either, she makes about 800$ per month WITHOUT putting in the costs of her pills, diapers, food we buy her each week, AND NOW sleeping pills that rarely seem to work. If we don't give her sleeping pills things become complete hell and she gets confused and insane. Can anyone please give me advice what to do about all of this? It would be much appreciated.. I just miss my old grandma.. She's not herself.. far from it, especially when she doesn't sleep... Thank you anyone who attempts to help, thank you very much... Sorry it was so long..","Hey there, friend. Glad you've posted here to get some support and encouragement and so sorry you're going through all this at home. I've been there, it's really hard to see someone we love begin to fade and it sounds like this with your grandma. I've got to commend you for caring about your dad and how this is all affecting him. You are carrying a big burden for a 17 year old and I'm sending you a hug. There are really kind, free counselors at a family group, if you want the information. Also, I found a book that you and your dad might want to take a look at called ""Complete Guide to Caring for Aging Loved Ones"" which is probably at your library. Please keep us posted!

 The nighttime sleeping problems are called ""Sundowning"". You may want to Google it. It tends to occur as AD advances.


 That is so much to be on your shoulders. So sorry. My Dad had Alzheimers. He was a gentle man, who became violent and uncontrollable. Every nursing home we put him in, they kicked him out. Even though they claimed to have Alzheimer wing , they really weren't equipped. We finally got him into a Alzheimer only facility. They took his social security check, because my Mom & Dad had no money. It was 3 hrs away, but they treated him wonderful. I don't know what state you're from, but try & find a facility like that. Good Luck Post Edited (Mema sesond time around) : 7/2/2014 4:25:53 PM (GMT-6)


 I'm sorry I didn't address this. If you're in the US, your grandmother would qualify for Medicaid which would pay for her nursing home care and medications, hospitalizations, and doctor visits. Unless someone is fairly wealthy, they usually end up with Medicaid paying for their care eventually. Your father or a sibling needs to get your grandmother evaluated. Her doctor would be where to start this discussion of her care. The nursing home we chose explained all the financial ins and outs about Medicaid. Also if a patient is has been hospitalized, Medicare will pay for the first 20 days of nursing home care. In the state I live in, a patient does have to spend their own money down toward their care until they reach about $2000.00 before Medicaid kicks in. If your grandmother is already in a Medicaid program, all this about spending down doesn't apply. In my father's case, he had savings that he paid for his care with at about $4,000.00 a month. His Medicare still paid for his medications and hospitalizations. He still received his Social Security check during that time. We would have eventually exhausted all his savings except 2000.00 and then Medicaid would have kicked in and started paying for all those things. He still would have received a very small amount of money monthly for his personal use. During that time Daddy was paying for his care, he was allowed to spend down some of the money in other ways that wouldn't hurt his ability to qualify for Medicaid later on (he couldn't give it to his family for instance). He prepaid for his funeral. He was allowed to still own one automobile. There are things you can and cannot do when qualifying for Medicaid, but the financial office of the nursing home explained all that to us. We also hired a lawyer since Daddy stilled owned a home and property. Daddy passed away before he spent down everything so we never had to deal with Medicaid and he didn't have to sell property and such.


 I'm so sorry to hear that you and your father have to deal with such a difficult siutation. I can't even begin to imagine the stress you're both going through. I have no experience with this illness. I'm sure you will get responses from Healing Well but I would strongly advise you to post your message in alzconnected.com. CLICK ""From The Message Boards. CLICK ""Caregivers Forums"". Then post your message. You will get all the advise you need. It would also be beneficial if you mention the State you live in. Those who post frequently in the Caregivers Forums are going through what you're going through and understand this illness. The reality is that she needs professional care which means a Nursing Home which is covered by Medicaid. Good Luck.


 One, first off. Make sure someone reviews her meds and that is all okay. over/under medicated can cause all sorts of issues. If your grandpa or grandma was a veterans there is aid and attendance she may be able to apply for that would have with some home care costs. First thing is, don't try to correct her. With my dad I would make excuses, oh dad, you must be tired or have a lot on your mind. I am right here. Also, the county you live in may offer free respite care. They would come sit with your grandma. That would allow a break for your father or you.


 Hello ......... You and your Dad are both caring people. I have been down the road - at least to an extent - that your Dad is going down. I have an old thread posted here called ""What to do?"" It documents the last 7-months or so of my Mothers life while she was declining with Dementia. My family is/was very small - no brothers or sisters ... and I have cancer. So my help was limited to seeing her every week for the last 5-years or so - and paying her bills for close to that timeframe. But, her last years were in an excellent local Assisted Living Home for Dementia and Parkinsons. It was costly at about $6000. per month - but they were excellent. Nursing Homes - in my area were about $5000. per month and were not equipped well to handle Dementia or Alzheimers. And those that were approved for Medicaid were terrible places to send a loved one. Before the Assisted Living, she was at her own home but with a 24/7 caregiver. That too is expensive. The group we used was about $5000. per month and they were toward the lower end of pricing. She was fortunate to have savings that paid for the majority of those expenses for close to three years. Last Summer, as her savings were getting low, I put her house up for sale. It was sold and allowed her the available cash to live up to two more years in that Assisted Living Home. Everthing is so expensive - for most people. And Dementia patients need the type of care that often cannot be found in a Nursing Home. Finances are difficult ..... and the typical Dementia patient unknowingly makes demands upon their caregivers that sometimes are difficult to live with. I would highly suggest your Dad (and maybe you too) go to a counselor who works with caregivers. Both of you need re-assurance at times - and certainly need regular breaks. There are agencies of volunteers who may be able to help you with periodic breaks. You may find a support group for caregivers - and I would highly suggest that too. I did at one point, investigate government assistance - because my Father was in the armed forces. It is available for the spouse of a veteran - BUT .... only after the spouses total net worth is down to $30,000. including the value of a home. And then, the maximum I found was about $1000. per month ..... and you can't get into any kind of a retirement home for 3x that amount. So, that only helps if there is a big social security check and pension check coming in - besides the government assistance. It is a dismal financial situation. One other thought is hospice care. It is available thru medicare - at no cost to the patient. While it usually is short-term care - it is sometimes available for more han 6-months. It must be recommended by a doctor though. Note - all of the above financial info is based on living in the U.S.! I am so sorry both of you are going thru this ..... and realize it's doubley painful because you love grandma! Peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo


 Hi, Bless you and your dad. I'm popping over from the Crohn's forum, but my father had Alzheimer's and my mom Parkinson's, which had dementia with it, so I know what you're going through. It sounds like time to get outside help. You and your dad's needs have to be considered too. Dementia, especially Alzheimer's, can take down the best of the best family caretakers. Their needs can become far greater than our capabilities or resources at home. It can also become unsafe for your grandmother and your family. Getting up in the night with dementia poses a real risk of the patient doing something dangerous, like catching something on fire on the stove or driving when confused, both things we found my father doing when his illness took a sudden turn for the worse one weekend. It turns out that he had a raging kidney infection which made the dementia far worse. When elderly people get an infection, like a urinary tract infection, it can actually cause dementia symptoms or make existing dementia far worse and it can be life-threatening. We found that out with my dad. If you grandmother has suddenly changed, she needs to get checked out ASAP. When we got Daddy treated for a kidney infection, his dementia improved. With my mom, who became sick first, we did everything to keep her at home (nearly ten years). There were pros and cons to that. My and my dad's health suffered from the stress of caring for her at home. My dad was in early stages of Alzheimer's while we were caring for her. My dad always hated the idea of a nursing home, but his needs far outweighed what we could do at home. We had to find him the medical care he needed. There are horror stories about nursing homes, but we found a nursing home close to us that had an Alzheimer's unit and he was treated very well there. He actually improved enough to get moved into a regular room and he really thrived there and actually enjoyed it. It was a far better life for him than we could have given him at home. So not all nursing homes stories are bad. I hope you can get some much needed help. -Joy"
Namenda XR and weakness?,Does anyone here take XR after being on regular Namenda? My mom has been on XR for about a month now and her legs are weak and unstable now. We can't go back to regular strength since it is getting discontinued. Has anyone experienced this and did the weakness go away eventually?,"Hi there, Her doctor actually stopped the regular Namenda 6 months ago saying it's pretty useless for someone advanced as her. By not taking it made her worse. She had trouble getting into the car even with assistance. She basically didn't know what she was suppose to do. It's like the medicine isn't exactly helping but because she stopped taking it she was now addicted to it and need it. Usually drug makers don't discontinue a drug just because a generic is coming right? Sinemet is still around and so is Mirapex. If you are right then I hope it's very soon. I had a lot of stress the past 2weeks from her weak legs. It was so scary to not be able to lift her from one room to the other and I'm doing this alone most of the time. I have a panic disorder and this woke it up. Her doctor suggested we try Ritalin since Provigil didn't work but I forgot to get the prescript ion when we were there 2 weeks ago. She gave antibiotics assuming my mom had bronchitis and a UTI. This was all from guessing and no lab works. i only gave it to her for 3 days because it really was messing up her head and interfering with the PD drugs. My mom doesn't really sleep soundly. She makes noises and hallucinates. This is due to crushed Stalevo. Yes I have to give it to her in that format because she refuses to swallow any drugs whole. Sinemet was too weak and did not work for her. By taking Stalevo crushed she's getting it all at once. Add Mirapex to the mix and we have a recipe for zzzzzzz.


 Hi Bella, I read your other post where you told me about your mother's Parkinson's. I'm really sorry she's dealing with two diseases. Sometimes changing the delivery of a medication can affect the patient. Extended release medications sometimes don't break down in the gut on some people, which could explain the symptoms. But I'm wondering if this isn't her Parkinson's. When it advances, a month can make a marked difference in progression. In either case, you may need to contact her prescribing doctor. It may be possible, since Namenda is discontinuing its regular strength, that a generic may be coming on the market soon, which could possibly have a nonextended release dosage. I also read a post from last month where you were dealing with your mother's sleep. My mother slept around 20 hours a day too. She chose not to take Parkinson's medications and since it didn't bother her to sleep, we let her. We just had to watch for bedsores, but she only had one very small one on one ear because she slept mostly on one side. We were very fortunate that she didn't get more, but I personally bathed her and kept an eye on her skin."
Caring For Mama With Alzheimer's...,"Good Morning Everyone... When my Father died suddenly I quit my job immediately to move my Mom in with me so I could take care of her myself... She had always been my best friend... To make A long story short... The Alzheimer's patient goes back to their teenage years... So my Mom thought her youngest Son was her husband, our Dad... As hard as it seems you must go along with it & what I mean by that is keep a physical distant to prevent grabbing as they don't realize what they are doing is wrong... Here are some helpful things that I found by just working with my Mom... She died 5 years ago on June 30, 2014... 1) Do not let anyone say anything that will upset them... They won't remember what was said but they know that they were agitated... 2) I play DVD's of Engelbert Humperdinck, Tom Jones & Dean Martin for Mama.... She loved them always & it kept her calm.... I would get her up off the sofa to dance with me... It really worked well so I played them during all of her awakening hours... 3) My Mom was a devout Catholic but with Alzheimer's would cuss like a sailor LOL & let the ""F"" bomb fly... Just ignore it... 3) My Mom & I had the same Doctor so he knew us both well... He prescribed Ativan (Lorazepam) for her to help keep her calm... And Ambiem to sleep at night... I found that giving it to her at least 1 hour before bed with coffee or something hot to drink because it makes it take affect quicker then feeding her a good meal because you sleep better on a full stomach ... I take all my medicines with coffee & have for about 15 years... 4) Use Depends for them to sleep in... I told my Mom they were some fancy panties for her... LOL.... With a waterproof pad with felt on one side & plastic on the other to prevent urine from going through on the sheets... 5) I NEVER allowed anyone to tell my Mom that my Dad died from committing suicide... I never mentioned my Dad & if she brought his name up I would say I guess he's still at work & she would forget about it immediately... She didn't remember he was retired anyway... My point to not bringing him up was to keep her calm... I wanted to keep my Mom as calm as possible but without medicine... 6) Any surgery they have as my Mom had a lump removed out of her breast & they wake up worse with the Alzheimer's ... It's the sedation & being put to sleep for the surgery that does it... Non reversible... 7) Try to keep them awake during the day... As they sleep better at night... My Mom died in the hospital in my arms with her 3 favorite people with her... My little brother, my daughter & myself saying the Lord's Prayer... about 12 hours before she died she slipped into a coma state but 3 hours before she died she had ""Clarity""... It's beautiful... She said Regina I'm so sorry for what everyone has put you through... Somehow, she knew that my 2 older brothers & one of them son's my nephew had driven my crazy about trying to get money from her by sending her to court which I represented my Mom myself after spend 20K on attorney's... They call 7 times APS which all 7 times proved to be false charges against me.... My Mom's Clarity proved that she in knew what was happening... She thanked us 3 for always being with her & sticking together .... She told us she loved us so much... And that she was ready to go be with God & my Dad & her loved ones that had died years prior... The Clarity I hang on to because my Mom let me know that she knew I had gone through a divorce & that she was proud of me... I wish I could have recorded it but didn't know it existed until I saw it with my Mom... Contact me on here if I can ever help answer any questions... Or if you need someone with patients just to listen to you talk... You definitely need someone that will listen to you & actually hear what you say... Sending Prayers to all...I hope you find this helpful... Love Hugs & Kisses... Regina Lynn... [img][/img][code]","Hello Bella ......... Try to curb your bitterness for a family that doesn't give you enough support. The bitterness does no good and solves nothing. I lost my mother in January of this year - and no one else ever paid her bills and called her daily for 17-years while seeing her weekly for many years. That is the way many families are - often over-involved with themselves or with unemployement, educational needs or simply finances. I have had stage #4 cancer for 3-1/2 years, so my involvment with mom had been much less than yours. Again - most of us have circumstances we have no control over - and that we must deal with. Close to two years ago, I found a Home for Assisted Living that was geared specifically for Parkinsons and Dementia. My mother spent her last 16-months there - and it became home to her. Yes, it took some time. It always does - but the staff there was very caring. The facilities were very clean. They believed in pet therapy, so they did have in-house dogs and cats between the 4-buildings that were on site. They always had a series of programs daily - and entertainment that came in at least once a week. The Elvis Impersonator was moms favorite by far. I was kept well informed. My dog was invited to come over for a visit along with me any time I wanted. My mother used to have dogs. And in the last month or so, she thought i was bringing her dog over to see her. While it was costly, it was a wonderful way for her to spend her last years .... and we avoided having to put her into a nursing home approved for medicaid. I was her only regular weekly visitor - although my youngest daughter went to see her every few months. And a friend of the family went to see her every few months. I wrote the thread ""What to Do?"" in this forum. There is a ton of detail there. Since I was the only child, there was no one to argue with about her money - a good thing. As long as she had money or home equity, she was NOT going to go into a medicaid home. I watched my grandmother go thru that with alzheimers - mom was not going to go thru that - and she didn't! Whenever you make a decision ..... do NOT hold yourself to blame for it. It is time to take care of yourself. Rob & Gizmo


 Bella ........ My mother was having problems for many years - and was very independant after my Father passed 19-years ago. It was a fall in her own home on Easter - over 3-years ago - that put her into the hospital. During her hospital stay, her Doctor wanted her to be under observation because of her indignance by the hospital workers. She was diagnosed with Dementia before she was released - and in order for her to be released in May of 2011 - I needed to get her a 24/7 live-in care-giver. Until her diagnosis, she was blaming things on me and some of her neighbors - mostly signs of distrust! After the care-givers started, she started to blame them for theft - including calling the police once on them for a stolen bracelet. A few days later, we found the bracelet buried in a cushion of the recliner she always used. One of the care-givers quit after that incident. But, there was a care-giver living with her for the next 15-months. She was also back in the hospital twice - both times in the psychiatric ward. When being released the second time, her psychiatrist said she needed to go into a home. The caregivers she had were not experienced enough in nursing to handle her any more. So she was released directly from the hospital to the Assisted Living Home - and was there for 16-months. In my locale, there were quite a few Homes for Dementia patients that each had a certain number of beds approved for use by medicaid patients. The trouble was the waiting line was so long, it could take several years for someone waiting - to actually get a medicaid bed. In some cases, the patient had to be enrolled as a paying patient first - and then, when an opening came, they could have the medicaid bed - being paid for by the government. I did go to one Nursing Home that accepted medicaid and it was very much under-staffed and with no private or even semi-private bathrooms. And they had no programs to keep the minds moving of the patients. It was very depressing .... and people shouldn't be treated like cattle - as they were there. All I can suggest is to look at a lot of places. They're likely to be very expensive - which might be where a larger family can help out. And - you might find a medicaid approved Nursing Home that can meet your standards. Just take the time to look and take notes - maybe even photos! Rob & Gizmo


 Bella, Not all nursing homes stories are nightmares. We had to place my father in a nursing home when all his medical conditions were too much for home and he had a good life there. He was far better off than at home. I have Crohn's and had helped him care for my mother at home for close to ten years and I just couldn't do what he needed. His doctors said he needed 24/7 care. You can't do it alone. I was extremely close to my parents, having lived next door for almost 30 years, so I understand, but there comes a time when you have to let someone help you help them. It may take some work, but hopefully you can find a good facility. My mother had to be in one for two weeks before she died after a hip break, and while not terrible by any means, I knew I wouldn't place Daddy there when he needed care. It was at a home in the same town however that we place him and the atmosphere was very different and a much better fit for him. Not everything was perfect, I got annoyed at times, but the staff did listen and work with us and took good care of him. We found a home that wanted family coming in all the time and encouraged it. That's a good sign to me that they weren't hiding poor treatment. I hope you can get some help soon. You both need it.

 Bella, Have you checked into Home Health Care? In my state, Medicaid will pay for 24hr. care for 5 days a week. That might be a better fit for you and your mom. The homes we checked out had policies against using restraints. That's why they have special units so that they can be watched so as not to hurt themselves but have as much freedom as is medically possible. When my father was in the Alzheimer's unit, the patients got very close attention. I can't say that it would be that way anywhere else. When we would come into the unit, it was as home-like as possible. This unit, which was a part of a larger nursing home, was set aside where they had far more attendants, and patients were never tied down. They had their own little kitchen, living room where they could watch TV like a family, an outdoor area, etc. Of course there were patients that were too sick to be up and about , but they were watched carefully. My father was never restrained at the nursing home, but when he was in the hospital several times during this time, would be restrained because when he had a raging infection, he couldn't control himself. It was miserable for him. We made arrangements to have him a sitter 24/7 while he was hospitalized, which was paid for by his Medicare, so that he didn't have to be tied down. So I know how you feel. No one will be able to replace you in your mother's life no matter how good a job they do. I'm not trying to convince you of that, but you sound like you are burning yourself out and seriously need help. If it comes to the point of having to place her in a home, you can still be a big part of her care if you're able. You can brush her teeth 3x a day if you don't like how they do it. I know one woman in Daddy's home whose sister came and stayed with her every single day. My mother couldn't lift a finger and we family members waited on her all the time when we could. Same with Daddy. These homes encourage that. And if you both are miserable and want her back at home, you can change your mind and do that.


 I know it's tough. My mother was orphaned at age 6 and all her life she was terrified to be alone. I wound up living next door to her and even though I longed to live somewhere else, I never moved away because she couldn't bear the thought of my leaving. And she went everywhere with me. After she became ill with advanced Parkinson's, my father and I, along with my sister, took care of her at home, without Home Health (excepting a few months of in-home physical therapy). Medicare didn't pay for Home Health, though they did offer Hospice. Her last few years, she couldn't bear for my dad to leave her sight, even with one of us there with her. I'm glad you have more help than I at first thought. I was worried that you were doing it entirely without help, but that's still a lot on you. They become our babies.


 Hi Regina, I just read your posting and I am in tears. My mom has Parkinsons and dementia. I am her only caregiver because my sister and brothers do not live near us. It has been a struggle the past 8 years I did it and I love my mom dearly so I sacrifice my health and social life to take care of her every need. I take my mom to a daycare center while I go to work and I hired a helper to take her home and stay with her until I get home from work. it worked out fine all these years until this week when everything came crashing down on me. The daycare center called me and said they can no longer handle my mom because she's too heavy to lift and they do not want to injure their workers. My helper of 6 years quit 1 month ago and I hired a new person who was just starting out and was having problems dealing with my mom's special needs. My mom got bronchitis with UTI and needed antibiotics. This explained her sudden loss of leg strength and the ability to walk with assistance. Since I am alone I was having a great deal of struggle to get her to the bathroom and bed once the helper leaves. I convinced my sister to come and help me but she would only stay a couple of days. My anxiety has been going through the roof because of having to deal with this alone again when she leaves. My sister wants our mother in a home so we can all have our life back. I am fighting it because I have separation anxiety when I am away from her. I have been with my mom for the past 8 years without missing a single day. For all these years I have managed to care for my mom but now with her legs not cooperating it is next to impossible to move her around. I do not know what to do. I refuse to let her go. I hear horror stories about these homes and even if they treat her right she is still with strangers and will feel all alone and look for me. Just thinking about it is making me cry now. My mom is like a child and is very needy with me. I was the same way with her growing up which is why I am the way I am now with her. I suppose I'm just venting and not looking for solutions because the obvious one is to send her to a home since I can't do it by myself anymore. I am just so lost and feel so alone with out support from family. Lots of families care for their sick parents when it is done as teamwork. I do not have that network of support so I am very bitter and sad. Thanks for listening. I don't know what will happen in the coming days.


 My mom has medi-caid. What happens to people in those nursing homes? Are they bad? I heard nice private facilities allow medi-caid patients. Is that wrong? Was your mom ill when she went to the assisted living place? How come she only last 16 months? I am terrified if she goes away then her life will not last as long. I will read your posting after this. Right now I am in the selfish phase. I don't care that my sister has a life away from us. I just want her to treat out mother as her top priority just as I do so she should drop everything and stay with us until our mom gets better. I know it's a childish and unrealistic demand but I am gutless right now so I feel like a helpless puppy. I just want to curl up in a ball and go to sleep and wake up the next day as if last week never happened. My mom sleeps most of the day and has no interest in anything. She gets very annoyed with loud noises and will not participate in anything. She does not like pets but loves babies. However her attention span is very short so she will focus on a baby for about 20 seconds then she will look away. It's not so much that my mom has changed but that it's now I'm reacting to the change. I am a creature of habit and as long as things stay the same I am calm and rational. If a routine is messed up I freak out and a thousand thoughts go through my mind and I want things done ASAP or else it will stay in my head. My mom is totally oblivious to what's happening. As long as she sees me she's happy and content. I have a panic disorder that has blown up this past week. I am still dealing with the fear as best as I can. I just wish it will go away. Thanks for listening. I know I'm not the only person to go through something like this but when it's happening to you personally, you just don't know any better.


 So sorry about your mom's mental state. My mom is quite the opposite. She's very timid and smiles and never says much. The problem with her is that her legs give out and due to the Parkinsons she is quite rigid and very hard to lift. Our last helper was a big woman so she lasted 6 years and was the only one we ever used. We really were very lucky to have had her for all these years. Just the thought of sending my mom away has put me in such a depression that I have lost 10 pounds this past week. We have always been close and co-dependent on each other. No one seems to understand what I'm going through because they do not have the bond I have with my mom. I'm not saying I love my mom more than anyone else with their mom but I was always by her side since I was a baby and she always protected me from everything. When she started to get sick I took over the mother role and never stopped. My sister married young and left the nest a long time ago so she sees our mother as a responsibility and not so much as her mommy like me. Her solution is to send her somewhere that she will be well cared for and that's the end of it. I see it as our mother going to a strange place and being scared out of her existence and forgotten. I just need to pray really hard for peace and borrow more time with my mom. Thank you.


 Thanks for the info. Were they placed in a medi-caid paid home? We can't afford the private facilities which is why I am very hesitant about the state run type. My mom is all I have. The thought of not being able to see her when I want and take care of her is killing me inside. She's very much like a child and gets scared very easily and always looks for me. I'm already getting upset just thinking about her leaving me.


 The homes by me are less than ideal and they do have medicaid beds available but that's just it. I feel like my mom will be strapped to her bed 24/7 until she leaves this earth. There will not be any one on one interaction with the nurses. No one would notice if her nose is running or her mouth is dry and she needs water and will anyone brush her teeth 3 times a day like I do and take out her partials while doing it? Will they give her medication on time? These are thoughts that are in my head all day long. I am so stressed out.


 Thanks for your suggestions JaSanne. I do have home health care but it only covers 80 hours a month. I pay way more for the helper I have because it's now become full time. I have been trying to get a hold of the social worker that covers my mom's case but I can't find her. I am in big denial. I cannot process the fact that my mommy is getting older and sicker. When I used to drop her off at the daycare center and had to leave her for work I would get sick to my stomach. She would watch me leave with a look of abandonment. When I was little I used to have separation anxiety from her whenever she dropped me off at school. This just goes round and round. Nursing homes is so.... final. I know you said I can always take her home if it doesn't work out but just planning it gives me hives. I talked to my boss about my situation and she was tearing up because she felt so touched by the bond I have with my mom and could feel the pain I am going through. It's tough."
Fears-Mother thinks I'm the other woman,"How do I deal with this. Saturday I realized that not only does she associate my face with ""the other woman,"" but also my name. I have 5 sisters and it happens to them on occasion where mom thinks they are having an affair with dad. She even suspected one of her grand daughters. Always accusing. However, I seem to be the focus and it hurts immensely and obviously my presence hurts her, agitates her greatly, which in turn upsets my dad. Do I stay away for a couple of weeks in hopes she'll forget? Do I disguise myself? Do I use a different name? What should I do. I'm so incredibly down in the dumps about this. Saturday at a wedding reception I was standing next to my mom and my dad on the other side of her wheelchair and after about 10 minutes, one of my sisters whispered in my hear, ""Dad said you need to leave."" Can you imagine hearing those words? I cannot get them out of my head","My dad accused my sister of stealing his wallet.. She was devastated and wanted to stop helping him... Then he did the same thing to our brother which helped a little bit. The worst that I would get was when he would CALL ME to tell me he can't find his phone.... When I asked him what he was using to CALL ME a little light bulb would go off.. So hang tight, maybe she'll get over this...


 I know this has got to be rough on you and even if you tell yourself that it's not really her speaking, it's still a tough blow. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do but keep trying to be there for her. It's nothing personal. She is stuck in her own little world and no matter what anybody says, it doesn't change the fact that she's not in her right mind. It's not her speaking but her dementia. I had a bout of that with my gma, but unfortunately the victim was my then 10 year old daughter. It wasn't the other woman but my gma would always accuse my daughter of stealing. I know it's tough to deal with dementia as an adult but it's even worse for a child. All you can really do is bite your tongue and honestly, try not to take it personal. This is not your mother speaking but an alter ego so to speak."
"Missing my mom, worried she won't know me","My mother is in a nursing home with Dementia. I live about 4800 kms from her and am not able to see her but once every couple of years due to work. She has been in 2 care homes and has progressed very quickly. about a year after diagnosis she fell out of bed and broke her hip. Due to the fact that the initial care home had stairs she remained in hospital for a couple of months under excessive medications in order to keep her calm. Finally she was placed. After she broke her hip she was not the same whatsoever. She is in a wheelchair now, she is unable to speak clearly, and has no control over her bodily functions. I was able to visit her this past Sept, which was a releif. The home she is in is taking very good care of her. She knew myself and my husband immediately...and had a good visit. Her condition is progressing and I am worried she won't know me by the time I make it to see her again as when her brother went to see her she didn't know him. I have never know anyone with this condition..is it possible to progress so quickly or could the heavy sedation over a couple of months in hospital cause such an advancement, and if so why would the hospital do such a thing?","On April 24,2014....my mother passed away. I miss her terribly, but she is no longer suffering. She would have been 69 on the 27th. Heaven defnitely has another angel. My thoughts are with all of you who have loved ones struggling with this awful disease. RIP mom, I love you, Post Edited (The Baby) : 6/23/2014 7:07:57 PM (GMT-6)


 Thank you....and be well.


 So terrible. It's bad enough your grandma had to go to the home for her protection but to be neglected by them in the end is inexcusable. She deserved so much better. Sorry that your family had to do go through that too. I will try everything in my power to keep my mom home. There has to be a better way. Thank you.


 What did your mom do that the caregiver couldn't handle and you had to hand her to a nurse? May I ask what was the cause of her death? Do you worry that you will have the same condition being that your grandma and mother had it?


 Oh... on everything. I don't get how you die from dementia? Everyone ultimately dies from heart failure but if your mom had a strong heart that I really don't get it. But then at 96 maybe her batteries just wore out and she hopefully died in her sleep? So your mom was acting out which scared the heck out of the caregiver I'm sure. My mom is very quiet like a mouse. If anything she doesn't follow directions or do anything at all. I'm very sorry about your own health problems. It must be very tough and unsettling for you. I wish you the best and may God look after you and when you are 75 throw yourself a grand party and hopefully you will still have your mind and remember to do so. Good luck!


 Too sad to think about . I cannot imagine working in hospice. If you have stage 4 lung cancer then their is still hope for you. I know 2 people who survived it but my cousin didn't. 2 out of 3 ain't bad.


 You have so much to deal with but you seem very strong. Life really sucks. I wish we can all live in a clean germ free bubble. That would be my ideal world. I'm sure I don't need to tell you but spend your precious time doing what you want and with the people you love. I'm learning to live day by day now and not think so much ahead with the what if's and how can I do.... Take care.


 From my understanding nursing homes drug patients to get them out of their hair. When the mind is always at rest then the brain cells die quicker. This is my theory. Try and picture yourself in your mom's shoes. You are sent to a nursing home and away from family and familiar surroundings. That's gotta make her worse. Not trying to make you feel bad but it makes sense that she's going downhill. Even though they are taking good care of her physically there is still the mental care that is missing. They are just doing their job so there is no attachment to your mom like you or your brother has with her. I know we all wish someone else can provide what you are not able to do but it rarely happens. I keep my mom close and do everything for her. I know it's not always possible but just do what you can. Take care.


 So sorry for your loss Baby. I don't know what else I can say. Take care.


 Lost my grandmother in 2002, but sort of in an Alzheimers way. In the course of years passing. It is quite similar in many ways. She had Dimentia with Lewy Bodies, where her brain cells were somehow mutating while these ""Lewy Bodies"" attached themselves to the remaining ones to keep her alive, if I recall the collegial article we read on it. One difference is that they can remember you one day and forget you the next. You can hug her like always and call her grandma one day, and the next day she may think you are her husband from years past. Then that one horrible day comes when the kids are there to see her and she asks ""who are these children"" ? Hard to handle, to say the least. She was my best friend, and we tried to fix her up for home living, but she simply wouldn't stay in bed at night. She just had to do something for lack of sleep, and her brain activity. Oftentimes some of her common activities were dangerously weird, such as pouring dishwashing liquid into a frying pan and trying to cook something with it. She wound up in a nursing home as recommended and directed by our family doctor and seemed well-sedated and happy, but losing us more and more each day. She was 86 when she died, but it was not the illness that got her. It was a urinary tract infection due to poor cleaning of her private area. We would never have known why, until that fateful day when I was called to the emergency room in her last hours. The nursing home has changed it's name and our aging family doctor is no longer the director there. He loved her too, but in a Medicare/Medicaid setting such as the common nursing home, one cannot control who they hire among all the end-of-the-road'ys. It is the nature of gov't-sponsored ""healthcare"". My family never pursued any legal actions. Post Edited (JackLegofAllTrades) : 7/26/2014 12:01:22 AM (GMT-6)


 Hello ........ I too lost my mother to Dementia. It was on January 14, 2014. I think, the medicaid choices of care are either very limited - or are mostly poor in quality. The term ""Nursing Home"" is sometimes over-used or mis-used. It seems to be a catch-all for aged care .... and that's just not complete at all. My mothers last 16-months were in an Assisted Living Home for Dementia and Parkinsons. It was a wonderful place of caring - with daily programs to keep the mind busy, weekly entertainment brought in and very decent food. I ate there three times - always unannounced! Yes ..... it is more expensive than most any medicaid facility. However, I watched my grandmother (mothers mother) die of alzheimers complications while she spent her last 3-years or so in a medicaid nursing home. Yep - it was cheap. Yep - it was disgusting. But .... I guess my mother chose to put her there and pcket grandma's savings. Nasty - but true!!!! When it came time for mother to have help, she first stayed at home with 24/7 care - a required by her doctor - for 15-months. Then, the Dementia got to the point, again according to her doctor, for her to now have daily care by a registered nurse - not a home caregiver any more. So ....... for 31-months, a lot of money was spent on her care. Much of that was grandmas money ... and then my mothers house was sold - to help keep her in the Assisted Living Home for up to another 20-months or so. If the finances don't allow it, the medicaid choices are not good. In my mothers case, I didn't care if all of her money was used to keep her out of a medicaid facility. I saw what it did to my grandmother 25-years ago. Wishing you peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo


 Hello Bella33 ......... My mother, while home and under the care of a caregiver - was beginning to get very irrational nightmares. After a particularily bad only - where she was screaming that someone was killing her, the caregiver called the hospital and me. The hospital got ahold of the staff psychiatrist and he ordered an ambulance for her - and to be brought into the hospital. She was in the psychiatric ward for over three weeks - did get somewhat better - but the staff doctor would not allow her to go back home. His direction was she must go into a home that has at least one RN on staff at all times. The caregivers did not have enough medical experience. Her death certificate states ..... Dementia ...... as the cause of death. She was also 96 with a strong heart and never even one major surgery in her life. I am not the least bit concerned about getting either Dementia or Alzheimers. You see .... I do have COPD, have had kidney failure three times so far - and do have stage #4 cancer. All three are incurable. I would be gratious to make it to 75!!!! Rob & Gizmo


 Bella33 ....... As it was explained to me by hospice, there comes a time with a Dementia patient where one of two things will likely happen: 1) Eating stops ....... or 2) A part of the throat starts closing up - and often allows food into the lungs - which ultimately chokes off the air to the patient. And of course, pneumonia is very possible. She was in a comma for 10 to 12-hours before she passed - it seems not knowing what was going on. R & G


 Bella ...... I could never work for hospice myself - but my limited experience with them was very good ...... great care for both the patient and the loved ones. Great communications too! about cancer - I do not have lung cancer. It is metastisized Prostate Cancer. Metastisized simply means the cancer has spread and is now considered stage #4. In my case, it did spread to my liver, adrenal glands, blocked both kidneys, one lymph node, my ribcage - and recently a new tumor in the pelvic area. In blocking the kidneys over 3-1/2 years ago, I have had kidney failure (three times hospitalized) and my left kidney is worthless - even with an internal stent ... and my right kidney is OK as long as I keep a nefrostomy tube in place to aid the kidney function. I have been writing for and reading the Prostate Cancer Forum for over 13-months - and there has not been one survivor of this. It is a slow killer, but there are no known full remissions that I'm aware of. Lung cancer itself, is hardly a comparison to what I have. I am not minimizing lung cancer - my step-father had a portion of his lung removed because of lung cancer. Metastisized cancer cannot be operated on - and there is NO cure for it whether by chemo or hormone therapy or both! It's just life! The reality of life - to accept - then deal with!"

Husband refuses to visit mother in nursing home,"We recently admitted my mother-in-law to a nursing home (about 8 weeks ago). She has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Her physician has informed us that she is failing to thrive. My husband refuses to go visit her, especially now that she is deteriorating. He loves his mother very much and has always had a good relationship with her. I invite him to come with me every time I go visit her, but he declines. When I informed him of her recent condition, I stressed that it was important to spend some time with her. He told me that he does not want to see her that way. I'm afraid that he will regret his decision after she passes. Should I be more forceful about him visiting her, or is this just his way of dealing with it? I would appreciate feedback!","Thank you for your response. I am unsure if my mother-in-law can recognize any of us at this point, but one never knows when there might be a moment of clarity. You are right about it being a man thing. My daughter and I are able to go visit, yet my husband and sons refuse. Both of my sons (23 & 21) both shared with me that they are unable to bring themselves to go. I guess women are stronger emotionally. I guess I know who I can count on when and if my time comes!!


 I'm sorry for a late response (I've been incredibly busy). But no one can force your husband to go. It's a tough hill to climb in the mental aspect of seeing someone you love decline so rapidly. It's sort of a mental block or a mental stubbornness...possibly even fear. I know I have a hard time with the very same thing. It took me a long time to overcome this fear and do I regret not seeing someone I love before they passed? Most defintely! But when I was caring for my Gma, who had dementia, I had no choice but to face it. Now, I make it a point to be there when I can. However, it took me a very long time to face it. Perhaps your hubby wants to remember her the way she was and not have the memory of how she is now haunting him. Love in itself is a very powerful emotion and it can enable us or cripple us. All you can really do is encourage him to see her. She may not remember who anyone is but deep down she still has that sense of comfort from the people that she loved. She's still in there somewhere.


 I'm sorry that someone hasn't posted earlier. We had family members who were this way in regard to both my parents when they were in their latter stages of their diseases. My parents were hurt that these family members wouldn't come see them. I don't know if your loved one is still able to know people, but if she is, it does matter. But you can't make them come. My sister and I still had to oversee our parents' care even, and especially, with them in a nursing home. They still had to have an advocate. They still needed love, even when they weren't conscious. I understand the ""I want to remember them the way they were"" feeling, but we have to do what's right for the patient and not be giving in to our sentiments. No one wants to be abandoned by a family member just because it makes them feel uncomfortable, but your husband's reaction is not new. Men, in my opinion, are probably more susceptible about this than women because it's not socially acceptable in some minds for men to openly show emotions, which is ridiculous, but anyway... I don't know if my family members feel regret, but I know how it made my parents feel. These family members have to live with their decisions, not me. I really commend you for standing by your mother-in-law. My mother and dad, one with Parkinson's and the other with Alzheimer's, both recognized my husband even when they didn't recognize me at times, which was comforting to me. I hope your husband changes his mind. Post Edited (JaSanne) : 8/31/2014 9:39:05 AM (GMT-6)


 I'm sorry I haven't answered back. I'm not online often and I have my own memory problems remembering where I posted. You're right in that they can have moments of clarity and it's really special when they do. I hope your husband and sons can overcome their feelings, but there are a lot of men that way. My brother's sons were the ones who couldn't bring themselves to visit the nursing home. Some people are afraid of nursing homes in general. It can be overwhelming."
Hallucinations and Delusions,"My sister the saint looks after our dad way more than I do... But I spent several hours with him yesterday. His current big concern are the ""people"" that visit him in his apartment. These people watch tv or sleep in the trash can etc... He says sometimes if he catches them before they've been there too long he can chase them away... They seem to show up everyday around 5pm... I found the article below but thought I'd get some feedback from you guys... Thanks in advance. Dementia can affect how an individual perceives the world. A person with dementia may think that she can see or hear something that isn't there or believe something that is not true. In earlier stages of the disease, she will usually be able to recognize that this is simply a figment of her imagination. However, as the disease progresses, these individuals may begin to have more and more trouble distinguishing between fantasy and reality. www.dementiacarecentral.com/caregiverinfo/hallucinations-and-delusions","Thank you for the reply... What really makes me scratch my head is that my dad knows that he is hallucinating.. But that power of knowledge does him no good. And come to find out, the hallucinations start after he wakes up from a late afternoon nap. Lil Sis called a couple of hours ago. They are going to e doc appoint ment next week..


 Hello Steve ...... Sorry to say that the imagination can become very frightening to one with dementia. My Mother was diagnosed with dimentia close to three years ago, but probably had some small signs of it for as much as ten years. She was, after being released from the hospital in April of 2011 after a fall at home, back home but with a full-time live-in caregiver - as required by the releasing doctor. She was at home for about 16-months - and during that timeframe, she had at least three major episodes at night. In the most severe episode, she felt someone was in her home wanting to kill her, and the caregiver needed to call me - then call 911 to get her into a hospital ER. After close to a one month stay in the psychiatric ward of the hospital, that doctor said she could no longer go home under the care of a 24/7 caregiver. He told me she needed to go into a Home that had an on-duty RN full-time on staff. She has been in that home for the past 15-months now. One thing to note ......... the new doctor (from that Home) took her off of Namenda shortly after her getting there. In his opinion, the Namenda, at this stage of the Dementia was doing her more harm than good. She doesn't have the extreme nightr terrors anymore. So I was told by an RN there, the Namenda works well in the early stages of Dementia but not in the later stages. Check with her doctor! Good luck. Rob & Gizzy"
The effect of salt on the brain.,"Not sure this is the right forum, but I feel I have something say about losing memory and mental clarity in general from my recent experience. Or just the cognitive behavior in general. I am in my mid 40s. There were times, and recently more often, I felt that my mind was really blurry and slow to react to things, it was reaching but couldn't reach anywhere. I have wondered that at this rate, will I not be able to remember my social security number at some point? It's a scary thought. I have been able to function at work and at home, but efficiency is very low. There were some days when things just worked a lot better for me, so it was encouraging for me to realize the extent of my mental capabilities. I was trying to figure out what that thing was that made me more efficient and productive during these moments. I took vitamins, B complex, fish oil, garlic tablets, all kinds of things. Some worked some times, but not consistently. Then something happened last week. I cooked some green vegetables, by accident, I put extra salt. The kids didn't eat it because it was too salty, I had to eat it. Then magically, after a long day of mental blur and trying, things just opened up for me mentally. I have to attribute to extra salt that made this dramatic mental impact on me. If you do a search on google about salt, they will say that salt is an important electrolyte and transmits electrical impulses in the body, for muscles and nerves and many other functions. I think that lack of salt was exactly my problem of all these years and moments, it was the lack of optimum mental activities because of lack of electrical signals in the brain. But too much salt is not good for the heart. That's well known, and my heart is actually pretty sensitive to extra salt. I guess if there is too much salt in heart muscles, you will have too many electrical signals in heart muscles, and then there will be irregular heart beats and you will have heart trouble. So I have been careful to feel my own body's reaction to the extra salt. Eat a banana before eating a peanut butter sandwich with extra salt in the morning. Drink more water to dilute salt in the body, but then eat a bowl of soup for lunch to put back some more salt. For the past two weeks, I feel that I have improved dramatically my comprehension and interaction with other people. I feel that I was more on top of things. In the end, it's always a balance between things. But looking at the emphasis on less salt in the diet in the last 3 or 4 decades and the increase in dementia like mental illnesses, I think that reduced salt intake is one of the factors. But how do you balance out with the bad effects for the heart? I think there is a way in the end, whether from your personal experimentation or from the medical science research community. I am not a doctor, I just work with computers.","I didn't know that there are doctors out there who actually recommend a salty diet. I guess in my case, maybe I am at an age that the brain cells can still recover from the past damages of reduced salt, and the effect has been dramatic and consistent for the past two weeks, in terms of mental clarity and emotional state. I have been careful not to take too many things in my body, so I can experiment with different elements and point to the cause and effect, and it won't overwhelm my body. I have prided myself on being a very technically capable person. But when my mind was reaching hard for connections, and when I was reading a long sentence, midway through it, I had to remember what the beginning was like, it made me wonder about my mental capacity. My mother died when I was 35 years old, that could be considered a stress factor in my life. But I believed that there were chemical and physical factors, and then there were moments when I was absolutely in control of myself. If you look up benefits of salt online, there are quite many articles. Those two links below interested me the most. They talk about being beneficial to the brain cells and nerves. curezone.com/foods/salt/vital_functions_of_salt_in_the_b.htm www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/salt.htm I dare say this, the lack of salt is at least a factor, and a major factor from my experience, to the degrading mental health. I know the medical established will probably laugh this off. But if some doctor or researcher could design a study on the effect of salt on Alzheimer's disease, I think they will be positively surprised. I believe in simple solutions, and a good solution should be explained using common sense. When things become too fancy and complicated, they usually fail, like those complicated mortgage contracts that caused the financial crisis.


 I was questioning at one point whether I have some kind of chronic fatigue as well. I read your other post about your father's beer drinking, and I think I know the answer. It has to do with drinking too much fluid, it could be either beer or just soft drinks, and diluting the salt away from his body. His mental capacity is diminished because of reduced salt. I came to the conclusion about drinking too much liquid sometime last year. One night, I wasn't in a mood to concentrate on anything, so I started drinking orange juice, Pepsi, and just plain water, I wasn't really thirsty but it made me feel better. The next morning, I felt a hung over like after drinking a lot of alcohol, but I knew I just drank water. So I have kept myself from drinking too much water before going to bed. Now I realize that the real effect was more from salt being diluted away from the body than just having too much water itself. I also read the part about B12. In fact, about a month ago, I started taking B12 complex by accident, and it did bring much better mental clarity. I made me believe that I was deficient in B12 all along. But then my sleep was disrupted and B12 wasn't as effective consistently. Fish oil was effective initially, but then its effect went away. It was only with salt that the mental clarity was consistent. What I can do now is to replace a cup of coffee with a cup of warm salt water, and could function as well or even better. I am not a big coffee drinker, but I have been drinking a 9oz cup of coffee every morning. I still like drinking coffee because of the taste. But kicking the habit wasn't hard for me.


 It makes sense in the fact that Sodium/potassium gates open and close neural pathways. it also makes sense because it is so easy to be dehydrated if you even start to feel thirsty you are already at the beginning stages of dehydration, which everyone knows how important fluid is in our bodies. i read an article for continuing ed on headaches, because i am a huge migraine sufferer. anyway the article stated 83% of regular headaches can be totally eliminated by plenty of fluids in a day. Sinus... stress, some cluster and migraine... because you are constantly cleaning and flushing it through your system. for one Caffeinated drink you have to drink two decaffeinated drinks to offset the one. I would be careful to over do the salt. as it can be hazardous to other things but if you can eat a banana a day for K (potassium) or take it through a pill form up the h20 and use a sea salt. it would be interesting. I get brain fog a lot. I had an 8 hour psych test 4 years after i returned home from serving in the Persian gulf war. i felt like i couldn't do things as well, I am requesting the same test because that was a base line and now i feel more like a rock. lol Even though to me it is not really funny and at times scary when i don't know simple things. I would re: a metabolic panel ran just to see what you are low on such as K or Na there are simple vitamins and minerals that can cause us to have a fogginess. But I am also the big 40. my husband is healthy and he says he has to read every day or he feels like he doesn't think as well. sometimes, like a muscle maybe we just need to exercise or challenge it. IDK I am not a Dr. Good luck to you ... but remember everything in moderation... too much of one thing probably isn't good for something else... idk for sure but it is a educated guess. May each day bring you more joy than the day before and Hope. Diana


 Salty Soup, very interesting conclusions you have drawn. I would agree that you would benefit greatly from a medical work-up by your physician and that it should include a complete blood panel and include electrolytes and various other minerals and vitamin levels in your blood. They all interact so much, that assigning any one as the 'culprit' is often a bit one-sided. We really are made up of a mixture of elements and they all need to be in balance with each other. Too much of one can throw so many others off balance. And remember, that not only our diets, but also our medication consumption and stress levels can impact these elements.


 I'm on a high salt diet myself to help raise my blood pressure; I tend to run on the low end - the higher salt intake has not helped my mental fogginess though. But people with high blood pressure should stay away from high salt intake. People who run the risk of AD are thought to have a certain protein created by a set of genes. One of the risks for people with this set of genes also may experience long standing high blood pressure. If you want to ask about the correlation between high salt intake and the heart you might want to ask your questions over on our heart forum. They might be able to help you with any concerns you may have.


 I was told many year ago that h high percentage of people in mental institutions have low cholesterol or low blood pressure. this is very interesting to me because I have to put a little sea salt in my water otherwise it is going right through me. When you think about it even lithium is a salt. has anyone ever googled NMH. I forgot the real name for it but if you google NMH and chronic fatigue and look around you will see how important the salt thing is.


 There is a difference between people that are admitted into mental institutions and people that have Alzheimer's. Most people with Alzheimer's do not have a mental illness. Alzheimer's is not a mental illness. There is a true physiological component to AD. The death of these ""proteins"" in the brain can cause ""plaques"" to form on the brain of an AD patient. AD patients are discouraged from a high salt intake diet because of high blood pressure. I am only stating this because if someone comes along and thinks that giving salt to their loved ones will help with cognitive difficulties that it may be dangerous, especially if they have high blood pressure to begin with. But yes, for people with low blood pressure, doctors will recommend a higher salt intake along with more water consumption. My bp drops dangerously low at times and I went thru a tilt table test as well as a stress test with echo. The doctors have told me to increase my salt and water. I'm glad you found something that works for you Salty Soup. Just be forewarned that too much potassium is not always a good thing either. Which brings a question - have you ever had your potassium checked?


 I haven't read all the threads on this topic, so if I repeat something please excuse me. I have been reading a lot recently on the use of Celtic salt ( from France) which contains 82 trace minerals and is about as close to the chemistry of fluids of the body as any substance containing salt can be. (After using unrefined salt for about three weeks now, I think I like Himalayan unrefined salt just a little better. It's really quite good.) The advantages of Celtic salt are that it will lower blood pressure when it's high, and raise it when blood pressure is low (because of the enzymes and trace minerals in the salt). Be sure to drink water, too. It is excellent for modifying and reducing sinus problems , bronchitis problems, asthma, and excess mucus, for the same reasons. (It is known that people who work in the salt mines of the Himalayas rarely ever have a respiratory illness.) This is a particularly difficult time for allergies this spring in our section of the country, so I've bought some and plan to use it to see if it really works. I think it must really be helpful. The major benefit of Celtic salt is that it reduces the acidity of brain cells and helps in creating a more alkaline state of fluids. Those factors alone make it well worth a try. American brands of salt are refined and do not contain the enzymes that can be activated and the multiple trace minerals in Celtic Grey Salt, and so it's really not as beneficial for the human. In addition, American salts that are refined may have aluminum added for special purposes, and aluminum has been implicated now as a possible influence in Alzheimer's Disease. (I have no association with any products from France. I just do my own research on these matters because they interest me, and I find many of the ideas very helpful.) I read recently that, during World War II, Navy surgeons who ran out of blood for transfusions used ocean water to inject for blood transfusions and saved many lives aboard ship by doing that. If interested, see benefits of www.celticsalt.com . Many other references are helpful by googling unrefined salt benefits. It's Genetic Post Edited (It's Genetic) : 4/16/2012 7:47:46 AM (GMT-6)


 Hi I know this is very old now, but I'd like to have a quick chat with you Salty Soup if possible as I may be having a similar issue to the one you had - and would love a bit of reassurance if you could help? Cheers Starsi360"

Rapid Decline in motor skills in 3 weeks...,"First post, have been pulling my hair out trying to wrap my head around this, and finally decided to find an active forum. Without going into the whole thing I was wondering how quickly people can go from walking to being bedbound as my grandmother has gone from being able to go to the bathroom, walk, and feed herself to needing assistance with everything including eating in drinking in about 3 weeks. She was diagnosed with Dementia last year, but has been able to manage herself fairly well aside from being hateful when we had to get help for my grandfather who also had memory issues. He passed a month ago, she's done fairly well with it, but starting going downhill since the doctors adjusted her medicine a few times. Her memory has gotten sharper (in my opinion), but her motor skills have significantly declined. She was checked out for strokes, had bloodwork done, checked for UTI's etc.. and everything has come back fine. Over the course of the last week (or a little before) she started having trouble with the bathroom and a little more difficulty walking which started around the last time they changed her meds. We had assumed that was the issue, her doctor was notified and he told us to cut a med out. Family decided to cut the med (1 day) and then just went ahead and took her to the hospital to get checked out... Again no issues with any of the tests. I understand this can be an affect of late stage dementia, but have never heard of it coming on this quickly as she hasn't had a stroke and her health is actually good from the tests and scans. It's also confusing that her memory has gotten better and she's more talkative while her motor skills have gone downhill. The doctors news was about as grim as you can possibly get today (suggest hospice), but my grandmother is talking, knows exactly who we are, and is hungry wanting food... it's just the motor skills. Just wanted to see if anyone had some thoughts on the situation. Everything I've read for late stages says that swallowing, etc... can be an issue, but it also says they won't even know who you are or where they are by that time. Not the case with her...","This is actually my 3rd experience with Hospice, as my dad had it before he decided to go home and passed, and my grandfather had it at home to help him pass. Grandmother on my fathers side did the same thing at home. The people are nice, but weren't very helpful when I asked a few questions about therapy and what they can do with patients. I understand they may not be setup for it, but they weren't helpful in the way that a lot of other agencies have been as far as pointing you in the right direction. All we got was a doctor will be in on Friday. That said, they have always been good with us when someone is nearing the end, I'm just not sure it's the place for someone that needs a push and some motivation. I'm not sure about the whole graduation thing, but I had heard it mentioned a few times online. They didn't tell us anything about it -- it was basically put to us as they watch her until she goes or they send her home if she gets better on her own. I'm sure hospice is different in different areas, but I haven't been all that impressed this time around. There were some things about her room as well, but no need to go into all that. As of now, we're hoping she'll continue to try and feed herself and want to get better. She actually fed herself successfully with no shaking (or choking), and talked normally about what she wanted and understands where she is and why today which was her first day of hospice. Basically did better than she's done all weekend, and it was her first day without being on all her medicine in months... go figure. Your right though, the brain is a funny thing and I'm finding out there are a lot of unknowns about medications and Alzheimer/dementia in general. Thanks for your thoughts on the matter. We'll see how tomorrow goes; hopefully I can get someone to be a little more open about things or get some advice on alternatives aside from Hospice and general Nursing Homes. Home care would be ideal, but we can't afford 24 hour care for very long as it's extremely expensive.


 My father is 72 years old. For a little while he was having some memory problems. In 6 weeks he has gone from driving and doing normal household things to being placed in hospital and declared mentally incompetent. He can no longer walk or feed himself, and has to wear a diaper. We are now waiting for a nursing home for him. The Drs are all puzzled as to why he has declined so fast. He was diagnosed with frontal lobe Alzheimer's 3 weeks ago. He doesn't even know his wife or any of us, his kids, anymore.


 My father passed away on August 25 2013. Apparently the brain disease he had was so rare that his brain has been sent to Ottawa, Canada and hi body had to be cremated.


 To AdrockTN .... Sorry to hear you are going thru this and watching a rapid decline in your grandmother. Could it be ... the passing of your grandfather a month ago has triggered the rapid decline of his partner in life? My Mother has had dementia for an unknown amount of years, but it was officially diagnosed close to three years ago. I believe she is going thru the stages of dementia in more of a normal timeframe .. that is, over a fairly long period of time. Changes of medication, however, have seemed to have started physical changes in her - the latest one of being confined to a wheelchair nearly all of the time. I wish the best for her ....... and for you and yours. Rob


 Welcome to Healing well! I think some better hospice staff would be better, personally. I noticed with my Gma, she declined rapidly, had a swing uphill and knew everyone talking and saying good bye, then declined more rapidly and passed on. Hang in there, hugss


 ""Without going into the whole thing I was wondering how quickly people can go from walking to being bedbound as my grandmother has gone from being able to go to the bathroom, walk, and feed herself to needing assistance with everything including eating in drinking in about 3 weeks."" This pretty much described my FIL just last January. He was living by himself, seemingly taking decent care of himself. He came to live with us in January and in 3 months he declined so quickly that he passed in March. It shocked the nurses, doctors were in denial, and Hospice was surprised as well. It was like once he knew we were there to care for him as much as was needed, he let go. If they fall and hit their head, it can accelerate the disease, so can medication changes, nutritional issues and more.


 All I can say is the brain is a funny thing. I saw my mother-in-law decline that quickly, however my Mom has had a rather slow decline. My mother in law had heart problems as well, so I think that she may not have been getting a lot of oxygen, which could have been a factor. We are all so different! My Mother and Father both graduated out of Hospice a couple of time, and they are a fantastic organization. Unfortunately my Dad passed about two years ago, but they were with us all the way. Take care and good luck with your grandmother. Please let us know how things are going.


 I understand about Hospice. The first agency was not a good one -- the next was fabulous. If you are in the states, you have the option to choose which Hospice agency you would like. I didn't know that until someone I knew told me! And yes, in home care is insanely expensive, and I didn't think my Mom was getting the stimulation or nutrition she needed. She's doing so much better in the memory care. My parents Hospice was done at home -- sounds like they are doing it in her room at a facility? Fortunately my Mom does not take any meds (never really has) but my friend cut her Mom's meds and she is doing very well -- go figure. Sometimes I think we overmedicate people. Take care, keep us updated.


 Oh gosh Bodhran, that is very hard. I'm so sorry about your Father. My mother in law was never diagnosed with Alzheimers, but she failed rather quickly as well; no one was ever sure why except she had a lot of heart problems. Welcome to the forum, so glad you joined. Take care and hugs.


 bodhran, I'm so sorry to hear that. Shocking speed of whatever it turns out to be. Goodness, I lost my father to Alzheimers, but the process took about 15 years from age 73 to 88. To see that happen in a matter of weeks is very sad. I'm sure this is a difficult time for your family. When you find out the cause please let us know what it was. Take care


 My last 2 years before I remarried and my body went down, I cared for an old couple. He had Alz. a was 82. She was able to walk with a cane and wall walk in her house. she was 80. I shared her care on a week own and a week off job. Great money but very.exhausting. He passed after I was there 6 mo. It was so sad they loved each other so much. She fell in love with me right away, but detested the other caregiver was cold as a fish. I left on a monday morning as usual with my week off. She had a doc. apt that week so she was taken in her own car by the other lady. That was the first time she had been given zanax. When I got back the following monday morning she was in bed and just grabbed me crying to take care of her. I questioned the other gal and she gave her 1/2 mg 4 times a day. She just stayed in her bed flat down and coughing and choking. I called her son and then call 911. I spent the whole next week around the clock with her but growing weaker and her coughing just terrible. I asked why she had been put on zanax? I swear to god it killed her. I was gone that whole week and the other gal just kept her down with the zanax. She had been up to her beauty shop and had nails done too. We went to eat out and I took her to walmart. She had so much fun...... in one week of her flat on her back, wasnt getting up for a bath nor dressing her. I knew I had to be so careful. There were 5 grown children and none of them cared a bit. I was just sick over it...i called them all one morning to tell them they needed to get there to see her because I could tell that she wouldnt last the day. One of them made it and I was with her holding her. Medicines kill more people. She had been over drugged and died a week in the hosp. Tell me, what would yall have done? I knew it was just better to just walk away and collect my last check. life is so hard. She was killed by medicine I believe. i miss my little Ms.Josephine.


 AdrockTN ....... I think a few said it already ..... it varies so much and maybe there just isn't a typical time period. I just noticed that yesterday in my Mother. Her hands are becoming so clumsy in the last few weeks. And her legs became nearly useless over the past several months. It's been since last winter that she was able to use a walker. Wheelchair only now!!! It's sad ... our hands are helpless ... and it's painful to watch the degeneration of a loved one. Peace Rob


 I am brand new to alzheimers disease but reading what you wrote made me want to share the sudden loss of motor skills we had..My husband went to bed one night with no clue he would wake up in the morning and not be able to hold a glass or a fork and his walk is now more of a shuffle he drags his feet..Our Dr. said he has Lewy Body Dementia...."
Husband,"Hi, I'm new here. My husband has alzheimers. He had trouble with his memory for years now but was just little things that would forget. Then over 2 years ago he had a mini stroke and things got worse from there and is still getting worse. He still knows me but has had episodes where he forgets we are married. He gets to thinking he needs to go home when he is home. A couple of months ago he kept doing this and I finally one night got him into the car and took him ""home"" he seemed to be satisfied with that. I had to do it 6 times within a week He had some agitation that was hard to deal with but his dr finally prescribed a med to control that He has been getting up in the night and getting dressed thinking it is time to get up. I dont' get much sleep. I am looking into putting him into an adult family home. I do have a caregiver that comes four times a week and one on sundays which has helped but it's getting harder to deal with him when no one else is here Thanks for listening Sophiekat Post Edited (Sophiekat) : 1/13/2014 3:28:42 PM (GMT-7)","Hi Rob and Gizmo, I do take breaks as often as the caregiver is here. I do realize it's the alzheimers and not really him doing all these things. It's just heartbreaking to see my loving husband going down hill like this. We've had a wonderful marriage. God has truly blessed us. Yes, caregiving is expensive. The VA is paying for the caregiving here at home, but will have to get medicaid for an adult family home or nursing home. Sophiekat


 Hello ........ I have a similar situation with my mother, but I live a 40-mile roundtrip away from her home (or former home since it is now sold). I can imagine how exhausting it must be even with a part-time caregiver, at least for most of the past two years. My mothers demetia (so similar to alzheimers) was diagnosed around Easter of 2011, but it's clear now she had been fading for many years prior - and with the help of way too much alcohol for decades. She did have a full-time live-in caregiver for 15-months - expensive but needed .... as I am battling advanced cancer myself. She went thru the night fears ... and wandering thru the house - and once outside to a neighbors at 3am. She's called the police once and attempted it one other time - thinking someone was stalking her in her own home in the middle of the night. As it turns out, she did have more than one mini-stroke ... the third one sending her to the hospital - which then led to the hospital psychiatrist saying she cannot go back home unless she was under the full-time care of an RN. Impossible in costs! So she started in an Assisted Living Home - for Dementia and Parkinsons - in September of 2012. As you may know, there is a tremendous difference between Assisted Living and a Nursing Home. I looked at both ... several different ones. She has been there for 16-months so far. As you might know, either are very expensive. I had to sell her home last Summer. It was vacant for close to one year - with taxes, insurance and minimum utilities paid + grass-cutting. So, it cost $6k just to sit there - and she will never return to her home. She's 96 now and the dementia keeps getting worse. Now that the house had been sold, there is enough money to keep her at that home for close to 3-more years ... before she has to go to a medicaid nursing home ... a terrible alternative. As you do your research, you may be surprised how expensive either type of home is. But then, so is having a full-time caregiver in a house she was paying for. In fact, that was slightly more money living in her own home. Whatever you do .......... you must take some breaks away from all the depression that this viscious disease loads onto you. Your husband doesn't mean anything he's doing ..... it's this disease. Please remember that. Rob & Gizmo


 This is truly heartbreaking, Sophie. Bless you for honoring your vows and becoming your husband's caretaker as his illness progressed. I'm sure it's a tremendous task at times and even though you have breaks, your mind probably isn't far away. I pray you'll have complete confidence when the time comes to transfer the bulk of his care to a facility. The grief and guilt you're experiencing sound completely natural as no couple wants to go through this transition. My mom's dementia became more evident after my dad passed and she is in a wonderful assisted living place with regular meals, companionship, crafts, etc. Because it's a small town, friends and relatives give her regular outings. I don't get to visit often and phone calls often devolve into her childhood memories or confusion about her location. Though written for a married couple, a book that helped me was ""A Promise Kept"" by Robertson McQuilkin. I'm sure a library has it as it came out in 1998. Wishing you peace and rest and dear friends to journey with you. Thanks for giving us a glimpse into your struggle. <<hugs>>"

 Kinda feel the same way too. I often post things and end up talking to myself. It's uncomfortable and feel ignored.


 It's not your fault. Yes you're right that there is not much activity on here. People read it but I wish they would give their 2 cents too. It would be much more informative and happening that way.

Mom passed away,"Got an email from my sister on Monday morning that Mom had really taken a turn for the worst. I drove to the Bay Area, and got there about 3:00 pm, and she was in an agitated state so the hospice nurse started the morphine. She is now at peace, and sitting with my Dad whom she missed so much since his passing two years ago. We were fortunate to have both my parents with us for such a long time; Mom was going to be 85, and Dad was 86.

 Lonie, I'm so sorry for this, the final loss. But I'm celebrating for your mother, who will never suffer again. May you find peace just as she has, knowing you did all that was possible for her.


 Hello Carol ..... I guess it was good that it seemed to be fairly quick. It does seem that you are at peace with your Mom now being able to be with your Dad. Bless you. Rob and Giz


 Lonie, I am so sorry to hear about you Mom. It's so difficult to lose your parents. She is now happy and healthy and with loved ones. She does sound like she was an amazing woman. I'm sure you have many cherished memories. Sherrine


 Dear Lonie, May The Lord surround you with all that is needed to manage life and give u strength thru this time of struggle. Bless u & UR family. She will always be in UR heart, no one can take ur memories of her. They will be a part of UR life forever. As she always held you dear to her heart in life as she will in death.

 so so sorry. My mom is my world. I don't even want to think of that day.


 I'm so sorry about your mom, Lonie. It's good to know that she's now at peace and with your dad. I'm glad you have loving thoughts to comfort you. Lanie


 Thank you Lanie and Red, your kind thoughts mean so much.


 Thanks Kitt for your kind words. She definitely is an angel. Her last words were ""thank you"" to the nurses.


 Thank you Judy; she definitely was loved and the four children she brought into this world were with her when she left. She and my father left a legacy of a huge loving family.


 Thank you Rob. How are you feeling today?


 My deepest sympathies to you and your family, Lonie. What wonderful memories you must have that you can share and remember them both by.


 I love HealingWell for the precious people that come to support each other. Thank you so much for all of the kind words, it is so very appreciated, and made me tear up. Mom was a special lady, and all that met her; met a friend. I only hope I can carry on her legacy of the woman she was. Again, thanks so much. You are all amazing people. Carol


 I'm sorry to hear this Lonie. My condolences to you and the family. I'm glad that she's with your dad and peaceful now. UA"
GET MY MOM OUT OF A NURSING HOME,I'm new here and need help. My mother has been having memory trouble for about a year. She lives in another city than me. Her brothers and sister have convinced her to give them POA. they have been very mean to her and she got in her car and drove to a local church and sat there crying. A lady saw her and called the police which after asking her a series of questions determined she needed a psych evaluation. they took her to a behavioral place and later transferred her to a secure unit in a nursing home. Meanwhile her brothers and sisters transferred her car and home into their names and closed out her bank account. My mother is devistated. I am trying to get guardianship of her now. The nursing home tells me that they won't let her leave even if I have the guardianship because it's against doctors orders. This is crap she is not that bad. She only has trouble when she is upset. It is very easy to confuse her. My sister and I live 1 mile apart and we want her to come live at my sisters who is home full time. How can I get her out of there when she has a doctor that won't budge? I live in TX,"Btw, the nursing home is telling you false information. If you get POA, you have every right to pull your mother out of there despite what the doc says.


 Red_34, do you know where i can find that written? I'd like to walk in there with something so I can show I'm not misinformed. My lawyer just keeps telling me one thing at a time and it drives me nuts.


 Holding a person against their (or their guardian's) wishes is considered kidnapping or unlawful imprisonment, depending on the state. You will have no problem taking her out of the nursing home once you have guardianship. If the home is still balking at that point, just call the police to assist you


 Personally, I would contact a lawyer if the brothers and sisters won't allow you to take her out of the nursing home. A lawyer might be able to get the POA transferred to you and will be able to tell you how to go about doing it.


 i already have a lawyer that's working with me on getting the guardianship. it's the nursing home that isn't budging. her brothers and sister will get theirs through the legal system.


 It is not a written law per se but you might want to ask the nursing home for their rules and regulations manaul; but not only do you need the POA but Durable Power of Attorney as well. The DPA allows to you be in charge of the medical aspect in addition to all things related (financial etc - POA) to your mother. Consider the POA and DPA as an extension of yourself. With the POA and DPA, by LAW the nursing home will have to abide by your wishes as long as it is in the best interest of your mother. If they do not abide by your wishes, they can be sued and brought to court once the POA and DPA is in effect. It takes time to makes these things happen so please have patience.


 Please do all of the legal manuevers first - and get her out of the nursing home (if that's really what it is). An attorney may be needed to change the ownership of property back into your mothers control - preferably thru a revocable living trust. In the future, unscrupulous relatives will find it hard to take off with some of her money. Then, at some point, have her evaluated by a doctor. You very well may need a second doctors opinion to get a release - check with an attorney. If it is the early stages of dementia, it could very well work out fine at your sisters house for a few years. But, eventually .... it likely would require a 24/7 trained caregiver ...... and then ultimately a Home for dementia (if that's what it is) .... not a nursing home. My Mother spent the last 16-months of her life - until last week - in an Assisted Living Home for Dementia & Parkinsons. It was very specialized. They were exceptionally good - but in time, it can get expensive. Personally, if there was any way to pressure the people who did this to your Mother - and check with an attorney - but I would consider filing legal charges - or threaten to. It's disgraceful to do that to your Mom. Peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo"
Something to consider for some?,"Hi All, Since my FIL passed from Alz, I've been very concerned with the research that has been on-going with this horrible disease. I just got an email from Science Daily with this article in it and thought it was worth sharing, as it could make a difference for some. ""Omega-3 Dietary Supplements Pass Blood-Brain Barrier"" goo.gl/4zOR5p The first paragraph: ""New research from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that omega-3 fatty acids in dietary supplements can cross the blood brain barrier in people with Alzheimer's disease, affecting known markers for both the disease itself and inflammation. The findings are presented in the Journal of Internal Medicine, and strengthen the evidence that omega-3 may benefit certain forms of this seriously debilitating disease.""", 
Advantage to getting early diagnosis?,"Hi there. I am a 45 year old female. My mother had Alzheimer's and my grandma also had some form of dementia. I have always had a terrible memory and I feel like it is getting even worse as I age. Sometimes I can't quite find the word I'm looking for and it is really frustrating. I also feel like my reaction time is slower. When I answer a question at work it seems to take me longer to ""retrieve"" it out of my brain, KWIM? I'm not saying that I think I have Alzheimer's right now, but given my family history, what things would you all suggest I do? I haven't thought about it much honestly, but I am reading that a lot of people get it in their 50's. Thanks for any information you can give me!",As far as i have been told and researched nothing can or will prevent it. It is most common when hereditary and early onset diagnosis may provide more effective treatment. Wish you the best.
Wife received preliminary diagnosis of AD or frontotemporal dementia,"Got this diagnosis last week pending PET scan and results of lumbar (already saw shrinkage on left side from MRI). She is 59, and presents with inability at times to find words. No memory or personality issues. I have been researching intensively and believe that primary progressive aphasia- log openic best fit the symptoms. I was amazed at how little there is out there regarding potential treatment. Thus far I have obtained lions mane, phosphaticlylserine, vit. E, and CoQ10 to start her out. Her specialist put her immediately on donepezil, stating she did not think it was AD, but wanted to initiate anyway just in case. I am finding that there is confusion in discussions between AD, frontotemporal and aphasia. She has no cognitive disabilities/memory issues, multi tasks and runs a business. I was devastated to see the preliminary diagnosis, and the diverse opinions on progression and life expectancy. Any input on this, experiences, medication etc would be greatly appreciated. We have been together for 40 years and I want to do everything I can for her. I recently also read a study that cannabis may be beneficial. We next see her doctor in a couple of weeks, and I want to be fully prepared. Thanks","Thanks Lonnie. She is seeing a doctor who specializes in this are. I continue to research.


 Hello ...... First - consult with the right type of doctor. And bring plenty of questions. Very good that you're researching as much as you are. My Mother, who recently passed of complications of Dementia, started showing some effects of reduced brain activity possibly as long as 15-years ago. When she passed, she was 95-years old. Please feel comfortable with her doctor - and trust his/her advice. And don't be afraid to get a second opinion - if needed! Peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo


 Good day, Lex Luther. I think the research for AD is getting better, but as with any disease, it's tough to find the exact meds or diagnosis because we are all so different. I have Ulcerative Colitis and for the last ten years, it's been a series of different meds, foods etc. that I've had to experiment with to find the right combination that put me into a remission. Does her current doctor specialize in geriatric/alzheimer's care? If not, you might want to find a doctor that does. Your wife is fortunate to have you as an advocate for her. Research and more research is your best bet -- go to her doctor as you planned...informed! Let us know how her appointment is, and of course, ask any questions you might have.


 How is her gut health? Seems more and more is being tied to how the symbiosis of the gut relates to brain health. It is never too late. EPA/dha does wonders. So does a turn around of diet. Gluten fogs brains. Get rid of gluten and you have eliminated a huge problem - it destroys many a lining, too. A good probiotic. Fermented *raw, foods; veggies, kraut - does wonders for gut. I like cooling inflammation blog. And read Chris Kresser. The right type and amount of B vitamins *go methyl. Cheap B12 is cyanide. No one needs THAT! Vinpocetine. Amino Acids. No more fluoride. Chlorine. No more aluminum. Volvic water helps detox aluminum out of cells, I have read. (Check for heavy metal? MTHFR mutations? Anemia? VITAMIN D3 !!!!) I am 58 and worried about this. I have just begun my brain heal regimen. Been organic since 05 and Gluten free 09. Healed my migraines, Peptic ulcer disease, GERD/IBS, chronic sinus issues, multinodular goiter with drastic diet change. Juices, raw fermented veggies. Organic everything. Even went into researching EARTHING/GROUNDING. Protection against smart meters. NO cordless phones in my home. NO microwave. NO wifi. NO cable tv. NO computer in bedrooms. Use steterizers. Painted wall with black carbon paint on meter wall. Whatever I can do - I will. I also play games, blog, and want to take Italian class. My exercise is a mini trampoline in the living room.

Namenda dosage,"My mother has been taking 20mg Namenda for the past 6 years. She takes 10mg in the morning and 10mg before bed. I can't really say it's helping but when I tried to wean her off of it once she just got worse so I had to continue. Yesterday I decided to give the evening dose in the afternoon to have one less pill for her take in the evening. The result of that was that she stayed very sleepy and was dragging her leg to walk. However, later in the afternoon she became very aware of what I asked of her and talked quite a bit. Has anyone experienced this? I thought 20mg in a day can be however you want to take it but it looks like they are too close together and may be an overload for her. But then again I can't explain why she was so with it later on.","That's ok. To be on the safe side my mom is taking it morning and night to give more time between each dose. Sometimes I wonder if it's doing her more harm than good.


 It's now 2 weeks later and she's now very weak in the legs and cannot stand or walk on her own. I don't know what to make of this. 1st week she was great and flexible and now it's total opposite. Does this mean she needs the full dosage of 20mg a day after all? How to explain the great light as air body functions on the first week after the decrease but losing that mobility in the 2nd week? Last night I increased it back. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. My mom's doctor thought the drug is useless for her but maybe she is so depended on it now that she needs to stay on it because her body craves it now. Anyone have the same situation?


 I too would like the link that Bella33 requested. Thanks. berta33


 My mom takes 10mg morning and night = 20mg total. Her doctor said the drug shouldn't do much after so many years which was why he thought my mom should go off of it and stop the side effects which could have been sleepiness. My mom is better off on it. Maybe she's hooked. I don't know.


 Yeah my mom is staying on Namenda but she's hallucinating and acting all high a lot. That's from taking Stalevo crushed but that's another story.


 I'm sorry, I just seen your post (I was away on vacation). I can't really comment because when my Gma was on Namenda, they gave it to her at the assisted living center on a regular schedule. Perhaps you can ask a pharmacist? Or her doctor the next time you see him/her?


 Hello folks, It's 1 year later and I had decided to again decrease Namenda. My mom's doctor gave the ok and said at her stage of life the drug probably isn't doing much even if it was working before. It's been a week of 5mg morning and night and she's so much more awake and animated. This drug really sucks the life out of people. I wonder if others have had the same experience. My poor mom was on it for 7 whole years. I am hoping to slowly wean her off completely. I don't want to shock her system so easy does it.


 TheProofUneed said... wow... All it will do is keep her in a stupor. I will pass this info to you and you can do as you please with it... According Alzheimer's is a physicians caused disease and it can be reversed... Before you roll your eyes... Keep this in mind... The cost of this... $20.00 a month at best. Now if it took several months to see any results... I would probably roll my eyes also... HOWEVER.. you'll see noticeable differences with in several weeks... If you're interested in actually hearing it for yourself... I will send you the link as your not allowed to add links from here. * and neither is skirting the rules (deleted more contacts) I want to know the link to this please!!!


 Uh... i didn't request the link because it looks like a scam.


 Namenda has helped my mother, as is the case that no one person is the same because it did not help my father at all. I have no plans to take my mother off of it. The weird dreams or any other side effects can be helped with other meds. Right now my mother is also on 15 mg of Aricept and 1000 of Depakote. Together these starve off symptoms of dementia without seeing the other side effects mentioned. I had to put my mom in a Behavioral Hospital for dementia patients to get her on the depakote. She had become hard to deal with and physical in altercations. But the depakote evened out her mood and made her extremely easy to work with and more happy in the long run. Some hallucinations are harmless. I guess it depends on whether side effects are too negative on whether to wean off or not. Right now I have no intention of taking her off any of the meds."
Lewy Body Dementia,My husband was diagnosed with LBD this past week. He had been showing signs of memory loss for the past couple of years nothing really serious so we just chalked it off to old age(74) we were not really too worried about it. His primary Dr. had sent us to a nero dr. a couple yrs ago who felt it was nothing to worry about either so we just rolled with the forgetfullness..about 5 weeks ago his legs and feet starting swelling and there was a sudden rise in his blood pressure. I took him to the dr. who changes his B/P meds the swelling went down but the B/P continued to be in the 200's so I took him back to the dr. and he ordered a CBC which came back showing kidney failure so the dr. sent us to a kidney dr. who again changed his B/P meds. I noticed within a couple of days his speech was slurred and he started having really strange behaviors like seeing things that were not there and what I called night terrors. He would get out of bed at 3:00am wandering the house and then wake me up with crazy stories that he had been kidnapped and held against his will by neighbors and he had been gone for days but was finally able to escape thew a small window and find his way home. Then he suddenly lost his motor skills and I called the Dr. back who ordered another CBC and this time he was in kidney failure..They admitted him to the hosip. and thankfully were able to bring his kidney function back and cure a UT infection. They saw him experience some of these night terrors in the hosip. and at 1st thought he was suffering from Uremia but after a week of the infection being gone and a CT scan of his head they said it was LBD. I brought him home the night before Thankgiving and he has had a few moments clarity but not very much. He seems more paranoid and his short term memory is completely gone. He is seeing things that are not there and very confused. I had never heard of this disease until last week and would like to see if anyone can help me to better understand what I am dealing with. Thank you....,"So sorry your husband is going through this, and you, too. I wish I had something specific to offer as far as LBD goes but I'm unfamiliar with it. It sounds like you're an amazing source of support to him and I wish you all the best. I'll be rooting for you in the coming days. Sending along a hug!


 5yrsout, welcome to the forum. It sounds like you have a lot going on right now with your husband. Being a caregiver is a tough job. I don't know too much about LBD, but I found this website that might help you -- it is specifically for caregivers of lbda patients. http://community.lbda.org/forum/ Good luck and I hope this helps.


 Thank you for your comments...I too know very little about this disease but thanks to the internet I have been able to find out more about it...I found a family who's Mother had it and they did a journal from the day of her diagnosis until her passing..I read this and then spoke with our Dr. who said it was right on what we can expect....This disease not only takes the mind but the body too and the worst part is there is so little known about it and its under diagnosed very often...I hope and pray we can find a way to help all people with these type of diseases...."
New to this and need some advice,"Hello, I'm here because I don't know where to start. I'm 35 years old and recently became a new mom. I was living across the country and when I was pregnant decided to move back. My father is 75, always had a bad memory and fell about 6 yrs ago buffing a floor and had a serious concussion, and worked as a baggage handler for the airlines for 25+ yrs. Very slowly I've noticed some memory issues, but very minor. Until this past may he had some serious health problems that called for a pretty serious operation. He never had been sic, in fact hadn't had a check up in about 25 yrs up. After the surgery, he was not recovering, he had a urinary tract infection that was causing him to exhibit signs of confusion. That cleared up, and he got better, but had to spend2 weeks ina skilled nursing facility. After this, I notice times where he is in a sort of daze, for a few seconds, andiI think he snaps out of it then tries to cover it up. He will ask me something, I'll answer and the next question is the same. It's not often, but enough. Sometimes he'll get something in his head and ask me about it, and it doesn't make , almost like my answers aren't good enough or what he wants to hear. I planned on addressing this after all the other health issues and surgeries were finished and he just had his last surgery last week and then his brother in law passed away and his sister is in the hospital. My thing is we never really connected emotionally and he still thinks I'm a little kid. Even after I have been his health advocate and fought to get his health straightened out, he'd be dead if it weren't for me. I don't think I can handle talking to him about this and I don't know how to address it with him and be emotionally there for him. His long time friend recently passed away and had alzheimers for 6yrs and it was painful for him to see, so that's all he knows about it. I think a friend or someone else needs to address with him. Does anyone know what I mean? Its very hard to write what I'm feeling about that. Where do I start? I havea place to take him to get testing done, thanks for listening. Any advice will help","Hello LS318 ...... You mentioned you have a place to get testing done. I assume you mean testing for either alzheimers or dementia - and I would guess a psychologist or similar diagnostic doctor would be involved with the testing. After you find out what the memory problem likely is, I would ask that doctor if there are any sources the doctor would recommend for telling your Father about the disease - video or otherwise. Maybe .... it would be possible for a medical person to tell your Father - if he has one that he trusts! Proper diagnosis is first. My Mother just recently (less than a month go) passed away from the end conditions of Dementia. The dementia, as well as, alzheimers is typically a disease spread over a long timeframe ... and is not cureable. My Mother had it and hid it for years before it was diagnosed. Once it was diagnosed, it was already in advancing stages. The doctor refused her release from the hospital to go home - unless she had 24/7 care. So for the next 15-months, she did live at home with a fulltime caregiver service. There came a point with her halucinations that she was back in the hospital - this time under the care of a psychiatrist for a month. Upon being released, the doctor said she would not be allowed to go home - even with a 24/7 caregiver. She now needed some care by an RN nurse. So she then went into an Assissted Living Home - specializing in Dementia and Parkinsons. She was ther for 16-months until she passed in January. She was on Hospice for about her last 5-weeks while in the Assisted Living Home. It is a very difficult thing to watch a loved one slowly deteriorate. I think initially, your Father will be sensitive to how he is told and by whom, if it is one of the memory diseases. And that may continue as he gets mentally worse. I think that depends on the person individually. It is a very good idea to read as much as possible about it ..... BUT only after you know what IT is! So the diagnosis is so important. By the way, my Mother was lucky enough not to have any major operations in her whole life - or cancer or any other major illness. My guess is that the Dementia may have started 10-years or longer ago! One other thought - there might be a social worker thru a doctors office or hospital that could talk to your father after the diagnosis. It might be the best type of person to explain to him what would need to be told. Peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo


 To LS318 New member/ [ i.e. to the person who yesterday posted on this website and asked about how to address father's memory loss....----] I hope the following information will help: 1 ) here is an article about how to talk to a parent about Alzheimer's. http://www.napsnet.com/pdf_archive/30/62953.pdf 2) Also, keep in mind that, pertaining to Alzheimer's treatment, there is a traditional medicine/western medicine approach which involves various medications [but the medications do not cure Alzheimer's] and there is also an alternative medicine approach to Alzheimer's which involves things such as [for example] the information in the Cayce readings, chiropractic, sleeping on temper pedic neck support pillow, vitamin therapy, colonics, and also more recently includes the use of coconut oil such as ""LouAnna coconut oil"" for cases of Alzheimer's disease / i.e. see the work of Dr. Mary Newport, her husband had Alzheimer's disease and she gave him the coconut oil and, if I understood correctly, his consumption of the coconut oil reportedly reversed his Alzheimer's symptoms and cured him. See the following websites: http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130331/ARTICLES/130339979 http://edgarcaycehouston.org/Alzheimer's-Dementia.html http://www.coconutketones.com/ Good luck to you. God bless. Pray and remember that miracles can happen."
Day & Night clock needed - any ideas?,Hi everyone. I care for my Dad and I have been looking and trying to figure out some sort of day and night visual clock as dad gets up at 7pm thinking it is 7am (especially during daylight savings time) and has his shower and takes his morning meds etc at 7pm! I am aware of a digital photo frame which displays 'Monday morning' or 'Monday evening' etc but this would not work for my dad as firstly he needs glasses and would not think to put glasses on to read the clock through the night. Also he is starting to have difficult recognising words - I recently noticed he gets a bit scrambled up when he is writing down any grocery items. Has anyone else seen or used any other suitable products? Thanks.,"That is pretty nifty! Thanks for sharing Carol! :)


 How about this one? http://www.clairmontplc.com/page.php?42


 we have two clocks at our site www.clocksforalzheimers.com the round one is simple clock where the day and date are not a factor the key thing to keep in mind is that they should look like clocks otherwise they may not be seen as a time piece hope these help john


 doliver said... I found exactly what my dad needs and it has been working very well. Thanks for all your replies. I purchases a cheap android tablet device and bought an app called zeezap from google play. It is a day night visual dementia clock. Has been fantastic and he hasnt got up through the night since we started using it. What a wonderful product, Doliver!!! Thanks so much for coming back to show us what you decided to use!! I wish I had found this when my FIL was still living!


 My Mom has a huge digital display with day, date, and time and it's been working fairly well, but now she's getting a little more confused. I just googled clocks for Alzheimer's and this one came up -- it looks like something that might work well for those in an advanced confused stage.... http://www.day-clock.com/usa/day-clock.html Hope this helps. Carol


 Thanks for that. Unfortunately I have tried this and as it is all text it doesn't really work for someone who wears glasses (and doesn't put them on when they wake before they get in the shower). I am looking for something with a visual image or something. But thanks heaps.


 This is what my Mom has: http://free-alzheimers-support.com/wordpress/2010/08/watches-clocks-calendars-digital/ But that being said...she called the other day to wish me a happy birthday. She said she knew the date was the 28th, but she didn't know what month it was and told me that she gets so confused. Regardless, it's always so sweet to hear her voice, and she tried so hard...and I'm amazed that she dialed the phone.

 It really sounds like I am in the exact same position. My father in law just got up at 10:00 after going to bed at 8:30. He had just showered and when he got up he said that he was sorry that he had overslept. I told him that he had not overslept because it was ten at night. I will have to look into the android tablet and zeezap. I hope it helps here."

alzheimers my mother and me,"Hi everyone, I know many of you are dealing with heavy issues and want to thank you for taking time to read mine. My mother was diagnosed several years ago and is now unable to care for herself in any way. Her new doctor however is doubting her diagnosis because my mom is only 56. We must wait until January to see a new specialist now. One issue I'm having is that this early Alzheimer's is genetic. She has it, her father had it, and his mother had it. My and my 3 boys are the only ones at the end of that line. I've gotten no answers because my grandmother being so upset over her daughter refuses to discuss with me or the doctor my chances. I know that this seems selfish but from what I've learned its very rare, but high chances if a parent has the genen which we have seen in the last 3 generation, at least 1 kid got it. In that straight line of got it I'm the last one before my kids. If I have one of my kids most likely will too. Its so scary because I've been watching this for years, and know it can start between 30 and 55. I am 32, and my youngest boy is 2. I'm afraid.","Hello ... Please don't let your concern overwhelm you. I think I understand your concern, and it would seem certain that medication improvements keep coming - but try to place your concerns of a possible future negative into a perspective that doesn't interfere with living today. While it is a possibility, it is not a diagnosis. My Mother is in a well-run assisted living home for Dimentia, and my Grandmother (her mother) was in a horrible Nursing Home (20+ years prior) with Alzheimers. Just the concept of care ... for Dimentia and Alzheimers has changed a great deal in barely one generation. I expect the types of medication have changed as well. In my personal health issues, I have not worried about becoming a dimentia patient. But ... I am in a battle (10-years so far) with Prostate Cancer, Kidney failure because of the cancer growth (2-years+) and COPD for the past 5-years +. I have tried to find a history of prostate cancer in my family, and I cannot find it! It could be ... that one generation back people were dying of prostate cancer, but the cause of death was either unknown or mis-diagnosed. It seems to have little history. But, the treatments are constantly changing ... so hope if still alive!!!! The oral chemo I just started two weeks ago was just passed by the FDA just 11-months ago ... and yet, that treatment now seems to be a pretty common treatment for advanced prostate cancer. The moral of the story ......... hope ....... whether religious or not, is a key in dealing with so many negatives in life. You and your sons have much time for hope for new procedures, medications and diagnosis. Enjoy your boys and your life today ... and hope for tomorrow.


 Hi thebrothersmother, and welcome to the forum. I'm sorry you are dealing with the unknown, it's very scary isn't it? I have seen both my Mother and Mother in Law fall to Alzheimers, so I know how traumatic it is to wonder if we will be the recipient of this wonderful disease. I already deal with Ulcerative Colitis, so who knows what is down the pike? Our scientists and medical field have made such great strides in medicine within the last 20 years, so I'm hoping that they will find a test or medication to help us with Alzheimers. I know you also worry about you and your children getting early onset and of course rightfully so since you've seen it first hand. I wish you the best, and remember to try and take one day at a time. Take care, and again, welcome to the forum and thank you for sharing."
Moving Mom into an assisted living facility,"Last August I brought mom from the east coast to live with us. I found a rental that would accommodate her and my four teenagers and we thought we would be able to stay here for three or four years. Our landlord recently let us know that he is going to sell his property and we have to be out. I will not be able to find another place to accommodate us again so I have been looking for an assisted living place for my mom. She has early onset Alzheimer's, is 65 and is still high functioning. I help her with her meds, food, and financials. She dresses herself and has no incontinence issues, helps around the house and does not wander ( she is too afraid to go out without us since she is not familiar with the area). The Assisted Living place I found is wonderful and feels like a community. I told her the other day I found an apartment for her to go and live in and she freaked out. Threatened to hang her self, said she absolutly will not go and tried to take off in her car but luckily my husband had already disconnected her battery. We did not get much sleep that night cuz we had no idea what she would do. She was up all night pacing, picking at her face and nails. I know she sis scared and we tried to reassure her that we are still going to there for her but nothing helped. The next day my husband tried to calm her again because she thought I was going to tie her up and send her to a sanitarium. He finally told her that is was still possible that she could come with us and that calmed her, so we have just left it at that. We are scheduled to take a tour of the facility in a few days and I know she will not like but she has to go there. My questions are: Should I put her in respite care and then move her stuff in? Should I have her help me move her stuff? I know that she will not go willing or easily, but how do I minimize the trauma for either one of us? Thanks for any suggestions! Carrie","We moved my mom into assisted living two years ago and we were so stressed out about how she would react. We took her there for a visit and after being there for about 30 minutes and talking to the administrator, my mom turned to us and said ""when can I move in?"" She was so excited. Believe me, we NEVER expected that kind of response. She has been there two years and loves it. She feels very safe and happy (her words). She was diagnosed with Alz 8 years ago and continues to be high functioning...she is 89 years old. Fingers crossed that things go as well for your mom...it isn't easy... Miriam


 My heart goes out to you Stella. I'm sorry you have to make this decision. It's a rough and tough call.


 Stella, feel free to come back anytime with any concerns or questions you may have.


 In few assisted facilities, if patient opts for private room,one of the family members can also stay with the patient.When I was planning to shift my father to hospice, my mom also decided to stay there with him.


 I hope to never place my mom there, but in the end it may be a reality. She is still highly functioning and all, but some years down the road IDK. Time will tell. I visited my grandmother for years at a facility, played the piano for her, but that far away look in her eyes, and not knowing who i was.... Some advances are being made in the field, and i hope in time that there will be some cure, or anything to help stop the progression. There are links to metals in water and such..and also genetic.


 I don't think I've heard of AD causing neuropathy. Has she had her vitamin levels checked recently? Is she diabetic?


 Those are really good suggestions Angie...thanks for sharing :) I'm sorry to hear about your husband, best wishes for you all.


 What?? That's crazy! Who did you talk to that said you couldn't see her for a week?


 I've never ran into something like that. Normally they want family to come visit to help ease the transition. Sounds a bit fishy to me.


 Sorry but I think those of you advocating contact with loved ones just admitted to an Alzheimer's facility no matter the circumstances are wrong. After two months of trying to home-care for my Alzheimer's diagnosed mother-in-law she was admitted to a wonderful facility last Wednesday. She is high functioning but left alone in her home, which is what she wants even now, she fell and cracked her pelvis. She will not accept ""strangers"" in her home and 24/7 care provided by family, which she hated, was stressing us all beyond endurance. I'm not going into detail about her symptoms and behaviors but if you ask I'll answer. Suffice it to say that she has exhibited EVERY symptom you can think of from aggression to memory lapses to defiance to hiding things to locking us out to you name it! We tried our best to get and employ all of the information and suggestions we could find to no avail. In any case, we took her to see the 15 bed private room facility beforehand and she liked it enough to say that she thought she should ""put her name in."" She also thought that she and her deceased husband had lived there at one time but that's another story. She has a phone with which she calls my wife almost daily to tell her everything from she thinks she's stealing her furniture (We moved her favorite chair, dresser and table into her private room and we have her newspaper delivered.) to wanting to go home, a home that when she was there she many times didn't recognize! Contrary to what is said here we are NOT going to visit until,she acclimates a bit more. We're going to give it one to two weeks. We're comfortable with this. In the final analysis each case is different. My mom died at 92 after ten years of dementia. She was similar but different than my mother-in-law. In the final analysis no matter what any advice given advocates, you have to do what YOU think is best for YOUR loved one and YOU! Remember, you count too!


 Mountain Ed ....... I noticed this thread was started three weeks ago - but I just got onto HW 9-days ago - mostly for my Prostate Cancer - but two days ago, checked out the Alzheimers Disease section (for my Mothers severe dimentia). My Mom has been in an Assisted Living place for 9-months now ... and that was after going for 15-months of living at home with 24/7 caregiver help. The placements (both of them) were doctor ordered. While my Mother was not the most sociable in the old neighborhood - and somewhat of a ""loner"", her experience at this Home for Dimentia Care has been good. She loves the entertainment that comes in once or twice a week and the Bingo games several times a week. If there was anything that the home you are considering does, that might excite your Mother, it sounds like a good tactic to use to create a positive feeling after visiting the home. Good luck ... keep any guilt at bay ... hope you find a place she loves!


 Hello Carrie, welcome to Healingwell. You're in a tough situation and I feel for you. It is never easy to move a loved one to assisted living, especially if they have Alzheimer's. They just don't understand and unfortunately they may never. However, you have to do what is best for everyone involved. It is good you are taking her for a tour of the facility. To help with the transition, it may help to have her help with the moving. And emphasize repeatedly that this is the best for everyone. But also mention that you will be with her thru the whole process. It might also help to reassure her that you will be there to see her every chance you get. When they move to unfamiliar surroundings, they get confused and scared - quite understandable! But it is VERY important for you to be there with her every chance. Visit several times a day, if you can at least until she feels comfortable or at ease. These facilities are designed to help ease the transition as well. I found that when I had to put my Gma in an assisted living center, that if I found one person that she liked - to have that person spend more one on one time with her, that it helped tremendously. Luckily it was the director of the facility. It's going to be tough to put your mom thru this, but hopefully she will adjust quickly. But I can not emphasize enough that it is highly important that you see her every day until she is adequately adjusted. Best wishes and I hope everything turns out okay.


 Both my parents, in their eighties, are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. My mother was diagnosed first and wanted to go into assisted living almost immediately so she wouldn't be a burden to us. Since her balance was shaky and access to the house was poor, we agreed. She seems happy there. My father would rather stay at home, but his incontinence issues are making it very difficult for me to care for him, even with disposables and pads. He's getting much worse about taking his medication and his personal care is poor, even with my help. I have a feeling the day is coming soon when he'll need to join Mom at the home. I wish I knew how to make this happen with the least distress to him. Apart from pointing out that Mom is there, I'm not sure how to handle it, so I understand your dilemma, Carrie. I could use a few suggestions myself! Good luck!


 Thanks, Sherry. It is comforting to know people here understand.


 Hi Stella; on each coast we have the same situation; Mom's are in the almost last stage of Alzheimer's and our Father's are of pretty sound mind, but bodies deteriorating. Both set's of parent's are still in their home with caregivers, but I think it's getting to the point where we all feel the situations are getting dangerous. I have done all I can to keep my parents in their home; alarm system, check on them daily, and caregivers. I too am looking for suggestions to make the transition easier, so I feel your pain. We cry almost every night when we start talking about our parents. These decisions aren't easy are they? I'm so glad I have others to talk to about it. Thanks for being here everyone!


 This is such a tough situation to be in. MY mom had alzheimer's too and we did put her into an assistend living facility. The hardest part at first was convincing her that she could not live alone. She was leaving the toaster oven on all night and forgetting to turn off the stove. She would be driving in her car close to her neighborhood and forget where she was going. It was heartbreaking. I think the most important thing for you to do is to make your mom feel like she is part of the decision making process. Touring the place is a great idea. If she hates it, maybe you could look into some more places so she will feel like she has a choice about which place she goes to. Even if you've already done the leg work and you know this place is best. She might need to see for herself. If she doesn't already realize that she needs extra help, then I would sit her down and talk to her about why your concerned for her welfare, either because of things that are occuring now or the reality of what will be happening as her health continues to decline. I also agree with peeps that you should visit as often as possible.


 Hello All, I am a newbie, finally found a site and happy I did! LOve the inspirational stories and support I am reading here and I thank everyone for their input. Quick question to see if anyone has dealt with this. Jst placed my MIL 2 days ago to a ""facility"" Told her it was temp, for phy rehab for her feet. She is now starting to get ""mean"" to me, the one she has loved forever, and cld her own daughter. I am ok so far, and understanding its not her talkg, Im wondering if Itchy, and numb feet are ever associated with AD? She ws admitted to hosp last wk bc she ws in tears, complaing of painful feet, numbness. Doc said its neuropathy, Im wondering if it could be from her AD, along with anxiety? Thanks!


 I usually don't post here, but in the Hepatisis forum. But I did have to put my 64 year old husband in a nursing home because he was in end stage liver failure and had confusion, forgetfulness from toxic buildup in the blood. Symptoms were much like alzheimers. It was horrifiying to think about putting him in a NH, but I couldn't take care of him anymore. Before the day for him to move, I went and looked at the room and it looked so much like a hospital room I cringed. So the next morning, while he slept, I took most of his wall pictures, blankets, decorated pillows (exotic animals) and make the room look like his office/bedroom. On the outside room door, I put a collage of pictures of him and his life work (elephant trainer). He was so confused as we packed and drove there and when he got there and saw all his stuff, he just kind of melted into the room and smiled and said, ""Here's my room."" All the pictures on the door (I blew them up into 12 X16 inch photos) were a drawing card for other residents and visitors to talk to him (or if he wasn't up to talking he would close his door but could hear people talk about his pictures). These are things that helped us make the transition easier. Plus, I went there about 2 x a day to visit. (It went so much smoother than I had ever imagined.) Hope some of this is helpful as you struggle with such a difficult decision. Angie1953


 My family members just moved my mother with Alzheimer's into a facility. I found out the day before they took her. They had a non-family member take her and no one even told her she wasn't coming home - they told her she was going shopping. The facility says we should not call or visit my mother for a week. I used to call my mother every day and just saw her a few days before this move. She knew me. My heart is breaking to not talk to her and how this move was made. I live 4 hours away. I have been talking to her aid every day to see how she is but I just get that she is ""ok"". I feel I need to talk to my mother. Does anyone agree with this rule of no contact for one week or am I just being selfish?


 The owner of the facility. she said she wants my mother to bond with her staff and that is hard if fmaily members are present. i am heartsick. i am planning on a visit as soon as a week is up. but i desperately want to talk to her and hear in her voice that she is ok. if they disconnect her from me for a week will she even remember me? i want what is best for my mother but i am very confused what that is. i am heartsick...


 Don't allow them to tear apart your family like that. For someone with cognitive issues, the worst thing that can happen is for the people that they know to disappear. You have rights here, please exercise them.


 We had to face this difficult decision and, fortunately, it worked out really well. Mum thought she had gone on holiday to a lovely hotel. That's not to say that there weren't some sleepless nights along the way. One thing that really helped me was a book called 'The Little Girl in the Radiator.' It was given to me by a lovely friend. It's written by an ordinary chap called Martin Slevin and is his account of looking after his mother after she got Alzheimer's. After all the dry and worthy books about dementia that I had read, it was a breath of fresh air. Funny, moving, easy to read and really helpful. It made me realise that all the feelings I was having were normal. Best of luck Mountain Ed."
Newbie,"Well - how do I begin? My husband is 65 - has various serious health issues (Diabetes, Hep C, liver cancer, liver transplant, rare lung fungus-mucormycosis, heart attack, triple bypass surgery, high blood pressure/low blood pressure, fainting spells, now fatigue) - recently diagnosed with early dementia (whatever that means). He's fine during the day - for several months he has what I have 'decided' is Sundowners. He has 21 doctors and it seems since this newest problem has reared it's ugly head - none of them want to address it. I've searched online and can't find anything about people doing fine during the day - and experiencing Sundowners late afternoon/night. He is weaker and weaker by the day, sleeps more and more - yet, none of the doctors can find anything wrong (and believe me - he's at the doctor ALL THE TIME). I sure could use some ideas. Thank you. Pam","I would agree with Red. It is unbelievable the side effects that some medications can cause. If at all possible, I would try to keep a journal and give meds at diferent times, if possible, and then watch for signs, again keeping a journal. With all of your husband's medical issues, I cannot imagine you can keep track without keeping notes. My mom has Alzheimer's/dementia and is now in skilled nursing, on the dementia floor. I visit almost ever day and if I go after 3pm, the change in some of these residents is incredible! It is obviously sundowner's and they do have some form of dementia. In any case, I wish you well, Miriam


 To rcmoonpie ... The medications certainly can have the effect of being tired all of the time. I just got a call this afternoon from my Oncologists office asking me about the side effects of my most recent cancer medication. All I could tell him is ""I""m not sure if my needed afternoon naps the past few days are because of the new cancer med 'Xtandi' just started 13-days ago ... or if it's still the Lupron (hormonal therapy) I have been on for nearly two years now - with the complication of the new medication added""! Regarding ""sundowners"" ... I just had an unpleasant experience with my Mother who is in a home for Dementia patients (for 10-months now) ... and I usually go to see her at 1pm - right after her lunch. Last Saturday, it backfired on me - and she did get nasty and beligerant - first time in a long time. And I guess it can't be explained by ""sundowners"" - but she did just get off of an antibiotic (for 10-days) ... so, here again, the meds may have had something to do with it. It's so complicated! Wishing you well.


 I imagine he's on a lot of medicines? Is it possible that his medicine is causing his Sundowner's symptoms? I know that some medications can effect the older generation differently than the younger so maybe his meds are the problem and it's not dementia at all. Does he take a certain medicine during the afternoon before these ""episodes""?


 I agree with Red too, sometimes meds can do it. Also, being familar with SunDowner's I will say usually nights/days are mixed up. My aunt (may she rest in peace) had that form of dementia, and was extremely worse as sun goes down. It wasn't that all bad during the day, but still was noticed. Like Miriam said, keep a journal, actually everyone should keep a journal. When my gma and aunt passed it actually comforted me in knowing that they were more at peace and didnt have to live with the dementia anymore."
Purpose in life ...... is it important?,"Hello ......... In my opinion, YOU BET IT IS!!! The question or statement of need of a purpose in life - just came from reading a thread by MT Lady with a reply by Bella33. Rather than continuing that thread (which was going in a slightly different direction at that point), I decided to start a new thread! All I can do is imagine that the need for someone like my Mother, a severe dimentia patient, still needs a purpose in life ... but either may not realize it, or more than likely cannot communicate that need. On Saturday, I was over to see her. We talked for a little while - she asked me how I was doing - if my youngest daughter was married yet - and when will she be able to go home. I checked their weekly schedule on the display board, and told her in a half hour, it's time for Bingo! That brought a little glimmer in her eyes! Once the Bingo game started, I sat in at the table she was at - just to look and listen. Very interesting - the facility had a different type of bingo card. Instead of numbers on the card, there were drawings of articles of clothing. So ... the point was for the patient to recognize the article of clothing, then put the marker on that square (in typical bingo fashion). I watched and noticed that my Mother missed 4 different articles of clothing in just one game. All of the patients seemed to be having difficulties - so the observent facilitator changed back to original type of bingo cards for the next game. In that game, Mom got every one - and got them quickly! It was a wise choice by this young facilitator (about 30-years old). I think the point was - the more difficult or challenging game was started - a game that makes you think a bit - and either because of the time of day (mid-afternoon), the temperature of the room (many complaints about it being too cold) or ???? ..... the game was changed to a more recognizable form. Holding everyones interest was most important and was done with the simpler game. In a very small way, maintaining interests within a dimentia patient is helping to maintain a purpose in life ... for someone who has lost almost everything ... even if it's only a Bingo game. I look back now, in my own personal life, and find that a ""sense of purpose"" is incredibly important ... maybe the most important thing left for me to save - as I am battling cancer myself. When I had to stop working two years ago, it is when I began to realize just how important a sense of purpose was. For those that we love, who cannot use their mind in any logical manner, I have to believe that a ""sense of purpose"" is one of their strongest needs! How do you feel?","To Wilmey ..... I hope ""control of he patients"" was not the plan of the ""cold"" facility! Nursing homes do tend to have a reputation of being under-staffed - so hopefully, that was a temporary situation. Your trial of involving your Mother with small daily chores or other things seems to have done a lot of good - and does kind of justify the NEED of a sense of purpose - even in someone afflicted with dimentia. Thanks ... and best wishes!


 That's awesome Gizzy -- my Mom was the same way. Never a joiner, but now she knows all the little stories of everyone (even though some are kind of tale she wove in her mind) and enjoys the group activities. So glad your Mom is feeling more comfortable, and hey, way to go with setting her watch!! Yes, she now has a new purpose!


 Hi Gizzy'n me. In the beginning of the years I took care of my mother, there was so much to do because everything had gone to pot after my dad died, so I was just getting things back in shape. Mom never said anything about it, but then one day she was just sitting in her chair fiddling with her 'stuff,' and out of the blue, and to no one in particular, I heard her say, ""I feel so useless."" After that I involved her in a lot of what I was doing, and let her just do as much as she was able to do. She loved it, and while we worked, we talked and laughed together. I'm with you. I believe everyone needs a purpose to their lives or they just give up and fade away. There isn't any way to measure how anyone feels about the purpose of lack of it in their lives, and many aren't in any position to express how they feel about it. What you said about several of the people with your mother complaining that it was cold struck me. After my mother broke her hip and had to be in the nursing home, I'd found her one day sitting in the hall with many others in there wheel chairs when I'd gone to be with her, and they'd all seem to be sleeping. None of them had covers of any kind on their laps, and none had sweaters on. When I stopped by her chair she looked up at me, and I knew she hadn't been asleep. I asked her if she was cold, and she said, ""YES!"" I had the feeling this was the way the residents were kept under a kind of control.


 It's been 6-weeks ............. That is, since my last post on ""Purpose in life"". Yesterday, when I was over to see Mom, a small group of 8 or 9 were outside with one facilitator. They were in what was called a book club. In reality, a three or four page short story was put together by one of the staff members I guess. And the purpose of the story was in names ... recognizeable and not! By the end of the short story, read to all by the facilitator, each person announced their middle names as an ending to the book club session. My Mother missed much of it because I came, but we both sat down outside close to the group ... because it was such a beautiful day out. I noticed Mom was kind of missing being a part of the group ... and she never was a joiner but more of a loner. I mentioned to her that there were a couple of new faces ... and she mentioned to me all about everyone - good and bad. Slowly ....... she is becoming not only comfortable there, but also feeling like she belongs there. If you will ... a new sense of purpose in life. And just one small thing ..... she set her watch by herself yesterday. Yes, it took a long time ... but all other times I've been there, and she's thought about time - she would ask me ""would you set my watch""? She didn't ask this time. It was difficult for her - mostly because everything on the watch is so small - but she did it! And I know she felt good that she did it!!!! As small as that might be!!!!"
The Journey Continues...the long goodbye,"Hello everyone, I am not new here, just don't come that often. My mom has been on her Alzheimer's/dementia journey now for almost ten years, she was diagnosed July 2003. From what I've read, it probably began up to ten years before her diagnosis and now looking back, some of the strange behaviors make sense. Mom was always an extremely independent woman, very secure, very sure of herself. She left school after 6th grade, she had to, because of Hitler, she is Jewish and Jews were not allowed to be educated in Germany. She was in ten slave labor camps for 2-1/2 years and managed to survive. She met my dad after the war, they left for the US after my sister was born and then went on to have two more girls, me and my other sister. My dad passed away when he was 51, leaving mom at the age of 41 to raise three teenage girls, I was the youngest at 13. Mom got a job and eventually became a department manager at Wards, then managed three departments, with a 6th grade education. She was responsible for hiring her staff, managing and ordering her inventory and taking care of customers and did this for 17 years. She volunteered for several organizations, played cards, and bingo. She was very interested in politics and watched CNN and C Span. Never did I think she would fall victim to dementia and yet she did. She is now 91 years old and only recognizes me and my sisters, on a good day. I feel very fortunate that I found a facility that cares so much for their residents. Believe me, it's not perfect, the staff are not perfect, but being there just about every day, I can see how hard they do try. I tried to care for mom for a year in my home and I became very sick, emotionally as well as physically. I have fibromyalgia, depression and anxiety. My sister then took her for 3-1/2 years, then four years of assisted living and now where she is living, just 5 miles from me. I realize there are some here that wouldn't dream of placing their parents or loved ones in a skilled nursing facility. Sometimes that simply is the best answer and sometimes you are lucky enough to find a good one. Well, not all luck, I really did my homework, for many years. I was just lucky that it happens to be close to my home. I do have one question: Mom remains on Aricept and Namenda, now for ten years. I wonder if the meds are still working? I realize the only way to find out is to take her off of them, but if I do, and she takes a severe decline, and I put her back on them, I was told you cannot regain what was lost. Anyone here have any experience with this? Thanks for listening/reading, Miriam","Hi Bella And thanks so much for responding. I agree with you about dementia, except my mom is VERY aware of her memory loss. She completely isolates herself in her room and refuses to socialize at all with any of the residents. She tells me ""they are a bunch of nuts""...also tells me I put her in an institution, when she is on an alzheimer/dementia floor. She doesn't know the difference between memory loss and mental illness. To her, the residents are mentally ill and she feels she doesn't belong there. On the other hand, she doesn't want others to realize how bad her memory loss is, so she doesn't speak to anyone. I know how ridiculous it sounds. I do believe it is the Namenda and Aricept that is keeping her at this level and I don't even know if I am doing her any favors by keeping her on the medication. I see no quality of life, spending all her waking and sleeping moments in her little room. Staff tries so hard to talk her into coming out and joining into activities but she refuses. The only way she will, and it is rare when she does, is when I go and talk her into going to something and then I have to go with her. And I find it SO depressing, watching all the residents. Most of them are in a later stage than mom is. There is nothing good about dementia, nothing at all. Again, thank you for responding. It would be nice if there were more people that were active in this forum. take care Miriam


 MT Lady ....... Namenda ... is one of the drugs that my Mothers new doctor took her off of late last Fall. She was on it for a little over a year - but this doctor actually believes less medication for a 95-year old is better than more. It seems that the only difference without the meds she was taking is that her occassional nightime episodes have stopped. Of course, no kind of medication will bring back her memory, stop its deterioration or reduce her level of dimentia - but it was surprising that the lack of Namenda actually improved probably the most frightening of her symptoms. The last nightime episode was last August, and it put her into the hospital (from her own home with a live-in caregiver). Her typical episode would be waking up in the middle of the night - then screaming that someone was in her house and trying to kill her. She once left the house and ran over to her neighbors house at 3am ... and once called the police herself ... and the last time, she actually had developed enough trust in the live-in caregiver to call for her. There were three times in a period of a year - not a lot of episodes - but they were horrendously frightening to her. One other thing - from your story of your Mothers history to current reactions - it sounds like she is a very strong-willed person. Mine is - as well. Picture, if you can, a 95-year old who was driving her 20-year old car until 2-years ago - still buying weekly lottery tickets until last August (and hiring a driver or taking a cab to get the tickets) - still wanting to control her money (even though I have been paying all of her bills and handling her taxes and small investments for three years) but understanding next to none of her bills - and refusing to ever go to a nursing home for the past 18-years, since my step-father died. Upon leaving the hospital (first time with any psychiatric help or observation) in May of 2011, her primary doctor said she could not go home without having 24/7 care in her home. I live over 20-miles from her (for the past 23-years) and am fighting several life-threatening illnesses myself - and my house is a two-story with both bedrooms upstairs (impossible for her to climb). So ... a caregiver in her home was the only option ... not to mention there was no way she was going to move in to my house (her own words)! The next 15-months worked well. She had her independance. She was able to boss around the caregiver (and she did like that) - although one of them did quit and had to be replaced. She kept writing the checks for her hairdresser and for the weekly groceries - giving her a sense of purpose and control ... while I kept writing the checks for her utilities, taxes, insurance and other bigger bills. I did get over to her house every week (at least once weekly) to spend some time with her - and called her daily at around 5pm so she knew when to expect a call each day. It worked well for 15-months until her last evening episode which sent her to the hospital for tests and observation. Please note ... those 15-months were expensive from my Mothers account. Between the cost of the caregiver and operating cost of her home + food, insurance, etc. - half of her lifetime savings disappeared. When leaving the hospital the last time (last September) - her doctor, then the staff Psychiatrist said she could no longer live at home - even with a 24/7 caregiver. The caregivers are just not adequately trained - as a registered nurse would be. After walking thru 6 different facilities - from marginally OK to very nice ... I was directed to a facility that specializes in dimentia and parkinsins - only!!! She has been there for the past 9-months and even though she will occassionally still ask ""when will she be going home"" it is a good place for her. You see ... she always has been somewhat of a ""loner""! She never would let any of the neighbors get close to her - even the same for her few close friends! One of the philosophies I really like at her Assisted Living Home is that they will not allow any of the patient residents to sit in their rooms alone (unless of course they are sick). They have a huge program of planned activities daily, they have live-in animals (dogs and/or cats) for therapy and a relaxed atmosphere, and they do have entertainment that comes in 5 or 6 times a month. In good weather, they have one outing a month and provide the transportation and assistance for it. My Mother is virtually always out of her room. She has become a ""bingo addict"" and she loves the entertainment (even if it is just a little corny sometimes). The big screen tv in the family or great room often has DVD's of ""I Love Lucy"" shows or ""The Dean Martin Show"" or others from the 60's and 70's! They have a large but very nicely done Dining Room with table clothed tables and very decent food. I've eaten there twice so far. Now ... this is not cheap, but it is less in cost than paying for a live-in caregiver and the upkeep of a house. For 9-months, I have gone to her house at least weekly for mail, to check the vacant house for any break-ins and to water her few plants. Last Friday, her home was just sadly put on the market. It had to be. She never will return to it ... the rest of her lifetime savings will be gone by next Winter ... and the sale of the house will keep her in this fine facility for another two years beyond that - if she is able. Besides the emotional difficulty of dealing with a parent having dimentia, the costs ultimately have an impact too. Over the past two years, I have done some research in financial assistance. If someone has $20K a year coming in (as my Mother does with SS + a small pension) as income, there are very few government programs available for cost assistance. Medicaid requires that the patients total net worth is no more than 30K - and that includes a house, car, bonds, mutual funds, etc. Once on Medicaid, the government will pay for a nursing home. TRUST ME - you don't want to send her there if at all possible. At the least, they are under-staffed, often dark dingy places - that shout ""this is where you will die""!!@!!! If it's a Medicaid home, it is likely to be that way! I hope there are exceptions! There is another assistance program, but the person has to be either a veteran or the spouse of a deceased veteran. Here again, it is only available to people who have nearly nothing left financially (I think down to their last 30K of total assets). It is up to $1000. a month of cash, and if the person has SS and/or a small pension - as in my Mothers case, she could total by then be bringing in about $3000. per month. Summary ...... when I see the joy on my Mothers face and watch her clapping to an Elvis impersonator performing before 30 or so patients, I know for a moment at least, she is happier there than she ever would be now at home. Same goes for a Bingo game ... she actually has a reputation there of being a good bingo player. For your info ... the name of the place is ""Silverado"" and they do have many facilities in several states. My experience so far in 9-months, is that the caregivers I have talked to do care ... and there is a registered nurse on staff - 24/7! If the day comes for you to make that decision, try to think that this will be for her best interests - and try to find a place that specializes in the care of dimentia. Peace ... and good luck to you ... and yours!


 Thank you for your input...very much appreciated. I may not have been clear in my previous post. My mom currently is in a skilled nursing facility, on a floor for Alzheimer's/dementia. The facility is rated 4 stars out of 5 and has been for the past 10 years. They are considered one of the finest in the northern suburbs of where we live. And, thankfully, they accept Medicaid. They have a very long waiting list for Medicaid. My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's ten years' ago and at the time she asked to live with me, she was so afraid to be alone. Such a strong, independent woman all her life, but to this day she is very aware of her memory loss and it frightened her. So, I cared for her for a year in my home, with the help of a caregiver because I worked full time, but it still made me very sick, physically as well as emotionally. She then went to live with one of my sisters for 3-1/2 years, then went to private pay assisted living, a beautiful place with wonderful care and paid $5,000 a month for almost four years...and ran out of money. During that time, I began the process of filing for public aid...what a nightmare. We still have not hear if she will be accepted, but where she is now took her in with her paying one month's rent, $9,600, and that wiped out her money completely, so now she is public aid pending and living there. She has a private room, which is paramount for her. She could never live with anyone. She was never a social person and for ten years now has completely isolated herself. These places where she has and now lives have activities all day long; she refuses to go. She will go to bingo, but that is it, and she goes to eat her meals in a dining room where she does a little socializing with two people at her table. It is not that she is that high functioning; it is she believes that she is, she views herself as not needing any help when in reality she needs the help of that specific floor. Her room is very small and yet she has no idea where her clothes are. If she isn't prompted to wash up, she doesn't. She definitely needs their help and believe me, I am SO grateful that I was able to get her in this facility as a public aid resident. The staff are truly wonderful, they really care. She has been there almost three months, and I go there almost every day. I make myself known, I want them to know her family is watching. And still, this is so hard, so difficult to watch her decline. Again, thanks for responding, Miriam


 To MT Lady .... It does sound like you hit on a winner with the skilled nursing facility your Mother has been in. From my search for a facility 10-months ago, I found one place that was beautiful - but it was the most expensive of those I checked - and did offer single rooms. I too, felt that Mom would never want to have a roomate, but as time went on, and I found many did not even offer single rooms - I decided to concentrate on a room with one roomate. The difference in cost, at the most expensive place, was close to $2500. per month more for the single room! The expensive place I mentioned above also did have a small amount of beds approved for Medicaid, but as of last August, the waiting list for a Medicaid room was over two years long ... and first preference was given to an in-house patient before anyone from the outside. It does surprise me to hear that a hefty entrance fee (or whatever it was called) was required before being accepted thru Medicaid. Otherwise, it sounds like the facility you found is very much a winner!!!! Please don't take this as a criticism, but is there a chance that your going to see her almost every day might be keeping her need or desire to meet a new friend to a minimum. Again, I think of my Mother, and in the 9-months she has been there, she has not made a close friend. I do think the dimentia kind of keeps that from happening. That is, the ""lack of trust"" in general was the first symptom I noticed a couple of years ago in my Mom. But I think encouragement in some way is necessary. A little over a month ago, I got a very rare call from Mom (with the help of a caregiver on staff). She seemed more distressed than normal. When I went over to see her, Mom wanted to talk to me in private and then said ""I feel so lonely here""!!! A few minutes later, one of my two favorite caregivers there walked past - and I called her over. In front of Mom, I mentioned to the caregiver that my Mother was really feeling lonely. It greatly surprised the caregiver ... and she told me that Helen has never said that to anyone here. There-in lies a likely common problem with a dimentia patient - especially one that was never really out-going in personality. She still trusted me enough to tell me - but did not (and may never) trust anyone there well enough to state her real needs. At least, one of the better caregivers there now knows of the uneasiness of my Mother - and, thank God, there are caregivers there that really do care ... makes me feel better!!! Well - maybe, just maybe - that 3-months may not be long enough yet for your Mother to feel comfortable enough to allow herself to be open to others there. But ... glad to hear there are some places offering Medicaid assistance with ""good"" caregivers - and with programs to keep the mind busy! P.S. - don't beat yourself up about any of this - you know you care - that is what matters.


 Oh yes the old ""take care of yourself thing"". Well.... there is only 24 hours in a day. Truthfully speaking after I give my mom a bath and wash her hair then blowdry and change her into her night gown for bed I am dead tired to do it all over again for myself. Especially since doing this whole ritual is against her will so I am fighting her to get into the tub and the same to get out. Yes I would love to take a long hot bath and read a nice fashion magazine then eat a peaceful dinner while having a lovely conversation with a few good friends. In order to do that someone would have to be home with my mom and that's not possible so if only one of us can get the royal treatment then I rather it's my mom. I have not gone out socially since 7 years ago. At least I have a job and a roof over my head so I can't really complain. I always think it's actually better to not get a break because I'll get too comfortable and have to come back to this again and I will then hate my mom. My 2nd brother maybe in denial about my mom but mostly it's because he doesn't want to deal with the illness. Not everyone is a saint like us. The oldest brother has health issues so he's in worse shape. I forgive him because I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. Whatever. I was born to be my mom's caretaker and here I am. Voila!


 Hi Miriam, No one wants to judge or should. At least you tried doing it yourself and it didn't work out. I just have a problem with people who instantly thinks a home is the solution. My sister is one of them and needless to say she is not in the care giving business with me. My mom is taking Namenda and I often wonder if it's doing any good. I'm afraid to have her go off of it in case she gets worse as a result. I just don't know. I read all kinds of reports on what's being done as a cure and no one seems to help existing patients because like it's too late. That's very discouraging to me. I often think dementia is the best disease to have. You don't feel anything and nothing matters to you anymore. It's the people who take care of you that suffers.


 Miriam, You have put yourself in her shoes. Your mom is in denial. She doesn't think she's like the others and maybe she's not as bad. She doesn't want to join in because maybe she likes one on one interaction where she can get special attention. My mom goes to a daycare center in the morning while I go to work. It pains me to see her go in and be seated with mentally retarded people and people with dementia that are worse off than her. I asked them to put her with the normals folks so she can have people to talk to but they said no because they want her seated in the ""special needs"" people where they can watch all of them at once. Selfish ******s! This is where my hatred for my sister comes in. She doesn't work and her kids are grown. She's very absorbed in her church work so that's more important to her than her own mother's well being. My mom would be better mentally if my sister would stay with her cause family is king in their mind. You are lucky that your mom still talks. My mom will say a word here and there and other times she nods off from boredom. Do you think you can hire someone to watch her in your home while you go to work? Govt pays for this stuff depending on your needs. You can just pay the caregiver extra $ to make up the difference or have her got to a daycare center like my mom goes. At least you will still have her at home and she can see you daily be comfortable in her own surrounding. It really would make a world of difference and give you a piece of mind. I cannot go a day without seeing my mom because I was always mommy's little girl. I guess that's to her benefit now.


 Seroquel gave my mom nightmares so yeah drugs do more harm then good. My mom is still on Namenda but not because I think it's doing any good but that I'm afraid of withdrawals if I take her off of it. My mom was good at bingo too when she she first went to the daycare center but slowly she lost the interest to play and started to put the chips in her mouth so they stopped it. Do what makes them happy. My sister wanted my mom in a home and she's on medicaid. I told her that those are horrible places and my sister refused to believe me and said she's only heard of nice things. Hopefully she will get to experience it herself when the time comes and see her eat her words. What might work is if Miriam's mom is asked to help out at the home so she would feel needed and that she's not the victim that needs to be pitied. Makes sense right? To have a purpose in life and feel wanted makes anyone feel good. Ask her to talk to the people worse off than her and to be like a big sister. I hope that's good advice.


 Wow your mom was loaded before. Yes I see what you mean but again I still think if you use reverse psychology and suggest to her that she should help the people worse off than her that she might feel differently. She doesn't want people to feel sorry for her but at the same time is there anyone you're seen that could befriend her? All it takes is just one person that she can pal around with. These 2 people that she talks a little with may not be that active themselves and they are already partnered up so maybe they don't want a 3rd person in their group. Yeah it's high school all over again. haha I would be severely depressed if I was in your shoes to have to see this. I'm in constant pain and I work full-time but as long as I'm still breathing I will hold on to my mom. I'm not saying everyone should be like me, it's just how I feel about my mom. I'm sure you have done all you can so be proud of what you have done so far. Sometimes I wonder what will happen to me when I'm older. I'm single and will not ever have anyone to take care of me. Well, who knows what the future holds. I'll just be content to know I took care of my mom and I rather suffer than to see her suffer.


 To Bella33 ...... Someone once told me more than once ""you have to take care of yourself first"" and if not ""who is going to take care of your Mother""! Actually more than one person has said that to me over the past two years. While I am divorced (for over 20-years), I have two daughters and two grandaughters. The grandaughters are protected from many things that are going on simply by not involving them in health issues. And my two daughters are functioning somewhat differently - much of it because they are 9-years apart. My oldest daughter, for the past year, has virtually turned her back on me - and of course, she's the one with my grandaughters. After sitting down with a Psycologist (who specializes in living with terminal diseases) last Summer, he felt I was correct in believing that my oldest was distancing herself from me because - she does not want to face me dying. It isn't uncommon ... and ""denial"" was one of the things her Mother was best at. My youngest daughter, has worked her butt off over the years. She is 27 and has a good job, a Masters degree and lives in a trendy rental neighborhood with her serious boyfriend (someone I would like to have for a son-in-law). After working two part-time jobs while going to college for 5-years and 2-degrees, she is living a bit ... and paying her student loans off before they are due! I really don't want to burden her with my health issues too much - just every once-in-awhile - when I need her to stay with me for a day - after routine surgery (that I need every 4-months) ... but I can't lay onto her any other stuff. What all of the above is about ... is a family doesn't make it easier sometimes. It should, you would think - but sometimes it even feels worse loving someone who turns their back on you. Sorry ..... about the hearts and flowers! It does do some good to vent though. Being able to vent ... and getting advise from others at times - are the two most valuable things about HW. I wish you strength ... and try to ignore the much less than ideal comments or lack of comments from family members. Don't let them get under your skin. You are the one who cares - even if they do not."
Worried my Mom is displaying early signs of Alzheimers.,"My 74 year old mother is displaying some behaviors that have me concerned. I will preface this by saying she lives 11 hours away from me, so I am not seeing her on a daily basis. Over the last couple of years I have noticed some problems with her memory. One example that really sticks out in my mind is the time she called me and said someone had stolen her medication. She called the police and filled out a report. Two days later she found her bottles in the liquor cabinet. Rather than admit she probably placed them there while getting her gin and tonic, she insisted the thieves had returned them to mess with her. Another thing that I am seeing is that she tells me the same stuff over an over within the same conversation. Next time I talk to her, it starts all over again. Same stories at least three times throughout the visit. The most disturbing to me is that her personality has changed over the last several months. She is negative, easily angered, seems to be irritable all of the time. That is not the mother I know. It has become so bad that I have had to ring off several times recently in order not to get angry with her. Tonight I tried to explain that her constant negativity is affected her relationship with me and her grandchildren. She hung up on me!! What can I do from so far away? Can I call her doctor and express my concern? Will they allow me to do that?","My closest sibling is 5 1/2 hours away from my mother. She thinks all her neighbors are drug dealers and she doesn't attend church. I have considered calling some of her friends but if she got wind that I was asking questions about her, I am afraid she would shut me completely out. As far as me taking her to the doctor, that will never happen. She doesn't see that there might be a problem. When I broached the subject that her recent behavior is detrimental to her family relationships she got angry and hung up on me. That is why I thought I might call her doctor and express my concerns. I realize he cannot speak about her medical treatments, maybe if he knew what is going on, he could watch for signs next time she is in his office.


 I'm so sorry to hear you are facing this challenge as your mom gets older! I am blessed that my sister lives very close to my mom and will be able to help when we get to this point. I found an online article that may provide some additional advice, in addition to what is offered here that I wanted to share with you - Caregiving From a Distance Praying for you! Post Edited (oscarsmom70) : 8/8/2013 12:24:48 PM (GMT-6)


 Do you have any siblings that live closer? What about neighbors, is she friends with them? A pastor at her church? If not, you might had to take a trip to her and take her to the dr to be evaluated. Because it sounds like she is indeed having some sort of dementia. It doesn't necessarily mean she has AD. It can be from from her medications to something physically wrong with her.


 To kali89027: So sorry to hear and especially with the distance from her - both from you or your siblings. The only thing is ... if you did call her doctor and mentioned these things to the doc ... what can the doc do about them. The stage of life you're describing can be a terrible thing for the adult child to deal with ... even when living close-by. Has anyone thought about getting or having a power of attorney for medical. That may not be the exact correct phrase ... but it allows someone the authority to make medical decisions for a person. It is such a delicate thing. It can be extremely threatening to the older person ... but it may be necessary. My Mother has been in an Assisted Living Home for Dementia for nearly a year now. And prior to that, she had a 24/7 care-giver living with her in her home for 15-months. Now, my Mother is 20-years older than yours ... so that would seem to make a huge difference. But it may not! Whatever you or your siblings might do, I'm sure the safety of your Mother is likely the most important in making a decision. And, of course, finances become important too. I don't know how you force your Mother into going to see the doctor. Is there a support group near you - for dementia or alzheimers? What I mean is a support group for the relatives or children of a person with dementia. That could be very helpful to you. I went to a local group here early last year several times ... and it gave me a better understanding of the disease, and of what I might expect, and of how to handle it. Good luck to you at a difficult time."
Vitamin B in multivitamin,I started my mom on crushed multivitamin containing B vitamins in the 200 - 400% DV level and I don't know if it's wishful thinking but she seems to be more alert and talking more the last few days. Has anyone else seen this happening to their loved ones? I read online about an Oxford study done a few years back that said it works for people with dementia but only after I already started her on this regimen. Am I on the right track?,"Bella33 - I think you're on the right track. I take Centrum Silver, Super B Complex, and B12 daily. I'm 75, and find it makes a big difference in how I'm feeling, compared to when I stop for a few days, as I occassionaly do, just because I get so tired of the hassle of having to crush them, and then how yuk they taste, even mixed with applesauce. When I was caring for my mom, I gave her a multivitamin, and noticed a difference in her fairly quickly. My problem with that was it brought out the side of her that would have made my staying with her impossible, so I discontinued them and just kept her active, physically and mentally, which made her happy again, and also kept her in a lot better shape overall than she'd been in when I'd gotten there. An added B12 daily might also help your mother. Its deficency symptoms include appitite loss, diminished reflex response, memory impairment, mental depression and confusion. You might try it for a short time to see if it helps more. I've never seen any warnings of B12 being dangerous, but you could check that out first.


 Thank you.


 Thanks for you input. I give Nature Made Multi for her 50+ vitamins along with their calcium 500mg The multi contains 417% DV for B12. It's given to her after she returns from the daycare center which is when she takes her nap. I noticed she doesn't sleep as long and is slightly more awake in the afternoon because of it. I'm hoping it will keep stimulating her mind and clear up the gunk that's causing the dementia. She never complains about the taste of this in her apple sauce. Her PD medication tastes worse. B12 is water soluable so it leaves the body pretty quickly. My mom has always been very gentle so she has never acted up before. She just stays quiet and then falls asleep all day long. I know it's due to inactivity but not much i can do about it since she gets tired very easily and won't watch TV because her attention span is non existent. When she sits for more than 5 minutes then she closes her eyes. Her PD medication and possibly the Namenda she takes may be causing this. There is not much I can do about that. Not take them and suffer more consequences. I have been a vitamin person for years. I suppose it's working or else I should be in a coma from working full time job and taking care of my mom. I cannot take B-complex types of vitamins cause it makes me hyper. But then I have an anxiety disorder so I'm charged up as it is."
(No Subject),"Hi everybody. I have just joined. I've been a member to Alzconnected.org and really enjoyed it there, but, today I was surfing the net and came across this forum. I am a full time caregiver to my 72 year old mother in my home who was diagnosed in 2009. She is later stage 6, early seven. I just wanted to say hi, before I start learning how to navigate this forum. Shelley","Hello Shellasim ... and welcome: I too have a Mother in a Home for Dementia, and it's been an experience. Early last year, the local Senior Center had a weekly get together for caregivers (mostly of parents) that was my first exposure to some degree of caregiving. It had a facilitator that was barely 25 years old and a graduate of the local State University ... but she had an amazing degree of perception. Unfortunately, the program stopped for some unknown reason. During that timeframe, my Mother was at home with a 24/7 live-in care-giver who was good, and I learned a little from her. Then last September, Mom's doctor said he wanted her to be in a facility that had a registered nurse - so a new chapter began. My Mother is 95 years old, is incontinent and is mostly confined to a wheelchair. But .... until she was 93, she was happily and independantly living alone, driving and I called her daily just to checck in. It has been an experience - only wish I had some family who could have helped - but Mom has adjusted to the Home for Dementia pretty well, and with every visit, I have developed a greater appreceation for the care she has been getting.


 Hi Shelley and welcome to the forum. My Mother has dementia, and lives in a memory care facility. It's awesome that you are taking care of your Mom full time. Unfortunately, since I'm the breadwinner in the family, I havent had that opportunity but she is in good hands and closer to my other siblings (we moved her after my Dad passed.) My sisters and brother visit her everyday, so they have quite a presence the the home. Again, welcome!"
A quick update on,"Hi All, Well I have the unhappy news that ""Dad"" was placed into Hospice today. Of course we have our chins up, but it doesn't look like he's going to make it too much longer. We likely only have months with him now. The good news is that means that we will finally be getting some respite care!! The 'ball' has been dropped several times now with things like getting respite care, getting training on how to lift ""Dad"" from the bed (we've hurt us and ""Dad"" now thanks to this! ), and a few other things. We are hoping Hospice has it together enough to not drop the ball....or they won't like the person I will become at this stage in ""Dad's"" life. No one gets to do that any more, and I'm just stubborn enough to be likely the loudest squeaky wheel they've ever heard! So hubby and I are looking forward to having a few days to sleep more than 2 hours at a time and being able to stay in bed for more than the 6 hours of broken sleep we've been getting! It'll also be interesting to sit down during an entire meal!!!!","It's been kind of crazy. Everyone -including the Hospice nurse that was here yesterday has been surprised at how quickly he seemed to decline. Although he did hit his head pretty hard just before the first of the year and then again just three weeks ago. I did some reading (of course), and read that hits to the head can bring on more severe symptoms and decline with Alzheimer's/dementia patients. So I think that had a lot to do with this sudden decline. The biggest decline has been over the last three weeks since the last hit to the head. He had gone into his room as he was agitated that dinner wasn't ready as soon as he said he was hungry (LOL!) and we believe he sat down in his chair, but when he tried to get up, he lost his balance and fell - hitting his head against the wall pretty hard. We rushed him in to the Emergency room of course and he ended up with 9 staples in the top of his head! Scared the day lights out of all of us! It took a few days for the sudden decline to start, but by around day 4 after the last hit to the head, we could see that he was losing even more cognitive function, and fast. The other thing is that we don't really know how bad things were before he moved in with us as he lived alone. All we knew was that he was always ""very busy"" and was never ready when we got there to take him anywhere - not that that was an issue, we just waited for him to get ready or changed our plans. BUT - no one knew for sure how well he got along on his own. The nurse said it was possible that once he moved in with us, he felt safe and cared for and had a 'rally' that he otherwise wouldn't have had. I kind of cornered the Hospice nurse and asked about what time period she's seen the most when a patient is at this point and she said he's likely only got a few months left. He now can't even get out of bed, he can't stand on his own and can hardly sit up for long without sliding out of the chair. He's beginning to have trouble swallowing liquids and his pills. He goes days without wanting any food and just wants to sleep much of the time. After reading the Hospice notebook we got, it all fits into the ""timeline"" that it talks about as a person nears the end of their life. My heart breaks for my husband now as he goes through loosing his Dad.


 Thank you Carol. I really appreciate your kind words. I only hope that Hospice provides much more help than any one else here has. This man deserves some decent care. My husband and I are doing everything we can to provide for him, but it's worse than pulling toe nails trying to get help here in this area. It sure tells me what I'll be doing when we get through our own ordeal - volunteering my time on forums and on the phone to help others going through this. Had we know half of what we know now, we would have been able to get much more help not only for ""Dad"", but for us as well. Again, thank you for your kind words, and sorry for the short rant.


 Thank you so much for the encouragement, Carol. Things like that can and do mean the world to me - I'm sure you can relate, having gone through this yourself.


 Awww I'm so so sorry to hear this! I didn't think he was that bad off to be in hospice?? What's been happening?


 Traveler, I'm so sorry to hear about your beloved father in law. I can tell you that we had Hospice in for my Mom, my Dad, and my mother in law -- and they were the most amazing folks ever. Every little thing was taken care of and if it wasn't, all you have to do is call and they will be there for you. Now is the time to let them help you as much as possible so that you have time to spend with that precious man. Take care, and thinking of you. Carol


 I remember the days I was in the same predicament -- it's so tough Traveler. Some days I wanted to scream, ""Why can't I get any help?"" I can remember when Hospice took over and I was so amazed at everything that was taken care of without me having to do a thing...which was unusual. The nurses are superb and provide great relief -- they are experts in dealing with this stage in life. I said the same thing; I'll try and guide whomever I can through this process. I'm 54, and so many people around me are dealing with the same elderly parental issues, and it's good to have somewhat of a support group. One thing we all agree on is that our age group really is the first to have to deal with the aging parent issues on such a large scale, so it's fairly new territory for most of us. You and your husband are doing a fantastic job. I still question if I should have done things differently sometimes, but you do the best you can at the time. Take care, and be proud and happy that you are providing the best care possible for your father in law. Hugs, Carol"
Mother in law with dementia and Alzheimer's,"Have you talked to your husband to discuss how the calls are putting a strain on your marriage? How does your husband feel about her calls? Is she wandering? How is she taking care of herself after the home care leaves? Is she able to care for herself? If she is a danger to herself, than she needs to be in an AL center pronto. In the meantime, you should have a little more patience. She doesn't know what she is doing. You have to realize that when an adult develops AD or dementia, they practically revert back to being a child. Would you get angry at a child for repeating questions over and over? It can be very frustrating and I can totally understand where you are coming from. But it's also scary for the person who has AD/dementia and sometimes reaching out is a small comfort they can give themselves. If the calls are coming at all hours of the night or if she calls when you are having alone time with your husband, such as dinner or watching a movie. Turn off the phone and let it go to an answering machine/voice mail. When you or your husband are free, call her back; just to make sure everything is okay.","Oh my! It does sound like your husband is in denial. His mother should not be driving at this stage and yes, eventually she may just kill herself or others (for example, confuse the gas and brake pedal). Does he have any siblings? Does she have any other living relatives?


 I know how rough this can be. My father passed away in October, and he kept pretty good check on my Mother who has dementia. After Dad passed, we moved her closer to my sisters and brother, and she lives in a memory care facility -- where she needs to be! They put in a phone for her, but they get calls all day and during the night time hours saying she doesn't know where she is and could someone please come and take her home because she is in the mountains. One week she left several messages for me on my home phone. She doesn't remember anything from one second to the next. Tell your husband that he needs to take care of his Mom; he is not doing her any favors by letting her drive. What you can do? Either call her doctor or put in an anonymous letter to the DMV to have her license taken away. She is NOT SAFE!!! I know you realize that, but maybe print these posts out and show them to your husband. The other thing you can do is have someone intervene and talk to your husband such as a social worker from one of the health care agencies or the state. Good luck, and please come back -- don't feel you are alone out there!


 henritink, Good Afternoon. You have been shouldering a lot. Congratulations on finding this site and beginning the process of seeking assistance. Your MIL has twice been lost in public so there should be 2 police reports re those incidence. She has home health already involved with her on a daily basis. Where is the social worker to do a safety assessment to decide if she is safe living alone ? I would first look into helping your husband realize he needs to call in Social Services to make a plan of care for your MIL which I am sure from what you have written will identify that your MIL needs to be in a Memory Care Center. It may help to focus on the problem here and with gentle support your husband will understand better. This is about his Mother's safety which is at risk here. It is truly not about him or about you so if you can come together as a team I think the two of you can make life better. Check your state's Web site under aging services. There should be contact information there and maybe someone can direct you to local services that can help. Sometimes we need to be kind but firm when our spouses cannot deal with the reality of a dangerous situation. Let your husband know you support him but he must take responsibility for his Mother and get her to a safe place to live. As hard as it is to do, try to keep your own emotions out of this conversation and remember you had a good marriage going until his Mom became ill. You can have that back. Please know you are not alone in this situation. <span class=text438Font1>Alzheimer's Disease impacts the lives of millions of Americans and their families. Scientists and researchers continue to search for new answers to help solve this devastating disease that touches the lives of so many individuals.[/color] Do know we support you and don't give up on your husband - help educate him in the need to provide the best and safest care possible for him Mom.


 i am glad i found this website and that im not alone! i have just been so down in the dumps with no one to talk to about it because i dont know anyone in my situation. i love my husband dearly its just been a rough road with his mother. at times i feel i contribute to his stress because i nag at him when she calls all the time. i tell him if she was in a facility she wouldnt be calling saying shes all by her lonesome and scared. its almost as if my husband has another wife he has to deal with she puts all of her problems on him then i feel if i have a problem i cant go to him because hes too busy with her.


 you are receiving some very good advice and it is good that you came to this site so that you have some support. I can see how frustrating this is for you, but I hope you can see the other side of this...not only is your mother in law frightened, but your husband is as well. It's very difficult for grown children to suddenly become the parents of our parents. It's just not natural and so very scary to realize what is happening to our parent. It definitely sounds like your MIL is very afraid to be alone. She will be so much better off in an assisted living facility or special memory section. The Alzheimer's Association has a hot line, I don't have the number, but someone is available 24/7. You can get the phone number off of their website www.alz.org. I truly hope your husband does something soon. Miriam


 You can provide a cell phone that can be locked up for real emergencies


 It's a miracle something horrific hasn't happened to your MIL and it sounds like it is just a matter of time. I realize this isn't your decision to be made and how frustrated you must be, to be thinking of leaving. Is there any way you can get your husband to talk to someone else who can make him understand how serious this situation is? I truly hope so. By the way, my mother was diagnosed with AZ, MODERATE stage, almost 9 years ago and she remains in MODERATE stage, so to say it's just a few more years is incorrect. She has been taking two medications for dementia and they are keeping her stable. This could potentially go on for many more years. Miriam


 I'm sad to say that Kitt has a very good point about possible neglect. I know that this whole situation is very frustrating for you and understandably so. If the neighbors are calling APS than it may be out of your husbands hands eventually. But please do not give up on your husband. He is in denial and that can take a while to overcome; please have patience. There has to be a reason you married him in the first place yes? In the meantime, keep working on him to make him see that his mother needs 24 hour care.


 *grabs Skittty and huggles* Howa reyou??? I agree with Sherry and Skitt alother every time I spy a Kitt, I always think of one of my felines who's currently next to me meowing and trying to convince me he needs treats. That is, after I just gave him 4. His name is SKittles, short Skit and Skidz


 Yes they do Kitt. I used to take my Jack Russel/Terrier to see my Gma on occasion at the AL center. Sometimes my Black Lab as well. All the residents loved seeing my dogs.


 My Mom's care home has a cat that roams the halls and visits the residents. It is great therapy, and the residents love the cat! Henritink, I certainly hope that someone steps in to help your mother in law. I know how difficult it is; and I'll probably take some heat on this -- but for some reason many men tend to stick their heads in the sand when it comes to tending to their elderly parents. I can only say this based on several experiences. Even my Dad used to say thank heavens he has three daughters! As for the wandering at night; my mother does that almost every night which is exactly the reason we chose a locked facility that had a sufficient night staff for Sundowner's folks. Good luck, thinking about you!


 my mother in law has dementia/alzheimer's. i am losing my mind because she is driving me crazy! my husband and i have only been married for 2 1/2 years and his mom calls at least 20 times a day sometimes more. she lives alone since her husband passed a little over a year ago. the phone calls drive me insane and are putting a big strain on my marriage. she doesn't want anything when she call its always confused conversation like how did i get here? when am i leaving? who is coming to get me? she has lived in her house for 20 years and nobody is coming to get her. she needs to be in a facility like assisted living. we have home health care come there everyday from 10am-6pm but once they leave the phone calls begin! i cant take it much more and i am considering leaving my husband because it seems our marriage is all about his mom anymore and im so depressed and angry and i deserve to be happy. am i just being selfish and crazy myself? i don't know what to do can anyone please give me some advise or words of wisdom? is anyone else going through anything like this or similar?


 thank you for your reply. she doesn't wander once the home care leaves. i have tried to talk to my husband about the phone calls but he always says what can i do? she doesnt have anyone else to call. i mean if it was just a couple phone calls then it wouldnt even be an issue but its a ridiculous amount of phone calls as long as she is awake. the other night she called the cops because she was scared. this isnt ok to me this is a big red flag she should be in assisted living. my husband is in such denial. she still has the keys to her car because he is too scared to take them from her a few months ago she went to target looking for her lung doctor and they had to call the police and my husband came to her rescue because the cop was gonna pink slip her but my husband took her home and assured them it will never happen again. i guess she has to kill herself or someone else before he realizes she needs 24 hr care. i do have have a hard time with patience. i guess 2 1/2 years into my marriage i just wasnt expecting this to happen. so it makes me sorta bitter because this wasnt what i dreamed about . i know things happen but why cant he see she needs more care than just 8 hrs a day.


 he has a brother that took off to florida a few years ago and does not want to be bothered. they come from a small family so at this point its only she only has my husband. i dont see my husband putting her in assisted living anytime soon so im going to stick it out a few more weeks then i think im going to look for my own place. i have been dealing with this for over a year now and im only 32 years old with a 13 year old daughter who deserves to have a mom who is happy and not sad and angry all the time. im crying right now because i have been with my husband for nine years total and i hate for it to end this way but i just dont think there is any other way. my mother in law is 75 she could live another 10-20 years im not going to give up that much of my life being sad and angry.


 I don't have experience with this kind of situation but here are my thoughts anyway: First, I think she needs round the clock care for her safety as well as for others. Maybe a visit to her doctor will be necessary for a request for this. Is she covered by Medicare or Medicaid, some sort of insurance? You will need to check with what services are available to her in your area. Ask your doctor's office for references in your town/city for where your husband should call. You must have a sit-down talk with your husband. He needs a wake-up call to this situation. I understand a reluctance for putting a parent in a facility but he needs to understand that his mother is scared and perhaps not in control of what she says or does and that she might be a danger to herself. Find a family counselor through insurance, city services or your church and have some sessions with your husband attending. All of this if for the sake of your marriage and for the well-being of everyone, not only his mother but of your own child.


 Yes, it is rough on a marriage. My husband's mother just passed from dementia and heart issues, so we had my father, mother, and his mother. He supported me through the tough times in dealing with my parents, and I supported him when he was back in Philly for over three weeks. Trust me, as you'll see in another post from me, I was feeling the same way; I just wanted my life back. So I totally understand how you are feeling -- I haven't had a vacation in years and we are just starting to return to a normal life. It's tough to take care of elderly parents especially when they have dementia, and you are trying to work and hold your own life together. I agree with Kitt, please get a social worker or someone to do an assessment.


 I thought having my Mom in a facility would be the key too; and she definitely is much better off where she is -- that is a fact. But because she has a phone in her room, and is confused all the time, she doesn't realize what time it is, if she just called my sisters/brother, or what's going on. That is the reason for her numerous calls at all hours to them. I keep thinking they just need to take the phone out, but they think it's her lifeline...but she has staff members right outside of her door for any help she needs. So I hear you. Your husband is probably scared too. The person that raised him is no longer the responsible person she once was, and it's tough. Now he has to be the caretaker. Call a local agency or take the info off the web about caretaking and the responsibilities. Go to lunch at a couple of the memory care facilities -- knowledge is power. And also, his Mom is lonesome and scared. Sometimes I try to put myself into my Mom's shoes and wonder what it feels like to start losing your memory and not knowing where you are. The whole thing is so difficult! Just keep talking -- it's good for me as well!


 Here's an idea....... There are telephones that are for alheimers and dementa patients.... its where the phone recieves incoming calls only, and there is no outgoing calls. www.alzstore.com its called a ""dial-less phone"" you can do those teddy bear cameras and have it linked to your computer. Considering you have home care already for her, I'm sure you can get round the clock home care. And some adjsutments around the house liek the dial less phone, you and yoru hubby can agree he will call her say every 3 to 4 hours and the convo can last up to 30 minutes. That way, shes not calling you as much, she can't call the cops. CHildproof doors, stove, fridge, microwave, etc. And I hate to say this, but she's either in the middle or last stage of AZ.. which means, she will pass on within the next few years. Why deprive your husband of what little time he is going to have left? And I would really think about this... do you really love your husband? You are considering leaving him over a mother in law that has a medical condition to where she doesnt have a right frame of mind. Do you what AZ and dementia does? It litterly takes your brain and reverses it in time to where a person is a baby again. They stop walking, talking, lucky to eat, so on. It will get to the point where she will have no clue what so ever who your husband is or you. Yes it is straining on any relationship, but no my significant other never at least once considering leaving me because he understood what what happening and realized it was only a time left. No, your mother in law will not live another 10 to 20 years. It seems she is in the middle or last stage of AZ. If its the last stage, you'd be lucky to have 3 years. I'm sorry if I seem harsh, but I want to you look at it from what is actually happening. It seems you dont understand AZ fully. Yes she needs help, but so do you if you are actually considering leaving your husband over a family member. I did 24/7 care, only time I got off was 3 hours a week until I was able to get respite for 3 times a month. Now that is straining. How would you feel if you were your mother in law? How would you like it knowing somethings wrong with you but you have no clue. How would you like the hallucinations? My GMA's hallucinations was our house being a children's meat factory where I'd murder kids and have their heads laying around the house while I grind their bodies for meat. Sorry Sherry but that was her hallucations (now you know why I'd be crying so much here) Examine yourself and get the help you, mother in law and husband needs. Someone has to be the strong head. Sorry Sherry you knew this was gonna come out


 well someone called adult protective services about my mother in law wandering at night. my husband doesnt believe she does this and that the neighbors are making it up so he is not going to put her in an assisted living yet he is still going to keep her at her house with home health care only coming 10am-6pm m-f the 11-3 on sat and sun. i know all about alzheimers i am a nurse. its just that i have never had to deal with it outside of work. and the reason i think of leaving my husband is because his mom needs more care than just 8 hrs a day and he is in denial about it. so i just take things one day at a time and hope he makes the right decision soon


 If your MIL is classified as a vulnerable adult and your husband is responsible for her then by not addressing her personal safety he may fall into the category of committing abuse by neglect. Neglect is defined as the refusal or failure to fulfill any part of a person's obligations or duties to an elder. Her safety is not only important between the hours of 10am-6pm but all the hours in a day. Federal and most state laws require that licensed healthcare professionals report suspected elder abuse, usually to an adult protective services (APS) agency. I am wondering what adult protective services has had to say re your MIL if they have already been notified by another person. Kindly, Kitt


 Great point Sherry. It is extremely difficult for adult children to make a decision to put a parent in a home as it is the end of an era for both the parent and the child. Your husband's Mother will no longer be living in her own home where she has been happy as well as your husband wants so badly to not be the ""one"" to take away her home that he is truly lost and needs support in making the right decision. Don't give up on any of you. Kindly, Kitt


 Awwww Smurfy, I am good and thanks for the ""huggles"". My ""stkitt"" user name stands for St. Kitt - one of the most beautiful places I have ever had the good fortunate to travel to. However I do have one big ole snuggly adorable cat named Marty Cat. My granddaughter who is 8 has a kitty named ""Lollipop-drop-tootsiepop-snowshoe"". She calls her kitty Tootsie for short. Sorry folks a bit OT. However another good selling point for Memory Care Settings is they often have pet therapy available. From what I have heard many of the residents love to see the pets. Huggles, Kitt


 omg how did you do that skittt?? all I do is click ""pose reply"" and wirte and it wont leet me change bold or colo


 Oh god can I relate!! maybe my story will make u feel like ur situation isn't so bad (not that I am trying to dismiss ur valid issue). I LIVE with my mother-in-law!!! At least u don't have to answer the phone which I stopped doin poor to moving in with fiance. Be thankful u don't live with.her b/c that will definitely break up ur marriage. My MIL calls me names, wakes me up constantly to beaten and accuse me of losing her things, starts an argument with me the second I come home from work, starts beating me with questions the moment I wake up in the morning. And those are on her ""good"" days. Honestly, it seems like she purposely messes with me. On top of that she now refuses to where her hearing aids so I have to yell to tell her anything. That is fun in the morning. So, I would gladly switch places with you. Try not to answer all calls. She will eventually not call as much."
My experience with Alzheimer's,"My mother had Alzheimer's, and died at 91. Two of my sisters, aged 75 and 79, also had it and died in 2011. Another sister died at 58 from Amyloidosis. I also have a Down Syndrome nephew. I took an emergency retirement when I was 55, to take care of my mother so she wouldn't have to go into the nursing home, which had been her greatest fear. I mention the Amyloidosis, and the Down Syndrome, because I'd read a report online at the time my sister died and we'd realized Mom had Alzheimer's, that said a link between the Alzheimer's, Amyloidosis and Down Syndrome was being considered. I have no idea what ever came of that study. I spent a little over four years with my mother, 24/7, with virtually no help at all. She broke her hip at the end of the fourth year, and I knew she'd have to remain in the nursing home, but I spent a lot of time each day with her during the first year of her stay there. In the years I spent with her, seeing the person I called ""Mom"" disappear in increments until all that was left was the shell that looked like my mother, was the most precious time in my life, and if I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a heartbeat. What I got from the experience can't be described, but it transformed me. At the beginning of our time together, I didn't have a clue what lay before us. I tried to find books in the Library on the disease, in order to have some understanding of what I faced. There were only technical books on the medical side. I'd gone to meeting that were held in my hometown, but they only managed to scare me because they were mostly about the legal aspects. So I gritted my teeth, and stiffened my spine, and got ready to face whatever came, and to deal with it then. I decided to keep a daily journal with the idea that I might be able to provide useful information for people who would find themselves in my position, and needed insight into what was to come. I managed to get the journal typed a couple of years after I'd done all I could for Mom, and knew I had to find someplace where I could take care of myself, and heal. I had several years of major flashbacks, and a lot of anger to deal with, none of the anger related to Mom. I planned to retype the journal, removing the very personal, family-type things from it, but I had numerous things happen that has kept me from it, and now my vision does. There's without a doubt a lot more information out there now than there was in 1992, so I don't worry about it much any more.","Sorry about your dad Sarah Louise. I've been called several things for having given up everything I had to take care of my mother, but amazing wasn't one of them. I thank you for that, but I'm not amazing. Different, yes. Very thankful I was able to find the mother I could have had, if she'd been given half a chance in her life. And sad that my siblings never knew her as I came to, and didn't really want to.

 Welcome to HealingWell I am so sorry for your loss, I too, know the hardships of losing someone so close to our heart. Your idea of giving tips is wonderful. Even me, an old dog, can learn new tricks :) (no offense people) I consider this site as my family, well online family :) We go through thick and thin, and I dont personally have many in my family I can turn too. You hang in there :)


 It is amazing at what they say sometimes. I had the same problem, I put door alarms on all doors except my room and bathroom. I also put ohh Red what is that name? The baby proof door knob thingy on the door knob (Someone will come up with the word I'm looking for I think)


 I am sorry to hear about your mother and the way you saw her decline but it sounded like you took good care of her. As a medical student I am interested to know what your experiences, as carers or patients have been of healthcare professionals in dealing with the diagnosis of dementia. Have your consultations with consultants and GP's been good or bad and why? ie- did they listen to your concerns and put you in touch with community support programmes? What would you like to change about the way dementia is approached by society and healthcare professionals? I want to try and correlate your feelings so that my colleagues and myself are able to improve the care that we can give sufferers and their carers. I would really welcome your feedback. Thank you.


 Watching the people we love suffer from AD can be very hard. Your mother was lucky to have you, not all AD sufferers have that support and love. I'm sorry about your losses. There is a lot of literature out there about AD but I think the one that can really strike home is a book called ""Still Alice"". This is a book that is written from the view of the actual AD patient, I believe the later chapters were written by her daughter. It's been a few years since I've read it but it still sticks in my mind. I highly recommend it.


 Thank you Sherry. I came to realize while caring for my mother, that AD is the most terrible disease there is. Not only for what it does to those suffering from it, but for what the family goes through. Someone else recently mentioned ""Still Alice"" to me. I'm really pleased to know about it. Just as I'm pleased to know there's so many forums for people looking for answers. I'd put AD behind me in 2001, after Mom died, because six months later, I seemed to have gotten everything in the book. I told my doctor recently that I feel like the cosmic's petri dish, because I have so many ""I don't know what it is"" conditions, along with the diagnosed ones. I need to keep my mind occupied though, and politics has gotten too far from reality anymore to be interesting, and I thought a forum such as this one might be a place for me to share some of what I learned while caring for my mother.


 When I was caring for my mother, there was an article in the AD Newsletter about placing a dark rug in front of the door to keep those suffering with the disease from getting out. I put one in front of our door. Mom stepped on it without even noticing, and was out the door. To try to keep her from wandering in the night, I sprinkled some cat litter on the floor outside her bedroom door. The next morning she came out and told me, ""Boy, I hard time going anywhere because of all the big rocks in the road.""


 My mom laughed a lot. She had a beautiful laugh. She was able to see the humor in so much of what she was doing, and our laughing together about such things made the horror of it all somehow more bearable for me. Our biggest laugh came one morning when she came out of her bedroom all dressed, but she obviously hadn't managed her sweater too well. Then I realized she'd put her legs in the sleeves, and not knowing what to do with the corners of the sweater she had in each hand, she was trying to pull them over her shoulders so hard the sleeves were barely showing below her dress. It had taken me awhile to figure out why she always ended up with both stockings on her right foot. She had arthritis pretty bad in her left knee and it hurt lifting that foot high enough to put the sock on it.


 Hi Harriet. I'm not sure exactly what you're asking for, but I'll offer what I can. I've never looked back on those years with Mom with regret for anything, except the few times (and it was only a few) that I couldn't handle a situation, and was short with her. But I realized it wasn't her, it was an imbalance in me, and I quickly got it under control. We had fairly quickly switched roles, with her becoming the child, and I the mother. And as I would have fought to the death for my real children, I felt the same with her. I was told by someone that I should go to this something Resources, and sign up for respite care, and I did. But when they told me my income, as well as Mom's would be used to pay for that respite care, I left. In my last year with her, a worker from this place came by to talk to me, and I told him about that, and he said that was wrong. So for the last eight months I had her with me, I had four hours a month when I could get out and think about just me. I don't know if this has changed yet, but I was also told that if I was taking care of a stranger, I could be getting $1,000 a month, but since it was a relative, I wouldn't get anything. Our doctor was quick to tell me what a great thing I was doing, but that I really needed to take care of me too. Yet at the end, when the hospital bed I'd gotten after Mom got up and ended up sitting on the cold floor for I don't know how long before I woke up at seven and found her, was going to be taken away unless the doctor wrote another prescript ion for it, the doctor's response was that maybe I should put a mattress on the floor for Mom. She couldn't get up off the floor, even with help. And in our last six months together, when I didn't dare leave Mom alone for a minute unless she was asleep or eating, I'd mentioned something to the doctor about the growing cost of caring for Mom, and the doctor's response was that if we needed money, maybe I should get a job. The ladies that came to sit with Mom on those four hours of respite were great. She was always laughing when I got home, and would talk about them and how nice they were for quite awhile after they left. In the nursing home, I saw the way those caring for the patients viewed them. There were the special ones I called Angels because they were so caring and careful always. But for the rest, I felt like they needed a reminder that one day they would find themselves at that same place on the road of life, and should consider how they'd feel if they were being treated as they were treating these elderly people who could no longer take care of themselves. So I put together a collage of Mom's life, with a big picture of her at around the age most of them were, and surrounded it with smaller pictures of her at all ages. And I hung it over her bed. Beside it I put a brief summary of her life, which was pretty impressive. And I also put the poem I'd written as a reminder to myself when I'd begun the journey with Mom, of what she was going through, and how she'd want to be treated. It all made quite an impact on the whole staff. Everyone there must have gone in to check it all out. I'd like to see a change in how so many people still view dementia even now as ""crazy."" I know people are becoming more aware because A.D. looms as a possibility in more and more people's lives every day. There are the good commercials on television, such as the one of mother and daughter getting ready to go somewhere, and the mother appears like any other elderly mother, only somewhat confused. This commercial shows that people with dementia still look and act like grandma or grandpa. Then there's the bad, like the bleach commercial that makes me want to scream, where the grandmother is dancing two raw chickens around on the coffee table while the grandchildren sit on the couch laughing, and the daughter walks through the door, and say's in a resigned voice, ""Hello, Mother."" And then the bleach is shown. I did write to the company about this and another commercial they've been airing that are so offensive, and one seems to have been pulled, but unfortunately this one is still on. Hope all this helps a little."
Diet,"My 98-year-old father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 8 years ago. For the past four years I've been his 24/7 caregiver, and I've discovered that his frequent, frightening lapses into delusion/anxiety/aggression can be controlled with diet. First of all, lots of water and juices (low-sugar apple, cranberry, and cherry). Also lots of fresh vegetables, alone or in soups: tomatoes, broccoli, cabbage, kale, collards, okra, eggplant, celery, mustard greens, turnip greens. Fresh fruit at every meal (bananas, apples, strawberries, blueberries, pears). Tons of plain yogurt. Olive oil. For protein: eggs, skim milk, chicken, fish -- but in small amounts throughout the day rather than a big meaty dinner at night. No cheese. No peanut butter. No red meat. No cookies, cake, candy. Bread and pasta only occasionally. As it turns out, I now realize this is a low-fat, sugar-free, gluten-free diet. But the reason it works for Dad (I believe) is that it prevents constipation, UTI, and dehydration, all of which are known as common causes of mental confusion in the elderly. Three medicines also help: Flomax, Senna, and Cerefolin. The success of this diet tends to bolster my theory that Alzheimers is not the right diagnosis for him. Since the beginning of the full, perfected diet 6 months ago, he has had consistently clear thinking without confusion (although his memory is still terrible).","I don't think it matters too much what the diagnosis is, since he's doing so well. In fact, I don't know of any other 98-year-olds who are as healthy and happy as he is now.


 Unfortunately many doctors don't really know much about the ""superannuated"" (people who're over 90). Most drugs haven't been tested on the very old, and neither have most diets.


 Wow, I certainly would seek a second medical opinion. And welcome to Healing Well! I have to agree, I honestly don't know what it is. It doesn't sound fitting, but hey you never know. I'm not a doctor.


 If you have not seen this video yet you need to. This doctor cured herself from stage 2 MS. She also implicates how we feed our bodies to other diseases like Alzheimer's. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLjgBLwH3Wc"
Patient think they watched something before,My mom has dementia. When we watch television with her she is always saying she has seen the show we are watching before. This is generally impossible because it is a first run show the first night it airs. If we explain this she gets very agitated. Does anyone else think they remember things that are impossible to be remembered?,"Thanks. I meant to say did any of their loved ones do this


 I have recently noticed that my gmother remembers past events with imaginary parts that totally never happened. This is new. She was diagnosed in 2010 as early stages; reevaluated yesterday as slow decline. We are now having to get her to understand that things need to change so she can be safe and continue her life living independently, just not alone. Paranoia is present. Delerium nearly. Since the Dr. appmnt. It appears that the extreme stress of accepting this is causing a severity of the symptoms. This is still new to use because after one Dr. said it was, another said it wasnt. Now the MRI says it is. Sorry to have run off topic. yeah it seems to me that her imagination trys to improvise for the loss of memory. I will definitely focus on ""going with the flow"" when possible.


 Most of the people posting on here are caregivers, but that is pretty typical for someone with dementia. I found that if you don't try to correct someone with memory issues, that it makes them more content - go with the flow kind of thing.


 My Gma not so much but she did talk to the tv :)"
Night Time Wandering and Psychosis Sleep Medication?,"My Dad currently takes Exelon patch, Seroquel and Carbidopa/Levodopa for his Alzheimer's Disease. He has cycles in which he barely sleeps during the night, and is instead up wandering the house, tearing his bedclothes apart, going through drawers, opening the front door (even though he has problems doing that during the day), and yelling for my Mom to come look at something that isn't there. (He and my Mom live next door to my husband and me.) His doctor upped his Seroquel to two pills at night, but that seemed to make things worse, so we dropped it back to one pill. Does anyone else have this problem with their AD patient? If so, does that person take some type of sleeping medication to help out? I'm not sure if the doctor figures that the extra Seroquel would make my Dad drowsier, or if he just doesn't want to prescribe another medication. Thanks. Anna","Yes, it's called Sundowner's and most AD patients have this. It's really tough but I'd speak with the physician again and let them know what is going on -- maybe you could have an aide come in during the night to help out so your Mom and all of you can get some sleep?


 Yes, my Dad was the same way with my Mom and would even ""hide"" things just so we wouldn't know what was happening with her. Of course we noticed! Neither of them wanted someone around all the time, but when my Dad became too feeble to take care of both of them and the household duties, we needed to step in and make the decision. Sometimes you have to watch out for the caretaker as well -- even though they state things are okay with them. This age group is a stubborn bunch, but that's how they made it through so many situations throughout their lives. Your parents are so fortunate to have you next door...I was about 10 minutes away, but it was tough to have to hold down a full time job, family, and take care of all their medical appointments, housekeeping, etc. So it just made sense for us to get some help. My siblings are all 3 hours away and they would help when they could, but it's just a tough situation. Take care, and keep sharing! And, so glad you are going to support groups. That's a great thing!


 I'm sorry to hear that your dad has AD, but unfortunately this the nature of the beast. The night time ""antics"". I ran into that when my Gma lived with me. My son, who lives with us, would take over the night time duties for me. He has told me that Gma would do some crazy things in the night...looking for food for her (imaginary) ""friends"" to opening the door etc. When she fell and broke her arm I tried giving her a sleep aid because she did NOT sleep at all....you would've thought I gave her a kid aspirin because it did not work at all! But the opening doors at night is disconcerting....have you installed alarms on the doors? Or put some sort of safety feature on them?


 Thanks for the responses! Regarding opening the front door at night, we're looking at getting several ""simple"" latches to add to the inside of the door. Dad seems to be able to turn the knobs to open the door at night, but when it comes to the latch of the outer storm door he has problems. Regarding having an aide come in during certain hours...my Mom, age 83, is of the 'old school' of people who grew up taking care of themselves, etc. and doesn't want a stranger coming into the house. I'm right next door if they need me and have gone over at night on several occasions. Its interesting...my Mom and I attend a support group one day a month with a group of other caregivers. There are anywhere from 10-12 people, plus moderators. The group is all women...all women who are also of the same 'old school'. They for the most part have their husbands at home (two husbands just passed away), and they take care of them with little outside help. Its just the way they were raised. The one man who visited the group a few times had put his wife into an assisted living unit because he no longer felt he could take care of her! (Off the subject, I know). I do plan on visiting with the doctor at my Dad's next appointment, as my Mom doesn't feel that he's really hearing what she's asking about meds, etc.


 Rather than an actual sleeping pill, our doc put my FIL on Xanax to help him sleep and it worked pretty well up til the last 3 weeks of his life."
My FIL passed over this afternoon,"He was completely ambulatory and living on his own just 9 weeks ago. His rate of decline has surprised even the Hospice nurses that were so very wonderful to all of us. He passed at 3:30 this afternoon. It's been a very hard and long road, with the last two weeks requiring round the clock care with dosing medications and other things.....but it's all over with now. No more pain, no more frustration that his body was working against him, that he couldn't find that word or say it when he did know the word. I'm sorry this is so harsh and to the point, but I'm exhausted....and my goats are in labor, so I have another long night ahead of me, but at least it's about the start of life this time. Thank you for being here. I'll be returning to help with this forum as well once I've had some time to recover.","I'm so sorry to hear this. It has been so hard on all of your family. Of course you're exhausted, take care of you, you've done all you could do for your FIL My thoughts and prayers are w/ you and your family. God bless. Alice.


 Thank you all. I'm so sorry that I haven't been back till now. The evening that my FIL passed, we had three baby goats born - talk about the cycle of life. It was both exhilarating and exhausting! Plus I'm trying to get back to my 'duties' as Lyme disease forum moderator. Although that was the most intense, exhausting, and even frustrating 2 months I think I've spent, it was also very fulfilling, knowing that we gave my FIL the most comfort and the most caring situation that he could have been in during that time in his life. We came away with many, many wonderful little times to remember him by. So I wouldn't have missed that for the world! Thank you all again for being here for me during this fast and scary ride through Alzheimers.


 Sure! If you have some extra sleep in your back pocket, I could sure do with some of that!! LOL! Actually, both hubby and I are doing quite well. We know (no matter what others are saying ) that we did all that we could and did well at taking care of my FIL in his last days. Thank you so very much for all that you have done - including all those emails to me personally! It was very helpful to be able to divulge personal details without knowing that they were put up for the entire world to see!! LOL!


 Oh Darn!! You handed over that cast iron skillet! I had hoped someone would help! LOL! Sooooo, I just got back from town and had picked up the mail while I was there - and you'll never guess what I got!! I'd laugh, but it's really not funny! I go my 'Welcome packet' from Alz.org Seriously???? I contacted them 9 weeks ago and never got a response back! Not even one! I was promised that I would be contacted by someone either later that day or the next day - at the latest - their words, not mine. Three weeks later - when we were reeling from the fast decline that my FIL was having- I called back and told them I was never contacted. They apologized and said again that someone would contact me. Again not a word from them. And now I get a welcome packet???? After he's passed away? That's just rude!


 I'm so sorry Traveler...my condolences to you and your family. Take all the time you need.


 I'm so sorry to hear of this Traveler; my heart goes out to you and your husband. The greatest thing is that you gave your dear father in law so much love and caring throughout his life and while he was living with you. Thinking about you and sending warm hugs.


 HUGGSS Traveler! I am so so sorry, my condolences. Is there anything you need? A shoulder via internet? Hugss again


 *hands over the cast iron skillet* LOL I do have sleep for you see j/k I am glad I could help. I was going to email you but I forgot your email address pardon my fogs. My mind likes to temporary wonder off :p"
"self diagnosed, is it possible in the beginning?","Is it possible for a person to realize that they are not taking care of bill paying, or not taking care of personal hygiene. Is it possible to know about them, but not doing anything regardless of knowing? I am talking about myself. My family can see these things too, and it doesnt matter to me that they do. I just dont care. I am so worried sometimes about what lies ahead in this situation. Will I suddenly not know LOTS of things? My husband is not a caretaker at all. However I should add that for over a year he has taken care of all grocery buying. I dont leave my house except to doctor, and he is always with me. I am confused right this minute. I dont know why I would even share this, except I want to know is it common for a person to know these things and diagnose themselves????","thanks for responding Lonie. I agree with what you say. I see a new RA next week and am having nerve block in my back friday by my neuro. doctor. I appreciate your responding.....Cathy


 Have you started any new medications recently? When my Mom started showing signs of dementia, she was a very avid computer user, especially with email. She started saying she was having trouble with the computer, and had people come out to fix it. When they couldn't find anything, she said they didn't know what the problem was. She would laugh and say it was probably the ""user."" Actually, she was correct...that is when I really started noticing. She started getting lost in the car. My Dad helped hide her confusion, but then one day she had some problems from not eating, and it landed her in the hospital. She wouldn never let me near the bills, and I'm certain it was because I would find out about her confusion. Sure enough, I found late bills (not common at all for my Mom!) and unpaid bills. Then she started forgetting how to cook. Simple tasks like grooming and getting dressed were very cumbersome. I think you should get a thorough check up from your doctor, and talk about the issues you are dealing with. Maybe it's a new medication or maybe you have something such as a Urinary Tract Infection which if not treated, can cause memory issues. So please, get checked and let a professional start helping you work through your symptoms to find the true cause. Take care and keep us updated.


 What tests do you get to find out if you have early Alz?"
I feel different,"I really want somebody to tell me that I have nothing wrong with me. That's too much to ask for...I know. I'm somewhere between scared, sad & I can tell. I know I need to talk to my doctor. I have had things leading up to now that I didn't think meant much of anything. .they do now. When a word is spelled to me, I can't write it correctly. I have them repeat it 2 or 3 times...I still can't put the letters on paper as they were spelled. Sometimes I sit with my purse on my lap & I don't know where to put it. When I wake up at my usual 2 am, I'm up. I try so hard to remember who's home or am I alone. I know my pin# at the ATM. I just get out of line until I'm aline because I don't know where to insert my card. The list goes on. No new meds. Diabetic using insulin that takes every last brain cell I have to take the right dose...dangerous. ..I know. I do have a method for that so I'm ok. I'm 52. Two of my aunts passes away having had Alzheimer's. I stay home because I don't feel right. Does anybody feel like this besides me? Are these 'early' signs? This is what Alzheimer's is like...isn't it! I am scared and sad. Please post anything for me. Ty :( -Mary","Thank you, Sherry. I made an appointment with my doctor. I'll be ok. I appreciate your fast reply. I'm just scared and that's makes things worse. I'll read some more pists. I hope I can help somebody, even if its just to listen or say hello. Ty again, Mary


 Unfortunately we can't tell you what is wrong with you because we are not doctors. But you do need to discuss this with your doctor. There can be many reasons why you are experiencing these things and the only way to find out is to be tested.


 I know you're scared (totally understandable!) and I'm glad you made the appt. please keep us updated okay? Take a deep breath and try to relax."
Sleeping all the time,"Happy New Year everyone. I'm just trying to be optimistic even though I know each new year brings more downhill situations. Last I wrote in, my mom was given galantamine 8mg. She took it for 2 months and showed no signs of improvement. She started to sleep all the time. Her doctor then took her off and said we've run out of drugs for her to combine with Namenda since the others gave her other side effects. I thought my mom would be more alert once she was taken off of this medication but I was wrong. The only time she's awake is for her 3 meals. Well not for the whole time anyways. She's closed her eyes and fallen asleep eating her cereal before. Yesterday was a beautiful day (I live in Los Angeles) so I took her to the park to take a nice walk. She was dragging her feet and even closed her eyes during the 15 minutes we spent there. I then pulled her back to my car which she didn't want to cooperate and sit in the car fully. I spent another 10 minutes trying to scoot her in far enough so I could close the door and put on her seat belt. I then took her for a joyride for about 45 minutes. I just didn't want her back in the house and in her bed yet again. She dozed off and on and when she would wake up she would jolt suddenly and try to unlock the door to get out. I was so frustrated and finally told her that if she took her seat belt off I will crash my car. Since my mother is terrified of dying (she's scared of most everything these days) she then sat still. What can I give her to give her more energy? She currently takes Stalevo/Mirapex/Namenda/Norvasc and has been on the same meds for over 2 years. I'm scared to think her brain is shutting down so that's why she's sleeping so much. Nothing seems to stimulate her. She sits in front of the TV and will nod off there too. Another weird symptom she's had recently is watery eyes. I first thought she was crying but she said it hurts to open her eyes sometimes so she closed them and then tears drip down. Once her eyes closes then she just falls asleep. I love my mom dearly and I feel so helpless to see her get worse. It's like watching a very slow moving tragic movie.","Her last blood test was normal. It was done about 7 months ago. I actually thought she was under medicated for her parkinson meds because she's shaking now and then somewhat usually when she's nervous. I know the medications will make her sleepy but without them she would be shaking violently. I read articles that say drinking coffee will make the brain active but it just makes her worse because of her parkinsons. My mom was drinking up to 8 cups of coffee in her mid 40's to 50's and still she has dementia and parkinsons. What do experts know? Is there a cure for any disease out there? Just think about it. If there were then there will be a lot of researchers out of work and pharmaceutical companies out of business. They don't want that to happen so they keep getting grant $ and lead the public on with their slow findings. EVERYDAY I tell how to wipe herself after she urinates but to throw it inside the toilet but she never does. She even holds it for a minute inside the bowl while she's still sitting there or she throws it to the ground. She also likes to play with water. She's constantly turning on the faucet and then leaves the bathroom with the water running. I went out to do a quick errand once and the water was running at full blast. She also keeps herself busy by touching her comforter at her bed. It's like she's making her bed but she's not. She's just flipping it up and down and then touches the corners. That's how she always ends up peeing before she reaches the bathrooms. She's too distracted to go so in her head she wants to play with the comforter but her body can't hold it any longer. It is beyond frustrating. Sometimes I don't think she knows what I'm saying to her at all.


 I read that it can cause heart problems. Is that true? We don't have too many neurologists near where we live so we are stuck with her. She would put my mom back on if I ask her to. I just don't know if it really works on her or not.


 I have no heart problems & I've been on it nearly 9 yrs now......When she starts having bm's then you'll get rid of the panties & stay with adult pull ups.......They can be thrown out....


 Thank you all for your input. I just called her neurologist and she will put my mom back on the medication since it doesn't seem to be the reason for her sleepiness. My mom does have eyedrops for allergy. I will contact her family doctor to see if dry eyes may be the problem instead.


 Update - my mom is officially off of Galentimine a month ago. She developed urine retention where she would pee only after 10 hours of holding it in. Then.. pee in her diaper when it was time to come out. Speaking of diaper, I got her the kind from Walmart and they work pretty well. Thank you for the suggestion. I bought an inflatable ball and have been tossing it around with her while she sits. She seems to enjoy the exercise and her coordination is pretty good. She was having trouble getting up from a sitting and flat position so I had her doctor increase her Mirapex dose by .25mg and it's working. I've had a really bad cold for the past week and unfortunately being my mother's only caretaker means she gets it from me too. It's unavoidable.


 Everyone is different so I'm glad it really works in your favor. Now you know it does work for you. Nothing seems to work for my mom. I tried to get her off of namenda many times but I'm never really sure if it's the drug that's making her a bit normal than usual or she would be like this anyways.


 Hello Bella.. FIRST OF ALL I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE A VERY STRONG, WONDERFUL DAUGHTER. SECOND IS I Know exactly what you are going through. sitting here and reading your words felt as if you are living in my home. for the past for years i have felt so along, so confused, so sad, and not to mention of frustrated. for the very first time ever i feel like im not alone and that's because of you SO THANK YOU .... the only difference is im a stay at home mom with two small children. my baby boy who is six years old has autism. My mom was a very very very strong woman and now she is like an infant. its so heart breaking and sad. everything you said i have been through. until a month ago we was not sleeping at all. she would be up for days. she uses the bathroom all over the house, i try to keep up with her but as soon as a get a little busy with the kids, she pee pees everywhere and also does number two and then she puts it on the walls or in her mouth and eyes and hair. at times i feel like im about to loose my mind.


 I stopped coming to this forum a while ago because there were very few people here. It seems there are more here now and I love the support. My mom was diagnosed almost ten years' ago with Alzheimer's dementia. It has been a VERY long, frustrating, depressing, extremely sad journey. When she was first diagnosed, we tried to keep her at her place which was only one mile from my home. But the phone calls began, many times a day, begging me to come right away, the TV doesn't work and I'd run there and find she took the batteries out of the remote and stuck them under the recliner seat and then deny doing it. We went through this for about five months until she asked to move in with me and of course, I took her in. I never really asked my husband, after all, this is my mom, what was I to do? By the way, I do have two sisters that live locally. Mom lived with me for a year and I nearly lost my mind. I gained 35 pounds and developed SO many health issues including having to have angioplasty. I finally realized I couldn't go on like this. My sisters both refused to take her so I looked for a place for her. When I found a place and the night before her move, one sister stepped up and took mom for 3 and 1/2 years. From there, mom went to assisted living, a lovely place, where my other sister works, she is an RN and so she could watch over mom on her evening shift. Now, just last week, we moved mom into skilled nursing. She has run out of money and I had to apply for Medicaid. We are very fortunate that the facility is really a lovely place where the residents are taken care of very well, but...it is still a nursing home and she is on the alzheimer's dementia floor. I find it really disturbing seeing all the people with dementia and most of them are functioning at a lower level than my mom. Mom has been on Aricept and Namenda since her diagnosis and I believe it has kept her from declining too rapidly. She has definitely declined. There are many times that she has no idea who I am, she becomes VERY confused. All she has done for the past four years is lie in bed listening to the TV, that is it. Even though she was at a facility that had social activities all day long, she refused to participate. I am not sure if she is sleeping or just lying there with her eyes closed, listening to the TV. She has trouble with too much input, causes confusion. My mom turned 91 in January. I try to tell myself that she is happy. She made the move from assisted living to the skilled nursing facility amazingly well. It was last Thursday. Since then, she is now showing signs of more confusion and anxiety. I am meeting with the psychiatrist tomorrow and the physician to discuss her medications. Hopefully, she will settle in soon. I am ashamed to say this, but the most difficult thing for me to do is to spend time with her. I visit her very often, at least four times a week, sometimes three times a week, but I do not stay for long, usually 1 and 1/2 hours. The repetition just gets the best of me, she wears me down. She also says things that bring back some pretty awful memories of when I was young. Mom was a holocaust survivor and came away from that with such tremendous rage which she took out on her children. we were verbally as well as physically abused most of our childhood. Worse than that, we were ignored. Believe me, I understand it as an adult, the horrors she experienced, just cannot imagine what she went through, but as a child, all I knew was I never felt loved. She took care of us, but didn't know how to nurture. My dad died when I was only 13. So now, when she says things like ""you are good for nothing"" I really have a hard time with that. I do understand she doesn't mean it, it is the disease talking and I don't hold it against her. I am there for her and I will continue to be there for her. The facility is less than ten minutes from my home, so I have her close to me and I can keep a watchful eye over her, letting the staff know that family is very involved. Sorry this is so long and thanks for letting me get my feelings out, Miriam xoxo


 Thanks so much Alice, for responding and letting me know your feelings. This disease is SO difficult, especially for the family members. My mom is very aware of her memory loss, at least most of the time. It is so strange to hear her say ""I'm sorry, I don't remember. That is my problem. My head is empty."" I can't help her. I can't fix her. Yes, I can love her and care for her. It's SO hard to just sit and watch her fade away. I believe it was Nancy Reagan who called it ""the long goodbye""...it certainly is. blessings, Miriam


 Hello, Just a thought but when was the last time you had blood levels done on your mom? how about B levels chem panels. What are the doctors telling you about her? Maybe she needs less medication if possible......Not knowing your mom it sounds serious and like over medicated maybe.....try talking to docs.....


 Therepudic Galentimine is 24 mg a day.......I have vascular dementia & take 16 mg a day & it works you just need more time with a higher dose & get a new Dr........Try her with some depends or Assurance from WalMart they are cheaper than depends...


 As for the diaper solution, we don't have assurance at the Walmart by us. I also found an easier solution. I have her wear her underwear still and have the diaper over it. This way the diaper can stay clean if she doesn't have an accident and can still wear the same one over and over again since it has the underwear as the extra layer. The underwear can be washed.


 She can have Dry Eye syndrome which is why her eyes are tearing up. It can also be why she feels tired all the time. I have Dry eye and when my eyes act up, all I want to do is close them and for some reason it makes me sleepy :) Also too, with AD sometimes the mind gets ""set"" on one thing. Sort of like a broken record and sleeping may be hers. It can also mean that her mind's way of coping with the ever increasing confusion around her. Her sleeping a lot can be from so many things.


 SnowyLynne: How do you know that the drug is working for you? Have you gone off of it before to notice a difference? What I mean is do you think it's the drug that's making you function so well all these years or maybe it's something else that's working or just your healthy lifestyle. I asked the neurologist if there was something my mom can take to wake her up and she said there is but that drug will just cause more side effects. What a shocker huh?


 I have been off the drug a month,& i really noticed a downward spiral,but sfter going back on it WALA!! i'm back to where I wuz,lol.....


 You are a terrific daughter. I wish I have the patience to take my mom out like you do. My mom falls asleep taking a walk at the park so that's an experience that I don't want to go through again while we were pretty far away from my car to walk back to. She has this annoying habit of NOT wanting to pee in the toilet. Whenever I try to help her take her pants down she grabs hold of them for dear life and pulls them back up. I go through this with her about 15 minutes in the morning before we leave in the morning to her daycare center and me to work and then again before bedtime. I get to the point where I just scream and cry from the lack of cooperation from her. She can hold it in for about 8-10 hours. My fear is of her having an accident in her underwear even though I have her diapers to bed. Still, I don't want her to think it's ok to let it out there and not go to the bathroom anymore. There are only so many meds out there for dementia. She's tried them all and the side effects is worse than what it's suppose to help so Namenda is the only one she takes. I've aged a lot in the past 5 years and my health has gone downhill. People always say to take care of yourself first but let's be realistic and know that there is not enough time in the day to pamper myself. If we are both sick at the same time I doubt I'll go take medications that will make me sleepy and go sleep it all leaving her alone. So... I just suck it up and let the illness run its course and force myself to go on. Anyways, I think you do a great job and because of this, your father will be around much longer and you will be happy that you provided this great secure environment for him.


 I'm so sorry but I didn't know about your reply until now. How is it going at your house? You have it way tougher than me. Life really is not fair. My sister has a great life and of course that being said she will not disrupt that and help me more with my mom. I'm tired of complaining to people about her. It is what it is. I was put on this earth to take care of my mom and seeing what the alternative is (nursing home) I rather do it alone and be happy knowing I was there for her and got to spend time with her.


 Miriam, Your post just brought me to tears. I just feel so bad about the whole situation. I'm so sorry for what your mother has gone thru, I feel so badly about what you have gone thru. None of it was easy for either of you. I know it was hard for you to share your feelings, but I'm glad you did. I tend to let things build inside of me and it effects my health, too. I think we need to release things that upset us or make us feel ashamed. We each have reasons for feeling something, even if others don't 'know' or 'understand' the reason. Many family relationships are so complicated and hard for outsiders to understand. It is hard for us to understand, and we are living it. You have been a very good daughter, even under trying circumstances. You are a very good woman. Remember that, pls. My prayers and thoughts are w/ you and your DM. God bless. Alice."
Perspective on Alzheimer's disease,"Dear all, I just wrote an article (based on personal experience) to help explain Alzheimer's to people who don't know much about the disease. It's short and simple and maybe you could find it helpful. The issue is obviously much more complicated however this can be a good start, especially if you would like to send others info that would be easy to read and hopefully encourage them to give you better support. The article is here: http://forestrain.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/cruel-time-warp/ If it helps even one person a little bit, I'm satisfied. Wishing you best of luck, lots of patience and lots of strength.", 
Mom is bipolar and also has early onset dementia,My mom is bipolar and also has early onset dementia. She is still pretty functional. Right now her medicine is messed up. She is hearing things. She thinks everyone is whispering behind her back. She makes up whole conversations. I am having her psychiatrist change her meds but it is complicated by all her allergies and other health conditions. She thinks all the conversations are about having her committed. She is terrified that I or my sister will have her placed in a hospital. I nor my sister have talked about this at all. But the paranoia is starting to make people lose patience with her. Not everyone in my household understand mental illness as well as I do. My husband has been patient to now but to see her basically say that I am trying to make here think she is crazy and she doesn't know why is starting to wear on him. I don't know what to do. I have even tried to tape record my room so when she comes in here I can prove I was not talking about her but she still doesn't believe me. If things don't get better I will have to do something. Just looking for some support. This is a terrible feeling. I want to help her. I hate that she thinks I could hurt her like this. I know it is the diease and to her but it is still hard hearing it.,"Having dementia is tough, add in bipolar and it doubles the anguish. My heart goes out to you. Hopefully the pdoc will find the right combination because I KNOW this has to be hard on you and everyone involved. My Gma had dementia and lived with us. For some reason she always thought my daughter was stealing from her, hated her or went into her room....my daughter was only 8. That made me feel horrible because I knew my daughter would do no such thing but my Gma insisted. When they get something in their head, it's like a loop, reason doesn't work because their reasoning skills are gone. I sincerely hope things work out and that right med combo can be found, not only for her sake but for everyone involved."
Alzheimers and Surgery,"My 92 year old Grandmother Evelyn fell on Monday. She fell right on her elbow and shattered it requiring her to have surgery. Before she went into surgery on Tuesday, she repeated herself often but we had all gotten used to it and just answered her every time she'd ask something even if it was for the 3rd or 4th time. She has been diagnosed with Alzheimers and is in the mild to moderate stages. Or she was. Since the surgery she has been unable to put words together. She struggles to speak and last night when I talked to her on the phone, she forgot she was on the telephone altogether. This is a woman who looked and acted like a 70 year old, and still lives independently (but probably won't now). We now have to have her under 24 hour care. They did not use Anesthesia to do her surgery but they did a block. I guess if I understand it right she was awake but sedated during the surgery. The doctors told me that once she was home her condition would improve because she would be in familiar surroundings and not in the hospital. She has improved a little but not much. I am curious about anyone elses experiences with Alzheimers and surgery. I've read up a little on this and I'm not liking what I am reading.","Is she on pain medication? When my Gma broke her arm in a fall, they put her on Vicodin and it confused her even more.


 My mom was sedated on versad and Femtenyl? for dental surgery, She was knocked out for 20 hours. We tried multiple times to wake her but she looked so happy to be sleeping so we just kept a watch on her until she finally opened her eyes the next morning. It's been a week now and her mental state is still the same. She's still in La La land like before. I wouldn't say it's worse though. She does seem to be weaker in the legs so she's having trouble walking without a lot of assistance. I think any drug is poison to the brain and body. If you started off normal anything can happen afterwards. You were essentially invaded so I'm not surprised if you end up worse off than before. Modern medicine. Don't get me started. It's the typical solution. Fix the problem and worry about the consequences later.


 I'm sorry for your poor grandmother, and the family. I know how hard this is for you. I learned, while taking care of my mother, that anything different from her normal routine would throw her off. In my fourth year with her, she'd gotten out of bed at some point, and ended up sitting on the floor at the side of her bed. I found her at 7:00 when I went in to get her dressed. She was in the hospital several days, and at first she kept her eyes closed, and didn't talk at all, and when she finally did, it was in a little girl's voice. She acted like she didn't know what the food they brought her was for, but when I'd hold a spoonful up to her, she'd open her mouth and take it. She remained ""off"" like that until after they'd sent her to the nursing home to get her back on her feet. When I finally took her home, she was as she'd been before this all happened. She liked to go for rides with me, and she enjoyed people visiting. But most visitors were strangers to her, and even though she enjoyed them, and the rides, once everything was back to normal, she'd get really weird for a few days. What your grandmother went through would be traumatic for any of us, but to her, because of age and the disease, it's even more so, and she'll react to it. If she's still in her own home, even with the 24 hour care, I believe she'll be her old self before too long. Best wishes for her, and you.


 My gmother was diagnosed with mild slow progression until she had her lung surgery. I thought it was just the meds for pain, but that has been eliminated. Now we are seeing a cardiologist to ensure that the heart meds and bp meds are accurate for her. The MRI shows more microstrokes. Make sure that she is drinking plenty of water and that she doesnt have a uti. She is independant and was capable of this until the surgery. Her surgery was a neccessity. I will not take to sedated procedures lightly because I now believe that it has a negative effect on the progression of dementias."
New to this forum - need advice,"I'm not sure where to begin. This is my first post to this forum. We are regulars on the Hep C forum. My husband is a liver transplant patient February 3, 2011, had a triple bypass in November 2012 and over the years I have experienced him at his worse due to medication sensitivities. My husband is 65. Last Sunday night I had to call 911 because my husband was having conversations with imaginary people, hallucinating and he became very aggressive. He was hospitalized for 3 days. This is not the first time he's experienced this (although he's never been aggressive before). His mother, in her 80's, before her death, had this same 'fuzziness'. This has been happening over the past 6-9 months (not every night - sometimes only once a week...but recently, it's more and more common). He's fine during the day, and in the afternoon/evenings it's like a switch turns off. He paces, or sleeps and shouts, does strange things, basically is not there. Sundowners! He was examined by a neurologist in the hospital and he was told he has early stages of dementia. Exactly what does that mean? I've done lots of research but it all seems so vague. He was prescribed Serequel by his neurologist - and told it would either make him less confused or more confused. My husband is on so much medication due to the liver transplant, heart issues and diabetes...... I appreciate your time in reading this long post - any advice would be helpful. Thank you. Pam","Is Sundowners Alzheimers? What type tests are performed to confirm vascular? My husband had 2 CAT scans and an MRI of the brain - the neurologist said he only saw normal aging.


 http://sundownerfacts.com/sundowners-syndrome/


 Any kind of injury or major trauma, like surgery can worsen and even speed up the issues with dementia. My FIL fell twice in the last 3 months of his life and after each fall, he got quite a bit worse. It's possible that some of the dementia could be due to all the meds that he's on too. Look up the medicines online and read through all the precautions and such carefully. You can use a drug interaction checker - found online as well - to help you get through all of this more quickly. I like using drugs dot com, as they seem to have the most complete listings, but there are others.


 Welcome to our forum. There are two main types of dementia: Vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. Here's a website that tells you more about vascular dementia http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vascular-dementia/DS00934 What sort of information are you seeking?


 Sundowners is a symptom of Alzheimer's and dementia. It is not a separate condition on it's own because it's usually seen in dementia patients. Vascular dementia can be hard to diagnose but if it's caused by strokes or ""mini"" strokes, damage can sometimes be seen on testing such as a CT scan and MRI. Alzheimer's usually produces plaque like deposits on the brain and may not show up until much later. If his testing came back good, sometimes dementia can also be seen in people who are deficient in minerals or vitamins and possibly from medications. Did you happen to notice an increase of confusion when starting a certain medicine?


 My Dad began having symptoms of Alzheimer's not long after having surgery to place a stent in a blood vessel leading to his heart. He was put on 7 or 8 medications following surgery, most of which had such horrible side effects that we weaned him off of all of them within a year. We thought his Alzheimer's symptoms might relate to these medications, but the symptoms never went away and in fact became worse once Dad was off the meds. His family doctor did some tests for dementia (drawing the clock and other diagrams, etc.) and referred him to a neurologist after he was unable to complete several of the tests. The rest is history. I frequently wonder if the surgery and medications brought the Alzheimer's to the forefront earlier than it would have appeared without them, or made more pronounced what, looking back in time prior to his surgery, may have been the very beginning of symptoms. I've read that the trauma of surgery can cause mental issues to become more pronounced, though I don't know if this is true. He hallucinates (people, kids, animals, contractors working on his house, walls falling down, etc.), has sundowner's syndrome most evenings, is sometimes up half the night rummaging through drawers, pulling his bedcovers off, etc. Dad also takes Seroquel, along with Exelon patch and Levodopa/Carbidopa. I don't think we know anymore whether he's better off with the meds, or would be better off without them. Sometimes I wish we could just stop all of them and see what happens!"
refusing to eat,Hi i am new to this group and i am taking care of my 90 year mother in law. She has advanced stages of Alzheimer. Lately she has gotten to where she will not eat and it is a huge struggle to get her to eat enough to take her medication. She also has been holding her throat alot. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I just don't know what else to do for her. She has been to the doctor and i keep getting told there is nothing physically wrong with her.,"We give liquid calories to fill in what isn't consumed in solid food. There are nutrition shakes that dieticians can recommend to replace food (I would ask, not just pick something off the shelf). Difficulty with eating and eventually not eating at all is unfortunately a common symptom. There's probably nothing wrong with your mom at all – except that she has Alzheimer's disease.


 Hi Gloria, That sounds really hard. We're not quite at that stage yet - nutrition shakes still work although there is more and more resistance to food. I've been given to understand that at complete resistance to food and drink one puts in a feeding tube. Obviously no one wants to get to that point but maybe its needed... In our case we've needed meds to deal with the combativeness - that began a long time ago. As long as we have the ""happy pills"" we can convince her to do what is needed, without them there is just no way. Maybe you need a different med combo? Wishing you lots of strength! Forest Rain http://forestrain.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/cruel-time-warp/


 Hi Gloria, I think it's good to call things as they are - what's gross is gross. The situation you are describing is hard and sad. I can't say that I know what you are going through because I have not (yet) experienced those stages. We may, eventually. I can say that I empathize, as I am sure everyone else here does. I wish you lots of strength and fortitude. It sounds like you are doing an amazing job with a difficult situation. I hope you are proud of yourself. Even if your mother in law is unable to appreciate, it's an excellent example to the people around you. Wishing you well, Forest Rain


 Hi Grumpy Twin and welcome, First, let me say I am NOT a healthcare professional, but I do have a mom with Alzheimer's. Not sure what stage she is in, going on her tenth year since diagnosis, probably at end of midstage or beginning of end stage. In the early years after her diagnosis, I spent hours, days, weeks, months reading about dementia and Alzheimer's. From what I remember, in end stage, the Alzheimer patient stops eating. I also remember something about Alzheimer's causing the inability to swallow. Could this be why she is holding her throat? You might want to try chopping her food into small bits, or mashing things like mashed potatoes. Are you caring for mom at home? If so, have you contacted the Alzheimer's Association? They do have a support hot line and are very informative. I wish you well, Miriam


 Hi Miriam and forestrain, I am a nurses aide and yes i am caring for her at home. We have tried every form of food to give her..........puree, baby food ,cutting it in to tiny bites and still not eating it........We give her boost but once again she is refusing all forms of food and drink.I have read several articles on Alzheimer and have gone to the Alzheimer site. To top all this off she has gotten combative again she no longer will walk so we take her to her bedroom in her wheel chair and when we do try to have her walk she decided she is just going to sit down with no chair to sit down on catching us off guard She also seems to be having a hard time breathing and all of this has been told to her doctor and she put her on Lortab exliar which is doing nothing for her. Thank You for your input. Gloria


 Hi It is very hard. She has been on meds for some time for the combativeness and has recently had it increased........not sure my husband wants to put in a feeding tube as she would pull it out causing more harm. She has a super pubic cath in and we have had to go to one piece pj's for her because of that and her.... .not meaning to sound gross........but digging her bowel movemets out resulting in a mess everywhere. Thank You Gloria


 hi friend u must have to take care of ur mother in law"
Alzheimers _keepsake aide_,Good morning my name is Reuben Giovanni a Senior at Auburn University. I am currently working on an aide for Alzheimer's for a senior project and need expert opinions and opinions in general. Do keepsake boxes work in helping to serve as reminders??,"Thank you. Have you heard about the healing properties of coconut oil being used on alzheimers studies show that it has the potential to improve and also sustain the memory of the patient. So what are your thoughts if a keep sake box introduced early with a form of coconut oil was included?


 Good morning thanks for the input, any ideas on a keepsake aide presented early to help with memory if items were presented in the morning and before bed when the brain is most plastic?


 In the early stages perhaps but once the disease progresses they will forget what these items are as well as what memory they are connected to.


 Yes, I've heard of coconut oil but its one of those things. It might not work for everyone who has AD. But it has possibilities."
mom being asked to move out of memory care,"My mom has been in a memory care facility for 10 months. In that period of time, mom has fallen at least 10 times. Most recently, mom fell 5 times in a 10 day period. Now the facility has met with me and asked me to find a new place for mom, something like a residential care home, so she's in a smaller setting. Can they legally ""make"" her leave? I was under the impressions that mom would be able to live out the rest of her life in this facility. I don't feel they are living up to the care they said she'd get. I really don't look forward to moving her, as this will cause much turmoil in her life, and she wouldn't understand why or where she was.","Yes, that is tough stuff. My Mom's memory care facility is only about 40 people, and they have quite a big staff, so it's manageble for them. And, if she worsens -- there is a facility on the bottom floor for more help; kind of like residential care. Residential care homes are quite nice, but just know that if your Mom is on hospice, many will not accept hospice patients. Also, go and check some of the residential care homes out and as thebrothersmother suggested, find a support group that can help you. Your Mom might thrive better in a smaller home; I had a grandparent that was in a smaller home, and it was very nice, and she enjoyed it because they gave her more attention. Take care, and keep in touch. Carol


 Oh how difficult an upheaval for both of you. Is there an Alzheimer's support group near you thay may know more about these situations?


 Your main concern shouldn't be whether they can legally move her. You should be happy that they suggested this so she will get better care elsewhere. Yes she will probably get scared at the beginning of a new place but at least she will still be one piece. Of course that's if you get her to a better place than the one she's at now. Yeah it's a tough call. No one take care of your parents better than you nor care to."
Is this a normal symptom?,My mom is an early onset dementia patient. I have posted something similar to this before but I cannot for the life of me find the post to bring the topic back up. I want to know if anyone else's person they care for remembers things that cannot possibly have happened. My mom will watch a TV show that is airing for the first time and say she has seen it. Is this a common symptom?,"Thank you so much. Sorry to bother you.


 I cannot say my mom does the same thing but I can tell you that Alzheimer's causes a great deal of confusion and that might be why she thinks she saw it before. Sadly, it is very difficult for us to know what we can listen to and what to ignore. This disease is SO much harder on the family than the patient. Nancy Reagan said it best when she called it the long goodbye. I wish you well, Miriam


 Here's your post: https://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=8&m=2629000


 No bother at all :)


 Hi Teddtlove, In my experience everyone is different. There are common symptoms but no ""normal"". The only thing to do is see what works best for your mom and the people around her. Does it matter that she thinks she already saw the show? If she gets upset maybe she should do something else. If she takes it easy maybe you can turn it into a game and have her tell you what is about to happen. The only thing that really matters is that she feels good and calm and so do you. If she is right or not doesn't really matter. Just do what works for you and don't worry!"

Simple Puzzle  to Determine if One has Alzheimers,"I had to put that address in the search bar because it wasn't coming up. It's an interesting and easy puzzle, but for people with memory issues, I can see how this would pose a problem. Perhaps this will work: Thanks for sharing!","Thanks so much for that --- thankfully I was able to do it!!


 Phew! The first time I tried it, I must have 'lost' a piece of the puzzle by swiping it too forcefully to the side of the page...and I couldn't complete it because of the 'missing' piece... ..but I managed to do it the second time, and once more, just to be safe!;p That counts, right? Lol. I am going to have my mom try this, thanks! Scaredy Cat


 Ha, ha, I did the same thing Scaredy Cat; I was a little nervous when I couldn't get it right off the bat


 I suspect that it is true, It'smee, since it was sent first to my sister.At least, her report indicated that Alzheimers' patients are unable to solve the puzzle and that if you can solve it, you do not have the illness. I feel sure, however, that it has to do with the ability to see the color and shape of the pieces rather than other things. As long as you're worried about your mental health, I think you're safe. We are all probably listened to carefully by our physicians for safety about our overall health. Take care. It's Genetic Post Edited (It's Genetic) : 2/21/2012 1:43:06 AM (GMT-7)

 lol, yes, it is a tough job, and I appreciate all of the mods. They are awesome! Sorry I had to give it up, but so many other things came my way and I needed some space.


 Wierd - I've been diagnosed with alzheimer's in several clinical tests by medical experts in the field (UT Southwestern in Dallas) over the last 3 years (since Aug. 25, 2009). It took me less than a minute to complete the trivial puzzle. What is going on? Post Edited (Mark Estes) : 8/10/2012 10:20:03 PM (GMT-6)


 had me scared. i tried several times and kept missing a couple pieces. finally, i seperated all pieces off to the sides and got it.


 My sister sent this to me this a.m. I thought perhaps someone might want to try it. It's a simple puzzle which you are asked to put together. Alzheimers' patients are unable to do this; if you can do it, you have no problem.

 Thank goodness it wasn't timed!!!! S.C.


 Interesting test. I had no problem, even with Parkinsons. Dan


 OK, I was not able to do the puzzle but I have a good reason - my computer is so messed up that often the whole page does not load and in this case I did not seem to have enough puzzle pieces nor was I able to move the puzzle down so I could see the top of it. New computer tomorrow so I won't go looking for my room at the memory care yet. I will try with new puter. That's my story and I am sticking to it. Kitt


 You gave me a good giggle Kitt! :)


 Nice link at the bottom; I think the moderator's will be on to you shortly.


 Oh yes -- sorry just my old moderator detectors coming out, lol. Plus, for some reason I thought you were a mod -- sorry about that!


 Don't worry Scaredy I had the same problem... Sooo is that why i forget a lot? J/K I know its because of my chemotherapy and radiation


 It was a relief to be able to easily complete the puzzle. While I don't suspect that I have alzheimer's, I'm going in for an MRI tomorrow because I'm concerned about memory problems. I'm 63 and like most of my peers, have more and more short term memory problems. My friends and I all laugh about not being able to remember a word, and then 3 minutes later, it pops right up. But mine seems to be worse than most folks I know. Recently I have almost caused three wrecks. I have lupus and fibro, and know that brain fog is a common symptom. Years ago (maybe 10 or 12) I was diagnosed with small vessel disease, but was not told how little or how much, so we're going to find out tomorrow. It would be so nice to know what is going on. Of course, my hope is that the MRI finds only normal changes due to aging, and that all this is just brain fog. One of the recent posts here is about the frustration a woman is going through while caring for an older family member, and my greatest fear is in becoming that old person no one wants to be around anymore.

"my mom has dementia, what should I do?","My mom has had short term memory issues for several years. She lives at her home with my dad (who has his own issues). After yet another UTI & hospitalization, her memory is worse, confusion more pronounced. I am an only child & have to work full time to live. My husband is more or less ""retired"" & has been a godsend helping my folks. Both of my parents are adamant that they do not want to leave their home. My mom was just discharged from the hospital for sepsis from a UTI. She was a handful for hospital staff as she wandered around, pulled out IV lines, etc.The had to put a bed and personal alarm on her to keep track of her. I've resigned myself to the fact that my mom is not the mom I once knew; she is gone. It hurts horribly because the body is still here but the mind is gone..I know there is going to be a time where we can no longer care for my folks ourselves, so I'm looking into outside help to come in to assist with bathing and other tasks. At what point do I decide that they are no longer fit to be at home? I don't know what my specific question is, maybe I'm just rambling because I don't know what to do. What have others done?","We kept Mom (Widow) at home and hired a full time live in housekeeper. Mom was not bedridden and managed quite well with the housekeeper. It was very painful for all of us to see Mom losing it but gave us great comfort that she was being very well cared for. We never thought about the day she could no longer be at home. At age 99, she simply went to bed and didn't wake up. Do whatever possible to avoid a nursing home unless off course she becomes bedridden and needs extensive care. Focus on the here now. Take it one day at a time."
Help-advice for conversation w/Mom on moving to ALF,"I have not slept good in at least a week. My mom has Alzheimer's, has for years. Now the time has come where I know I have to move her. The battle continues in my head day in and day out. Not over the decision itself, I know this is what I have to do, but over the conversation with my Mom about it. I have done all the research. I found the facility. Known for being one one of the best in the country, and certainly in my area (Dallas/Fort Worth). The care she would receive there is so far above and beyond anywhere else. It isn't fancy. It may not have the luxurious feel of some of the places I've seen that make you feel like your entering a 5 star resort. But at the end of the day, its about the people, and the care she will receive, and I believe this is our place. My mom doesn't think she has any memory issues, or none that she will admit to. So Alzheimer's is the elephant in the room no one talks about . She's lost tons of weight, she doesn't take her meds (or believe she needs to), she loses track of place and time in conversation, not to mention not making much sense much of the time. Home health care has bought us some time, but I believe moving her into a community now, when she is still conversive and able to make friends will be the best. I have had advice all over the map on ""the conversation"". From, ""just say you're going on a trip to X and wind up there where she has no choice"" to ""tell her the dr wants her to stay a while at this center to get checked out"". I lean towards the honest approach. She is still my mother, and she deserves the respect of me sharing with her my concerns and that I believe fully in my heart that this will be the best thing for her and she will be happy there. I'm not sure if I want her to be part of the process, as far as ""showing her"" the facility first. Because I'm afraid of the chance she will hate it and rebel. Plus, I've toured a ton, and already feel in my heart this place has the best care. But I would like to hear examples from any of you that have been through this, and maybe help me reach a conclusion on my approach. Help!","Thank you for the advice. I plan on having the conversation with her today when I get off of work. I have a very heavy heart. I keep praying for the words to use. I want to be as honest and as positive as possible. I just hope I don't break down in tears.


 Yes, I can feel your pain. It's really tough and after my Dad passed away last year we knew that my Mom could not be by herself. We took the chance and moved her closer to my sisters and brother, because they could provide more support than I could. She was hardly eating even though we had 24 hour live in care, and she was down to 84 lbs because of dysphagia, a problem with swallowing. We went through some tough times after the move because she missed my Dad, moved to an unfamiliar place, etc. I can tell you that even though she has Dementia, there were some ""growing"" pains. The place we moved her has about 40 people in it, so it's smaller which is perfect for her. It took her a few months to feel comfortable, and now she loves where she lives and is really happy. My sisters and brother, nieces and nephews keep her very busy and I'm happy to report that she now weighs 110 lbs! I believe that the consistent watch over her, and making sure she eats etc. is the key to her happiness and weight gain. Her memory hasn't gotten any better, but heck, she's happy and not lonely at all. Take care and hope that the conversation went well. It's not easy...especially when you feel like you've become more of the parent.


 Yes, it is a very hard time for everyone involved. I wish you and her the best. You did the right thing by being honest with her.


 I took care of my GMA with dementia, I do sympathize. I found a couple of programs at home because of how sightful and smart Sherry is. She aimed and I followed hehe. As Sherry once told me, perhaps talking to DHS in your area. There are programs you may qualify for. I qualified for at home nursing 30 hours a month. Each place is different, but that was 30 hours I had to myself. I also found a nurse (at my doctor's office) and paid him with my own money for 6 hours a month at $15/hr. I also had my mother whom gave me 5 hours a week for free. My church gave us transportation and a companion when I had to go shopping or to my own doctor appointments or chemotherapy infusions. I refused to put GMA in a home til it was absolutely necessary, as I used to work in one and saw behind the scenes shall we say. I would of probably lost my mind if it wasn't for this forum and all the people here. I didn't have help at first, like I said Sherry aimed me to the right location and I only followed. If a facility is needed, when you are checking them out please do not make appointments, just show up to catch them at their worse. Talk to the residents, see if they like it there.


 Oh boy...do I ever know what you're going thru! My Gma was living with us for about 4 years when I had to make that decision. I had such a hard time bringing it up to her. But she knew something wasn't right with her mind. I have a lot of health issues so I pretty much told her along the lines of ""Gma, you know I love you. I love you very much but I think it's time for you to go into an assisted living center. You can be around people you're own age, socialize and make friends"" she was lonely because she moved in with us after living in a different state and she had no friends. And ""I am having a really hard time with my health at the moment and I can't be there for you like you need me to be. I will come every day to sit with you and visit (which I did)"" I already picked it out, toured the place before I brought it up to her. I took her there to check it out but I didn't give her an option to say no. I told her that this is her new home. It's a hard decision to make and even harder to bring up the topic. But I wish you and her the best.


 Have you talked to your mother yet? If so, how did it go?


 Thanks for your kind words of support Lonie. Red, I did talk to my mother. I can't even guess how many hours and days and weeks I have been consumed with this conversation. I sought advice everywhere I could think of, and ultimately, I went with my heart. I felt strongly that I wanted to be honest, at least not lie about it. It was very emotional for her, but she didn't get mad or shut down or argue with me, which was great. There were glimpses of the conversation which showed me some real positive signs. For that I am very thankful. Tomorrow will be phase two. I explained everything except that the plan is set, and we are moving next week. It is one thing for her not to dispute the need to move, but I'm now worried of how she will react to the time frame. It will be very hard, I know. especially going from her big, grand home to a little room. But I hope and pray in time (hopefully not too much) she will adjust and be happy. Love really hurts. But I guess its worth it, right?


 You'll be amazed how much easier it will be for your Mom going from the big house to a room -- I think my Mom was more confused in her house because she knew things needed to be done, she just didn't know what and where to begin.Plus she grieved for my father who took care of everything for her. Initially everything will be tough, I'm not going to say it isn't. My Mom called my sisters in the middle of the night and all day. She was scared, and the dementia didn't help. The staff was great and my sisters and brother were amazing. They were there at her beck and call. It took about 3 months until everything settled down and she was feeling like she knew where she was. I think moving quickly is a good idea. I'll be thinking about you. And good for you being honest. You are looking out for her best interest and keeping her happy, healthy, and safe. Hugs."
"Moment of clarity, shortly before dying","Both of my in-laws died of Alzheimer's. I watched their minds deteriorate to the point they didn't recognized close family members. But both, shortly before dying had a moment of clarity. My father-in-law no longer spoke and slept most of the time. But within weeks of his death, he was laying in bed resting and holding my mother-in-law's hand, when he opened his eyes, looked at her and said, ""You know, sweetheart... we've had a wonderful life together."" Clear as day. Then he returned to how he'd been, quietly sleeping all the time. My mother-in-law was so disoriented when Alzheimer's finally got a hold of her that she thought my wife was her older sister and eventually thought she was just the woman who came to do her laundry. (This really saddened my wife.) But within weeks of her death, she was sitting with other patients in the nursing home when my wife walked into the room. My mother-in-law put a big smile on her face and introduced my wife, saying ""Here's my daughter, Jennifer!"" Shortly afterwards her mind returned to full-time forgetfulness. Has anyone else heard of, or experienced, these types of moments of clarity that appear way out of character for an advanced Alzheimer's patient? Post Edited (IMJustCurious) : 6/25/2011 2:11:10 PM (GMT-6)","I believe my mom is in the end stages of the moderate stage or maybe the beginning stage of the end stage, just not sure. She spends her entire day in bed, lying with her eyes closed either listening to the TV or the radio. She does still speak, but really does not have much to say and if she tries to have a conversation, it's very hard for her to think of the words she wants to say. There are times, however, when out of nowhere, she will remember something and it is always something from the past, over 30 years ago and will talk about it and very much surprise us. And then there are those times when she looks at me and says ""are you married?"" and I tell her yes (for 31 years) and then she says ""do you have any children?"" My son is 1 of 7 grandchildren that she has and he was always her very special grandson. That is something that I just can't seem to get beyond. What makes me crazy is when she loses her memory about something one day and yet on another day, she recalls it. That simply doesn't make sense to me at all. I guess the entire disease simply doesn't make sense to me. They say it is more difficult for the family than for the AD patient and I would very much agree... be well Miriam


 My mom is in about stage 6 or 7, and has recently had 3 moments of clarity in a 4-month period. The first is when my father was with her at the hospital where she was temporarily admitted. She had a moment of clarity and asked him to get me and my sister to the hospital because she has something to say. She told us that she realizes she has alzheimer's and that she is going to die, that she is okay with it, and when she gets to the point where she is completely out of it to put her in a nursing home and go on with our lives. She talked in a clear manner, her eyes were different, her voice different, etc. More like how she used to be. She is out of it at all other times and doesn't even realize she has alzheimers. She thinks she still pays the bills and cooks the food, etc., which she hasn't done in years. So for her to ""wake up"" like that for a few hours was miraculous. I taped it. The next day she had no memory of it and was back to her normal self of sleeping most of the day and being oblivious to what was going on. The 2nd and 3rd incidents were similar, and also occurred at night. In the third, she thanked my Dad for all he has been doing to take care of her, and called him a saint. This was an unbelievable gift to my dad because he has become a full-time caregiver, but since she is unaware, he never gets any thanks. After this happened I looked on-line and found that these moments of clarity are not that rare, but they are not understood. That search is what led me to this website.


 I'm so sorry you and your family are going thru this. But yes a morphine pain pump at this stage would be better for her instead of injections. Do they have something like that there?


 I have taken care of people with Alzheimer's n find this very true, where they have that moment before passing over of clarity.


 The mind is capable of a great deal of things so it doesn't me surprise me that this could happen. I have never seen it personally, when my Gma died she was in ""the death rattle"" when I got to her side at the hospital. I'm sorry for your losses.


 Thank you, Sherry and Miriam, for your responses. Miriam, I can only imagine how sad and unsettling it is to see a once vibrant parent, now at a loss of understanding about what should be a familiar world. I'm not claiming to be an expert on Alzheimer's, but I'd like to offer two thoughts on the disease - one simple, one philosophical. First simple: When the actions and responses of my in-laws seemed illogical, I comforted my logical mind by viewing their condition this way. I told myself that their brain is slowly dying in chunks. And once a chunk dies, it loses its ability to contribute its portion of memory, function or abilities to the whole. Because certain memories, like being in the war, or the name of a spouse, ""live"" in many chunks, these deep and extensive memories can continue to thrive almost until the end. Now the philosophical one. I've been guided lately to start reading books about souls. The first book someone offered was Evolution Angel. It was life changing for me. Then another person suggested the Brian Weiss series. And now I'm reading Journey of Souls. I come from a strong religious background, but over time the lack of logical answers about the meaning of life drove me away from religious thinking all together. Reading these books has opened my eyes to some very real, ""logical"" answers to my questions. They may help you. What I think I ""know"" now is that people are a combination of matter (the physical body) and energy (the invisible entity that animates our bodies, retains our experiences and lives on after our physical bodies die. Some call it our spirit, others our soul, but I also think it is what we think of as our subconscious.) The conscious mind (our brain) is the gatekeeper between our conscious world and our souls. Everything that happens to us in our life gets immediately logged into our soul, but our brain only notices and remembers what it believes is important for us to retain during this life. As our gatekeeper brain dies, it loses what it's retained, but everything is still in our soul. That is why I think, when the brain is weakened by Alzheimer's, the soul is able to commandeer our physical bodies for a moment, when the soul ""sees"" that it would be a loving gesture to do so. I know this may sound contrived and far fetched, but so do all of the books I'm reading about souls that seem to ring so true to my logical mind. I hope in some small way I've helped to lighten your load and brought you some kind of light of hope that your loved one may be physically leaving, but she is still very much reachable through your soul and hers.


 Hi this is my first time on Alzheimer's page I spend my time on Hepatitis page as I have chronic liver disease. My mum-in-law is 83 was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 2/3 years ago, she was physically ok, used to walk round the residential home no trouble to anyone she wouldn't have conversations just agree with what ever you said. 2 weeks ago we went in to see her when she went to get out of bed her right leg wouldn't function, she was saying she had pain in middle of her chest & a back ache, but would then forget. My reason for asking for advise is that she was taken to our local hospital in U.K. was there a few days still conscious, they told us she had cancer right throug her body, sent back to the residential home, put on paliative pathway(end of life stage). She has not been awake since Sunday, sleeping (& snoring ) a special team we have over here called the McMillan nurses who deal end stage life come in & give an injection, morphine when she needs it, my question is do you think she should be the syringe drive which slowly releases morphine instead of waiting to see her flinching with pain? example being we cannot be with her 24/7 how do we knw if she needs a top up for nurses to called out, as she is not in a hospice only with care workers who have lots of patients shouting screaming walking in her room as door needs to be open when we are not there, my daughters, her granddaughters are not coping seeing her like this, it destroys me seeing my girls watch their nan like this. Sorry to waffle once again I find healingwell the best thing, I just wish I knew about it while I was drinking my self to death literally, I have been sober for 9 months now and will remain so, my girls are just getting over me having days to live, I feel so helpless for them. I just tell myself If something doesn't kill you then it can only make you stronger, but I am 48, the girls are in their teens Lots of admiration for all moderators involved in Healingwell Regards Sue


 Yes we have what is called a syringe driver which is given via a drip & slow releases of morphine. This is fitted by the end of life nurses, they know when end is getting very close, & top up a little more often so no pain at end stage, it does howevever bring the end a little closer, but next of kin is the person that has to agree to this, unfortunately my ex-bro-in-law is not here often, and hardly seen her during the 2 years of her Alzheimer's my daughters & I are there as often & as long as we can, the good news is when we get the phone call if we are not with her is that we live 5 minutes away from her nursing home Thanks for your reply


 My father had alzheimer and I had to place him in a nursing home with a locked unit for alzheimers. He became unable to talk for years and when his respirations were fast and shallow the home called me and I got there to spend time with him before he passed away. I held his hand and told him I loved him and that I will be ok when he leaves and I will see him again. He opened his eyes and looked right at me with such clarity and he whispered that he loved me to and thanked me for being there with him. Then he closed his eyes and stopped breathing. I will never forget that. Betsey"
struggling for a few years with diminished memory,"Hello all...My mother is 80 years old and has been struggling for a few years with diminished memory, focus, etc. She has been treated for depression for her entire adult lifespan and takes Prozac & Mirtazapine (Anti-Depressants), Trazadone & Lunesta (Sleep Meds) & Percocet (Pain). My Mom's confusion definitely gets worse within an hour or so after taking her ""nighttime regimen"" Lately her personality has become affected at times and she has had a hard time distinguishing between reality and dreams. She's living with my brother, but we're all (5 sons) concerned and want her to get the best medical treatment possible. Someone advised us to have her seen by a geriatric doctor, while another has advised that she be examined by a Neurologist. Our obvious concerns are Dementia, Alzheimer's, etc. or whether these symptoms could be related to her high amount of narcotic medications. Any advice, feedback, etc. would be greatly appreciated...Thanks","Do you have Power of Attorney? Like Sherry said, I think an appointment with the family dr is the first step.


 If you are not sure which doctor to start with, perhaps the family dr should be the first stop. He or she might be able to help you. But for some of the elderly, yes narcotics can cause memory and reality issues. My Gma did horribly on Vicodin. Her confusion increased dramatically but she didn't have much choice because she had to take it due to a broken hip.


 You might want to check the web site called Drugs.com. It will tell you all about the medications she is taking and side effects, too. Here is a link about Lunesta from Drugs.com. I picked that since you said her confusion gets worse after her nighttime regimen. This also says that antidepressants and narcotics can interact with Lunesta. It could be this combination of drugs. You might also want to check with your doctor or pharmacist. The pharmacist might know and it won't cost you a cent for the info. http://www.drugs.com/lunesta.html Sherrine"
Feedback for mobile app for Alzheimer patients,"Hello all, I hope you all had a great Christmas! I am a student studying computing science in Scotland, for my Honours project I am to develop a mobile application which will allow a Dementia patient to walk outdoors to locations independently without carers escorting them. I have a lot of work ahead of me and I was hoping I could maybe get some advice before beginning the actual software development. Basically my idea in a nutshell is that the patient can enter and store locations and notes per location into the phone. When they want to walk to the location, they select it and press a button, which sets a timer to go off every say 20 minutes or so, the user can choose a duration themselves. Once the time runs out the user is alert ed on screen with information on where they are going and why, with further options. These options could be: to continue being outside which resets the timer to 0 and counts towards 20 minutes again, or press to get a map showing the route home from their current location or call a designated carer. The problem is due to the nature of Dementia it cannot be trusted that they will remember they have the device, so the only way I can think of is timed alert s, which I guess could be very annoying, but if suffering this nuisance can provide some freedom then it should be worth it right? I have never dealt with patients before, I have no idea how this type of application would work, but after 2 months of thinking non stop, I cannot see any other way a Dementia patient could utilize a mobile application designed to help them. I did think about tracking the users location at all times but this is too risky as the patient being very dependent on the technology may not have the best area which supports cellular data which maps need in order to track phones outdoors, also using maps a lot can use a lot of cellular data and could become expensive, which is why I moved on to my current idea. If anyone could provide me with any information or advice that would be greatly appreciated, the more information I have the better results I can hope to achieve from this project. I really would love for this to actually help these poor people. Many kind regards, Raymond","I love the idea of creating something for AD Patients. Sadly, as they progress it won't be able to be used, as they won't remember. I could see it working in the first states of AD though. Spinning off of Sherry's Idea, a Tracking Device with the AD Patient (like shoes, shirt, depends) and a mother locator for the caregiver would be nice. My Gma would seriously despite the door alarms escape, and we lived on a super busy road. Her house is so old it was heated wood stove, and had no smoke alarm. I kindly called upon the fire dept with the smoke alarm problem and they graciously came out putting one up, and a few weeks later... GMA decided to open the wood stove door and well, not close it. Alarm went off, as I was putting laundry away so I went to the living room, and smelled smoke in hallway. Door alarms too, she'd always set those off and wander.


 You're right, the device that you are thinking of is just not feasible. It's great that you want to create something for the AD patient but unfortunately they will not be able to utilize it. They already have something on the market that the AD patient wears and it has a GPS on it with a monthly monitoring service. However, it can be a bit costly after a while because you are paying a monthly fee. So if you can design something similar without a monthly monitoring service - perhaps something the caregiver can use, that would be something more people would be interested in I imagine."
Advice needed,"Hello, I am having some concerns about my MIL and i dont know too much about alzheimers disease and i would like opinions on if you think i need to have her checked out or not. She is 71 yrs old. She has always been somewhat forgetful and temperamental but to me she seems to be getting worse. I have discussed this with my husband but he does not seem concerned about it. She repeats herself all the time and when we try to explain something to her it takes forever to get her to understand and most times i dont think she really understands it. Example.. she bought a television and it is supposed to be delivered. She has forgotten that she ordered it and it was only a couple of days ago she asked 3 times the other night if she ordered it or not. if her computer is not working the way she thinks it should she throws a fit like a 3 yr old and i mean literally she screams pounds tables and stomps around. she gets mad and upset very easily. she doesnt drive anymore because her car broke down and it has been a yr since she has driven but when she did drive she got lost in her own neighborhood twice and she has lived her over 30 yrs. sometimes she seems fine other times not. I know there is no way we will get her to the dr to be examined and she would be very mad if we told her we thought she might have this so i dont know what to do. any advice anyone can give me is very much appreciated.","Thank you for your response, He does spend time with her because she lives with us however i am the one home all day with her but he sees how she is and how he has to explain things over and over again but he thinks its just normal aging. Ive seen it get worse through the yrs and notices it a couple of yrs ago but he just doesnt see what i do. He had a brother but his brother had a stroke and passed away a few yrs ago so it is mainly just him. All of his other aunts uncles and relatives live in another state. How do we get her to the Dr about this without telling her why she gets angry very easily and would be very angry if she knew why she was going. One other thing i forgot to mention, she does play games online on a sight called Pogo she does the puzzle games and although ive not watched her play them I assume she does well or she probably wouldnt keep playing. She doesnt like to be bothered by anyone most of the time except for us and sometimes not even us she is in her bedroom mostly all day and all night and her sleeping patterns are strang he. She is usually up all night and sleeps at different times during the day i dont think she ever gets a full 8 hours.


 I've recently learned that I had a small stroke and also suffer from small vessel disease, all which translates into memory loss. A few years ago I heard of a website called Lumosity which was designed by a neurologist (or neuropsychologist - I don't remember) to help people exercise their brains. Your MIL might really enjoy it while also benefitting from the memory help she will gain. The site recommends that you work the games & puzzles once a day (it takes about 5 to 10 minutes) and it keeps track of your progress. It also compares you to other people of your sex and age. The first day I tried it, I scored a 17 percentile, which means that 83 percent of women my age scored better than I. Within a couple of days I was up to 50 percent. It costs to join, but she can try it at no cost for a month. I highly recommend it to everyone, whether or not they have memory problems. Your biggest issue, however, is how to get her to the doctor, and I sympathize with you, as I had similar experience with my dad. Perhaps if you kept a journal of her behavior, memory problems, etc, for a couple of weeks and showed it to your husband. You're an angel for taking care of her - it's a huge and difficult responsibility. Good luck. Post Edited (PattyLatty) : 1/3/2013 7:50:33 AM (GMT-7)


 Smurfy, I'm not sure if it varies by state but you do not always need a Power of Attorney to talk with the dr. about the course of action for a family member. I had to do this with my father just recently...he developed stage 4 throat cancer but the doctors have been contacting me about his health needs and I don't have POA.


 Curious, It is a tough position you're in, but there may be more options than you realize. One thing to keep in mind is that there are many conditions, besides Alzheimer's, that could be causing your MIL's memory, and other, problems. Some of those cause may be treatable - it is POSSIBLE that there is something she can do/take that will help her. SO... if you can make it clear to her, and to her son, that the doctor may be able to help her, maybe even help her do better on her computer games!, the wellness exam you spoke of may not seem so scary. She really should be checked out to rule out lots of possibly treatable conditions. In some sense, I always found w/my mom when she had dementia, it always came down to trying to respect her, and her wishes, as much as possible. Letting her know we were doing things to make it better for her, not just imposing our will on her. Sometimes we had to enter into her world, rather than try to get her into ours. Speak in terms of what made sense to her. And often there are ways to accomodate a loved one's wishes that you might not think of at first. Maybe you could get a Nurse Practitioner or someone else to come out and do some assessment of you MIL at home. There are many memory tests you can get online and do at home. And along the lines of the Lumosity game, there are many natural therapies that have been found to be helpful with memory, and that are safe to try. Like vitamin B, coconut oil, curcumin, even just getting some exercise, taking a walk, has been shown to be very good for memory. Don't give up hope, goood luck!


 You need to get your husband to understand that his mother is changing. He may be in denial. But it does sound like she is having some memory issues....not necessarily Alzheimer's but perhaps a form of dementia. She really needs to see a doctor and be assessed and/or put on medication to help. But in order to do that, you are going to need the assistance of your husband. You can also contact her family doc (if she has one) and ask for guidance. You're in a rough spot because you are the ""in-law"" and there is only so much you can do. Does your husband spend any one on one time with his mother? If not, maybe he is just not seeing the other side of his mother. Is there anyone else in the family that you can talk to? Does your husband have any siblings?


 Perhaps you can tell her that she is going in for a wellness exam at the doctors but let the doctor know the real reason you are bringing her in. You can ask the dr. to be discreet in his assessment, perhaps discuss this with him/her beforehand.


 A wellness appointment sounds like the proper course of action. However, The doctor can't talk with you if you do not have Power of Attorney. You can send a message to your Mother's Primary Doctor saying you are her daughter, and you live with her so you see her daily behavior and suspect a form of dementia and would like her evaluated. Whether or not the doctor acts on it, is a different thing if you don't have the Power of Attorney.


 That is good to know Sherry. In Oregon you need Power of Attorney. With Gma we couldn't do anything about it at first, we had to declare her unfit to get the power of attorney. The lawyer had to observe her to make sure she really was unfit. The doctor wouldn't listen to us until we had the Power of Attorney."
Brooke Shield's mom's passing,I know this was weeks ago but I wondered what she died of specifically? All the news article I read said complications from Dementia but what exactly is that? It was just a few years ago that she was in the news for having lunch with a friend who worked for the National enquirer that angered Brooke Shields. My mom got dementia a little later than her so I'm worried now. How was it that she was healthy enough to get up and go and then fast forward a few years and she's ill and dead?, 
leaving home abruptly,"My 84 year old brother was visiting me for an indefinite long term stay. Everything was going along great and he had settled in. One day he started taking belongings inside the home to his car, and bringing in other things. This past Sunday, I'd gone outdoors at 1:00 PM with my dog trainer. A friend who brings her dog to my home arrived at 1:10 PM, came in the door and introduced herself. She immediately came out to the back yard. At 1:30 PM I came in to invite brother to come out and watch the dogs train. He wasn't in the house and I looked out and noticed his car was missing. I thought he had gone shopping and didn't think too much about it. However, several things that he had brought were missing. Within the time frame of 20 minutes, he had packed everything and left the house without a word. He finally made it to his home (6 hours away) the next afternoon. I don't know why it took that long before he arrived. His son asked him where he had been and he didn't remember. Does this sound as though he has Alzheimer's?","Not necessarily Alzheimer's but it might be wise to have your brother checked out by a doctor, especially if he doesn't know where he was during that time. Memory lapses such as that is not normal."
New to this topic and desperate for advice,"Hello, I am new to this topic but not to the forum. I have been buzzing around a bit and finally decided to land and see what happens. My husband and I are currently living with his father who has the beginnig stages of Alzheimers or so we were told. I have some understanding of what this disease is and what it can cause. My father in law started out with problems trying to explain things to people but couldn't find the words, has trouble remembering the month,year his own phone number. He is still able to take care of himself as far as toileting, showering and some other things. My husband and I have both noticed that he is getting angry over little things and doesn't always use his best judgement. My husband and I do not know how to approach this issue with him. He is cranky the majority of each day and we do our best to help when he can't figure something out. my husband and I are very concernd with him being so short. I need all the advice I can get, I have no Idea what to do or how to do it. He does have a Dr's appointment on the 16th but he will not tell his Dr about this. He trys to avoid telling his Dr alot of things. Usually it's my husband that does. This is diffrent we don't want to upset him. So I would apprichiate any advice given, thank you!","There should not be any problem with your husband speaking privately with the doctor. It might even be while his father is taking a memory evaluation, or a nurse is getting some data like weight and blood pressure and a blood sample. There are of course meds and natural therapies that can be taken for depression (the anger/frustration with losing memory) as well as for memory support. Good luck!


 Welcome Lisa Dealing with a parent with a diminshed memory is very trying. Your husband needs to call the doctor and speak to him and then have his father evaluated and then go from there. You keep us updated on how your father-in-law is doing. Betsey


 There may not be a way around upsetting him and your husband needs to tell the doctor what has been happening. Perhaps the doctor can figure out the cause of these memory lapses and mood changes - whether it is indeed Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. He than can be placed on medications to slow the progression and/or mood stabilizers.


 Welcome to Healing Well, Lisa. Your best bet is a medical professional to evaluate him. Memory lapses can be dementia or Alzheimer's, even just plain old age, caused by a disease, a side effect of a medication, so much. Your husband can call the doctor, privately, like outside of the house and clue them on what is going on without your father hearing it, so it wouldn't be as upsetting."
I need advice for MOM,"My Father just passed 3 weeks ago. Since his passing me, my sister, and other family members have been staying with my 83 yr old Mother around the clock. The first 3 days of my stay I noticed stange things my Mother would do and I brought this to the attention of other family members. We had her checked for Alzhiemers and the diagnosis was mild to moderate. She has started medication but the doctor said the trauma of losing her husband of 54 yrs. may cause it to worsen quicker or meds may not help. Our dilema is we all have jobs, young children, and some of us do not live in the same town. This puts the responsibility on just a few family members because Mom can't be left alone for lnog periods of time. We have talked about a nursing home, but it is very hard since Dad just passed. We are afraid this may make things for her even worse. There is no money for home care or anything else and we seem to be at a dead end. I would appreciate any advice anyone may have. Thanks, Beetle","My condolances to you and your family. For your mother, not only like Sherry mentioned you can do government funding for adult day care, there are also other routes, put an add in craigslist for some college students, free room and board in exchange for watching her (please do background checks if this is an option). Check with DHS, they have programs at no cost for at home nursing. I got 30 hours a month based on my income. If a nursing home, please do not make appointments, just show up and do a tour, talk to the residents. I worked at a very bad one and refuse to put my family in it.


 I'm sorry about the loss of your father. My condolances to you and your family. As for your mother, have you checked out to see if your state offers government funding adult daycare? She may be able to get assistance from the state if she qualifies. Check out www.alz.org. You might be able to find some information on this site including where to find assistance."
New phase of Alzheimers?,Lately my FIL hasn't wanted to get out of the bed and he has been lathargic so we thought he was just having a bad few days. But today he didn't want to eat but was alert and knew where he was which is a FIRST he has thought he was in the hospital for a month of being here. But he is still just very sleepy. I feel so bad for him. He seems so withdrawn and so sad? Does it get better? He had a stroke and Aspiration pnemonia already so that set him back but everyday is so back and forth! HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"this Forum has been AWESOME I so appreciate everyones stories. I feel like I am not the only one going through this! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


 Did you read my response to you on your other thread? I'm sorry you have to witness this and I totally understand the helplessness you feel. I wished I could say this will get better but there is no magic crystal ball. Hang in there!


 You're welcome :) but no, you definitely are not alone! I had my Gma live with for 5 years before placing her in a home. It was not easy and this forum was my godsend back then."
Good morning everyone,"I need some help as to where to start here. Ok here is what going on, my mother in law was diagnosed in 2005 and was doing quite well in the beginning. However we are now at that point where she needs more care then any of us can handle. She has long term ins however it does not cover the first 100 days and will only pay for four years. I'm trying to get her onto Medicare but I need some help there too cause I don't think they are going to take her.", 
TV series' solution to parents with Alzheimer's,"I watched an episode of Desperate Housewives that was shown 2 weeks ago. Tom's mother came to visit and helped take care of the newest grandchild and also just to help out in general. The problem was mom got her kids' names confused which made Nanette suspect she could have Alzheimer's. Tom didn't believe her and told her to leave it alone until he witnessed an incident from his mom where she slapped Nanette after getting confused and didn't know where she was. So what was the solution? They sent mom to assisted living. Mom was pleading with Tom that she didn't want or need to go. Tom told her all the siblings agreed that it was for the best because she can't live alone anymore. This is what bothered me: 1. Mom should have a long way to go before she can't take care of her everyday needs. 2. She has multiple children who should be taking turns caring for her or even just one. As mom was leaving she told Tom ""Tommy, remember when you were at summer camp and you didn't want to be there? I told you that you could come home anytime if you want to."" I cried my eyes out watching this part. So Tom got sad for about 2 minutes of the end of the episode. He was back to normal in the next week's show. What kind of world do we live in where parents are tossed aside to strangers to take care of because we lead selfish lives and does not want or care to make sacrifices to ensure the safety and security of our parents? Who would have their best interest if not family members? I don't care how well workers do their job. There's always job stress and with the economy the way it is, people are taking out their frustration at work. Unfortunately in this case it's elderly people who can't defend themselves instead of co-workers that are equal in mental capacity as them. My grandmother used to always say the one who goes first is the luckiest. My grandfather died before her and she was tossed around between 8 kids until no one wanted her and she was sent to a home where she died there. PEOPLE need to wake up and realize everything comes around and what you do you will receive when it's your turn. I'm not attacking those that have sent their parents to a home. I'm sure most have tried their best and this was last resort. In Tom's case it was a quick fix. Thanks for letting me vent.","Thank you for getting my sentiments. You don't see people sending their children to orphanages like they send their parents away to nursing home. Being old sucks. You slave your whole life providing for your family and in the end you don't even get the respect you deserve for all the hard work.


 Well said. While I realize caregiving is A LOT of work, you have to think about the whole picture and think of the patient's side of things. What would you want if you were in that situation? I was just reading some interesting caregivier stories on this site....worth a visit: http://www.eldercarelink.com/Go/contest/main/CreatedOn/All/1


 I've read this string over and over, and seriously, my I don't consider myself to be the kind of person to toss my parents into an assisted living because I'm selfish. I hold down a job, a house, travel frequently, and try to take care of my parents by myself because my other siblings are hours away. I also have caregivers coming in to help, and I do their finances. What I believe is that my parents raised me to be self sufficient and do exactly what I'm doing -- I don't think they would want me to throw away my job, my family, my house just to take care of them. As a matter of fact, many of my colleagues are in the same conundrum that I am; how do we best take care of our aging parents? It's not something I take lightly and think about it constantly. Not only do I have parents here, but in-laws on the east coast who are having major issues. And please remember, our generation is probably the first generation to really have to deal with aging issues. Our parent's didn't really have that issue (some did) but I know my parent's both retired at 52, and their parents had died before their retirement. They didn't have to deal with aging parents. It's a tough thing to carry this load. I realize my parents raised me, but I think they know they are loved and cared for -- even if I need to rely on an assisted living facility.


 Agreed Pistol Pete. Everyone needs to make their own choices to make sure their family members are safe and cared for in the way that is right for them. And that's evident dealing with parent's on both coasts!


 Well, Bella, then you win the badge of honor. I cannot live up to your expectations. We all need to do what we need to do to take care of our parents and I am satisfied with how I am handling things.


 So on Brother's and Sisters Sally Field's character sends her mom to a home because her mom wanted to go. Then last week Grey's Anatomy Richard sends his wife to a home because she wanted to go. For once I would like to see the children do their best because shipping mommy or daddy off because they don't want to burden their kids and the kids are happy to comply. I just feel what these shows are doing is encouraging people to send away their parents. It was very sad to watch. I always see it as a last resort. Maybe for timing purposes on the shows it is assumed the children had done all they could before saying bye bye and we will visit you.... maybe.


 That's something that wouldn't happen with my mom. She's not social and would only withdrawal and wait for me to come and see her and then take her home. She was never the self sufficient type when she was normal so she always expected to be cared for by me. When I take her to the doctor and the doctor asks her questions she turns and looks at me to answer. She won't lift a finger. I'm the only sibling here so if I don't visit then no one will be there and that would mean I would have to do daily then she might as well live with me to save me the time and gas money.


 No one is saying you are a bad person if you do send them to a home. Just make sure it was the last resort and not a quick fix. Moky, you are awesome!


 It was about what the title said. How TV shows solved the problems of parents with Alzheimers. They all send them to a home then the discussion just went all over the place. Parents who cannot take care of themselves any longer would naturally need help. The discussion then became a questions of ""who will do it?""


 My family went through this 9 mos ago when my mom died...she was 87 and was caring for her 96 yr old sister who has alzheimers. My aunt ""M"" is been pretty clear of mind but would get confused and angry at times. My husband and I along with our then 17 yr old daughter had to move into my moms house to care for my aunt. Alot of changes...we had to move out of our home, move 80 miles away into a small 2 br home. My aunt and daughter gets the BRs and my husband and I sleep in the LR, he on the floor and me on a daybed. We try our best to care for my aunt who is now 97. She gets to be irritating constantly asking if the dogs have been fed. We tell her yes and in just a few minutes she will ask if her favorite dog has been fed. We have to tell her yes again. She dont want us to put the dogs out to potty, dont think they need to go out. She'll argue that she hasnt had anything to eat even though we gave her her food an hour ago. (She only eats twice a day but may have a snack). We would not put her in a home unless as a last resort. I promised my mom that we would make sure she was taken care of and even had to make my brother see that he wasnt capable of staying here day after day with her...he liked partying and his freedom. And just recently he passed away. It is hard taking care of her, she sits and watched TV all day, we try to get her interested in other things. She does go to listen to music two Sat. a month...and she even dances. She has made a name for herself in our town...and has had her picture in the paper several times. I have a hard time dealing sometimes but I do love her and until she gets to where she is bedridden and we cant care for her she will stay here where we can give her what she wants and needs. We have our own health problems and my husband lost his job a yr ago because of having to go on insulin (he was a truck driver) Someone has to be her all the time, we do have an aid that comes wjich helps alot. I am going to join ALZ support group in my area to help deal with the behaviors. Kathy


 Yes, it's a sad world where people feel that it's okay to ""throw away"" the elderly. My feeling is if it wasn't for the elderly, then YOU wouldn't be here today. We need to thank them, not discard them. In my case, putting my Gma in assisted living was the last resort and I was highly upset about it. But she was being verbally abusive to my daughter (who was only 12 at the time) in which it led to counseling sessions for my daughter. I had no choice really. But to do it as a FIRST resort??? Never!


 I just watched a TV movie with David Charvet called the ""perfect teacher' which referenced a woman who was caring for her mother while dating David Charvet's character. He asked her if her brother could help out and she said he won't that's just the way it is.. Bravo! I'm so glad this movie included that brief dialog to show the care giving role in our society today. It's always one sibling who does it all. I know nothing will change but at least it's recognized.


 In the same situation, what would you want though? For me, I don't necessarily want to burden my family with my care and would prefer to be cared for by professionals rather than my children having to bathe, feed, dress me. I wouldn't want to ruin their life by having to need their care. That's just me, and I know not everyone is the same, but when it's my time, i plan on researching well, finding the place where I want to live if I need to go into a nursing home and making my own decisions regarding it. But, yeah, I don't think i'd be comfortable being cared for by my children when they have young families, busy lives, jobs to go to, and then after a long day at work, they have to come home and wipe my bum? No, stick me in a home and come and visit me regularly, take me on outing regularly and enjoy me rather than be stuck with me.


 What's right for you and your family might not be right for me and mine. And what's ""right"" may not be what actually works. It's a tough decision, to put Mom in a facility or not, and whatever you think is best is what you should do. And you can't go back and see what would have happened if you had made a different choice. This is like a lot of life: Do whatever looks like it is the best you can do, and don't second guess yourself, and don't second guess others.


 Please let me jump in. No parents want to burden their children and will say so while they are still mentally stable enough to make this comment. However, once they are incapacitated and vulnerable, all they want then is to be with family. I see the terror in mom's eyes when I drop her off at the daycare center every morning on my way to work. That's just 5 hours a day and she goes home after that. I know everyone has their hands full with their jobs, husbands/wives/children and other responsibilities and everything is prioritized to what's most important. Let's be honest everyone, elderly parents are not on the top of the list for most people. I read any article recently where a woman's friend sent her mother to a nursing home and told her friend that her mother was happy and adjusting well. The friend went to visit the mother and got a different story. The mother told the friend that she was told by her daughter that her placement there was temporary and basically guilted her into staying because ""she wouldn't want to make her daughter's life anymore difficult than it already was"" The mom lost weight, spoke to no one and kept to herself. She felt abandoned by her loved ones and they rarely visited. My cousin is a doctor and she said she worked at a nursing home where most children do not visit. They get dumped there and it's out with the old and in with the new. Out of sight and out of mind. Again, I'm not saying people who send their parents to nursing homes are evil. We all try and do our best but please think of what kind of examples you are setting for your own children. They see grandma in a home then you know you will be in one too when you're old cause that's all they know. Of course if you see it as a happy pleasure house waiting for you to explore then you're fine. Who knows what happens in a nursing home once you drop your parents off. These are not family members that work there. They get a paycheck but they are not emotionally bonded with your parents like you are. They don't know how you always made sure your mom's hair is perfectly brushed and her nails trimmed and polished and she gets a change of clean underwear just because the weather was getting hot. There are too many people couped up there for them to care. Just remember your parents didn't send you away when you are small and acting up. They also had problems to deal with but they managed some how. If you can seriously live with sending them away to a place they will never leave from then that's all I ask. Me? I cannot. I always place my needs last. That's how my mom was so I got that from her.


 Hi Lonie, I completelly respect your decision. I'm sure you checked out the facilities and judged it to be the best place to have your parents live out the remainder of their live. I never trust anyone so it's probably an issue to deal with myself. It really sucks to be old.


 My Mom is adjusting really well now; my sister's and brother visit her every day and take her out to do things. She also has many grandchildren and even my cousins who stop in for a visit -- and she told me she is really happy. She has made some friends and she told me they are all in the same boat because nobody can remember anything. She has sad times where she misses my Father, but all in all, she is in the best place she can be. THe staff are kind and caring plus they keep her active and check on her all the time.


 I know everyone's circumstances are different, but I made a promise to my mother, she would never, if any way possible within my power, go to a nursing home. You only have one mother, she raised you, looked after you, fed you, dressed you, tried to give you all she could.........now it is her time to receive. My mother had cardiomyopathy, which was a death sentence, but with today's meds, she lived for years after her diagnosis. When her body could no longer tolerate the medicine, she lasted 3 months, weaker and weaker by the day- Parkinsons on top of that. I took care of her when she was unable to do a thing for herself, hospice helped. Do what you can, your mom does NOT want to go to a nursing home- I have never heard anything good to come of that. They die lonely and broken hearted. I'm sorry, but that is me. Moky


 Just for clarification, is this discussion about parents with Alzheimer's Disease or has it strayed off track and the discussion is now about elderly parents who can no longer live alone ? Thanks, Kitt


 Grey's Anatomy had the chief's wife get emergency surgery. He blamed the nursing home for neglect. They lectured him about not visiting her at all to even notice. In the end he decided to take her out of there and back home but this is TV after all and they want him to move on so she dies and on to next storyline. Meredith asks Derek to not place her in a home when the time comes. Yeah good luck with that one.


 You are a really special person to take care of an aunt like that. Most people wouldn't even do that for their own parents. I give her credit for being that age and still be so active. I wish my mom would speak more than jibberish and watch TV. She has no attention span and has her eyes closed about 18 hours a day. There is nothing of interest for her. Our needs are never met of course because we are caregivers and we take a back seat for everything. The guilt is what drives us to keep going. People always say what about you? Yeah well if I send my mom to a home and get to live my own life then I'll just have a breakdown from having a good time knowing my mom is being cared for by strangers and care is what I hope is happening and not abuse or neglect. I never married and will stay single forever. I hope my niece will care for me like you when the time comes because i will have no one. Funny how things turn out. Never in a million years would I ever envision this as my life."
Help what stage of Alzheimers is my FIL in?,"My FIL was diagnosed with AD around 2002 Around Christmas time my FIL was admitted to the hospital for 7 days for Aspiration phenomia, after his bought with that he was weak and could no longer walk well so my husband and I took him into our home to care for him until he could walk again. He was released on Christmas eve and 2 days after Christmas he WALKED (with assistance) to the bathroom. We were all so excited for him I took pictures and ALL. While in the bathroom which his normal visit to the restroom lasts 30 Min, every 5 min my husband checks on him and on the 4th visit he was leaning to the left almost touching the floor (we put in a handicap toilet so he would not fall out) but he was leaning over it? We took him into the ER to find out he had a stroke. Needless to say 2 steps forward 10 steps back. After that he now has to have soft foods and thickened liquids. He is completely incontinent and can NOT walk at all. My question is each day seems to be getting worse, Yes he has been taken out of his familiar surroundings, but he seems to stare through you SOMETIMES Kind of like it comes in phases. He wants to sleep all day and night, we switched up his meds so that the meds that make him sleepy we give him at night (namenda, Depakote) His newest thing is NOT WANT TO SWALLOW PILLS. He keeps them in his mouth or bring them to his teeth to pull it out of his mouth. But the main problem is he is just so sad. He doesnt know anybody but his wife to whom does NOT come around often? I have tried everything...We have teenagers and an 8 yr old living in the house and we were hoping he would cheer up. What I am asking is how do we know what stage he is in and what could be worse? I cant imagine it getting any worse than this for him. I feel helpless... Anybody know how to determine the stages? I saw the stages online but how do I determine what is Stroke related and what is AD related. We are just so sad for him Thank you","Usually AP is seen in the last stages of Alzheimer's. But it's hard to determine the other symptoms based on his stoke. Sadness, sleepiness and defiance are typical symptoms of AD. Have you talked to his doctor about his reluctance to take pills? Perhaps the doc can help you with alternatives."
A very wonderful day!!!,"Today was just such a wonderful day, I just had to share! ""Dad"" was getting bored, so hubby - wanting to give me a break - took him down to see our oldest daughter, her hubby, and her two boys. We were concerned that it may be too much for ""dad"", but thought it could be sooo good for him that we wanted to try. While they were gone, I took a 3 hour nap!! Woo Hoo!!! First nap in three weeks!! I also got to do some detoxing for my own body during the quiet time. Ahhh, attending to myself while I still heal from my own health issues. The trip was 2 hours each way, then they stayed for about 2 hours. Our daughter's boys - 3 and almost 1 years old - were ready to play with their Grandpa and Great Grandpa when they got there!! What joy they can bring to ""dad"" now a days. They also got to see our oldest son for about 1 hour today, then made the trip home again. ""Dad' was definitely tired - word finding issues, a bit confused - but happy (which is priceless at this point). He sat while I finished getting dinner ready, then readied himself for bed afterwards. He was in really good spirits -was a bit feisty even, cracking jokes at hubby expense!- and has plenty of clarity, even if he still had word finding issues and some confusion. We've had some great conversations with tonight, and he's looking forward to the 20 minute trip to see his sister tomorrow!! Gotta love this man!!! Nothing like everybody being happy campers!!","Thank you Sherry! So far this morning, ""Dad"" is worn out still, but he had an awesome night! Only got up three times and put himself back to bed each time!! Hubby and I really feel like all the things in our lives - even my having Lyme disease - has been leading up to this situation. Preparing us for this, and I have to say it's immensely gratifying knowing that whether or not this wonderful man understands or not, we are making a huge difference in his life.


 Aww that is so awesome to hear! Your FIL is so lucky to have you guys. Sad as it is, many people just throw their parents in home when they develop dementia. So it's refreshing to hear that there are people such as yourself that takes the time to help and care for your loved one :) Kudos to your hubby!"
Angry that my life is not mine.,"My mother in law moved in with us 10 years ago. I have been married about 12 years so most of my marriage she has lived with us. She originally moved in due to physical health issues. Without going into all of her medical history she has had 2 small strokes and now is suffering with dementia. My mother died 11 years ago so when she needed to move in with us there was no question. I was lucky that she had been a nanny and I could go back to work. I lost my Dad to Alzheimer's last year. Although he was in a dementia unit I was his only caretaker and he died very quickly when I had him placed. His downward spiral was so rapid even Hospice said they had not seen anything like his symptoms. ANYHOW...My mother in laws personality has changed so badly since the strokes that I don't trust her to be alone by herself or with my children. She has nothing except one life insurance policy and one on my husband. When we saw the changes we contacted social services and we were instructed to pre-pay for her funeral. It barely does that. Then we were told to transfer it to my husband which we did. She has been hospitalized so many times between falling, stomach issues, breaking bones etc. I came into my marriage with two kids and had two with this husband. My mother in law HATES one of my kids and he is 14. She told him his father left him because everyone hates him. I have to work and when I come home she has done nothing now but sleep and cause chaos. Unlike my father who could afford to have the best treatment she will end up on medicaid eventually. Her GP said it is unsafe for her to be alone and needs to be in a full care facility. We had her evaluated and the county nurse and social worker agree she needs to be placed. However we transferred this policy (which we were instructed to do by a different count where we used to live) and now she won't be eligible for another couple of months. She won't eat (when I am not here). I can barely look at her for the things she says to my kids now and I keep telling myself it is dementia. I work all day and come home to her laying here doing NOTHING and it drives me insane. She refuses to go to adult day care, refuses to sit with us and talk to anyone except my dogs. If anyone that does not live here comes in she retreats to her bedroom or outside. She will leave her diapers laying around her room until the dogs rip them up. She tells me she has nothing to live for because she hurts and it infuriates me. My parents would have LOVED to live, loved their grandchildren. I had the warmest wonderful mother. My mother in law has never been that way with either my husband or kids. I have tried, I have given, I just can't take anymore. My husband is done and the kids tell me when she dies they are not going to her funeral. I am exhausted and feel like I am on the brink of a nervous breakdown. I have never even had one day alone in my home in 10 years. I have four boys 2 with chronic medical conditions and I have fibromyalgia and CFD. I know there are other caregivers out there that must feel like I do. Thank you for listening <3","Gentle huggsss. I have far more health issues than you and your kids put together. I managed to take care of GMA til it was too late. I am glad you have been taking care of your mother -in - law. I also used to work in the nursing home - most frequeently the Alz unit. Do you fully understand what happens to people with Alz or dementia? They slowly lose their mind. They don't know to pick up spoiled diapers. It gets to the point where they forget how to walk, talk. On my Gma's good days she did exactly what you are going through, doesn't want to live with a dime. How would you feel you knew you were forgetting a lot but couldn't understand? I would on those days make it light and say ""don't worry grandma it's just your forgetters working overtime. It happens to all of us."" You need a break, because your at the end of the ropes. Perhaps set a schedule with your husband to rotate days who takes care of her. Can you enlist other family to help you out? Like brothers or sisters? Friends? Don't tell her its an adult day care. Ask her if she wants to come with you. take her to the day care and just go for a visit with her. Let her make friends, like you would as a child. If it works out, you can take her there Btw, they don't have full sound of mind. You need to get power of attorney to make medical decisions as she gets worse if you haven't already.


 We are here for you hon. You can talk it out all you want. The best thing is after awhile you will notice we all are like family. Do you have any friends that can help? You have to take care of yourself so you can take care of her. Can you and your husband rotate days on who takes care of her? I know how hard that was for you with your father. I used to work in the nursing home. If I knew about the time to come in one of my patients, I'd be there. I even came in on my days off so they knew, especially the ones with no visiting family, they had people that cared. You know it is a true hard thing to do, is to be there. I found it extremely hard, but I did it as I have a ""heart of gold"" as one of the patients would say. I, too, have fibromyalgia. There is a group on this site for that too here. I know the daily pain you go through, physically and emotionally. Can I ask where you are located? If you are near me, I will be glad to go over and give you a few hours of a break. I took care of my Grandmother (Gma) 24/7 with dementia. She had her rare good days, but mostly bad. When she would hallucinate it was extremely sad. Perhaps that is why I took some comfort in when she passed, just earlier this year. She would think we were a meat factory - of children. With body parts here or there. It was awful. Once in awhile, on a good day, she'd half realize something was wrong and couldn't figure it out. She'd wonder what is wrong with her and why she can't remember. I'd just make light of it by saying ""Its ok grandma. Its just your forgetters working overtime."" She'd always laugh then say ""Really?"" I would say ""Yes grandma, it happens to all of us, even me."" She'd then say ""I wonder why"" I'd say ""sometimes it just happens to the best of us. It can be from many things, not sleeping good, medications, headaches, needing a nap, so many things."" She would be happy with that. It sounds like she is in the beginning stages, but I am not a doctor. You can put her in obversation and have her watched for a few days, but that is really it. Have you called senior services saying you need respite? They have a program where you are the one needing the care. They will give you X ammount of hours off a month and you can use them when you need to.


 Dear Makinguscrazie, I can SO relate and I do feel your pain, and I am very concerned about you and the enormous stress you are under. My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 9 years ago and by the way, Alz is just a form of dementia. She became horribly depressed, which I learned is very common in dementia patients. Maybe that is why your MIL retreats and is so mean to your son? Depression and anxiety can cause people to lash out. I am not trying to excuse her behavior, just trying to help you. As you said, you tell yourself it's not her fault, she has dementia. I use to say the same thing, over and over and over again and yet, after a year of mom living here, I had to move her out, I became so very sick from what I went through emotionally watching her decline. Also my husband wasn't on board with her living here and I felt as if I was being torn. I know how some people feel about skilled care facilities and how bad some can be but there is so much information out there, you can make a knowledgeable choice and the best thing you can do is make yourself known there. I realize you work and have children to care for, but once she is placed, maybe your husband can get over there, even if only for 15 to 30 minutes. If the staff know family is involved, believe me, your family member will be taken care of. My mom has been in assisted living now for 3-1/2 years and between my sisters (2) and myself, someone is there every single day. What has kept her in assisted living and not in skilled care is that we are there. We put her clean clothes out for the next day. We put her nightgown on her bed. We make sure the staff has everything they need to help care for mom. My mom can undress and dress herself, but there is no way she could find her clothes, even though she has a small bedroom with a full bath, she simply doesn't know where her clothes are. In any case, just wanted you to know that yes, there are others like you out here that do understand. Miriam


 GRINS... Crazie, I fell down the flight of stairs (great for fibro) There is a form that has ""Mini strokes"" in dementia. Sherry can you help me on that? Crazie, take break! You need one.


 Thanks Sherry! I had forgotten the name of it, but that is the one my Gma had before she passed.


 I know that coming here to Healingwell feels good yes? To have an outlet to your frustrations? But rest assured, I COMPLETELY understand. It is NOT easy to care for someone with dementia. It takes a lot of patience that is for sure. But when someone has dementia, they are literally changed. Their whole personality is not the same. What you knew and what they are NOW can be confusing - it's also confusing for them. If a person is ""evil"" before dementia, dementia seems to magnify that persona. But if a person is gentle before, than they can be gentle after. Really tho it's so very individualistic depending on the person. Do not compare one ""mother"" or ""father"" to the next - it's like saying that all the colors of blue should be cobalt. Each person is there is own person and not one person has the same personality. So, please do not compare your MIL to your parents - that is not fair to your MIL. Sad as it is to say, it is what it is. Let me tell you my story with my grand mother: My gpa died and my Gma moved in with me, my husband and my two children. She was all there mentally but after a few months of living with us, we found out that she had bladder cancer. After surgery, chemo and radiation her mental status declined greatly. She HATED my daughter - who was only 9 at the time - and it made my daughter feel horrible (which unfortunately resulted in therapy later). But my gma LOVED my son, he could do no wrong. I also could do no wrong but she had an issue with my husband - who btw is a great, wonderful and caring man but she had it already in her mind who she loved and who she didn't. I also was dealing with some hefty health issues (see my signature) and I found it very hard to deal with her, her health issues and the conflict of everything it entailed. I only continued on because I loved her, she was the only family I had left on my mother's side of the family. But when she started opening doors at night, I knew that I just could not care for her anymore and with a heavy heart I had to put her an assisted living center. She passed away about 2 years after placing her. I know you are at the end of your rope. But perhaps you can afford to find at home care for her, while you are gone or whatnot until whatever it is that you are waiting for to become effective? But please do not take it out on her - she is not who she normally is. Doing NOTHING is part of the whole disease. Please look up dementia or Alzheimer's to educate yourself a bit more on what the symptoms are. Most times it's not because the person is lazy or anti-social - it's part of the disease unfortunately.


 Thanks for listening and yes I understand my own father died last OCTOBER of Alzheimers and I was his only caregiver until I was left no choice but to place him. I have seen every family member of mine die with some form of dementia including every grandparent, parents, aunt, uncle so I am more informed then most Doctors.I have seen what this does from beginning to end I guess I was just looking for support and am not so sure I have found it here,based on these responses.I saw what a bad facility was like and that is opening up pandoras box for me which I am not ready to discuss.I also have seen the polar opposite and know that there are people that love the residents and care for them fortunately I found that environment for my father. I also know that my father was a 250lb retired colonel,2 time vietnam soldier and mean as uncontrollable to the point we had to choose to medically sedate him for his own welfare and the others that were taking care of him.Yes I know what went on and I spent every minute with him.I also was holding his hand after he took his last breath My mother in law does not have Alzheimers and you have to understand when she was hospitalized every nurse raved about how nice she is and how with it she was. It is like she chooses when to be nasty so I am unsure that she truly has dementia. My husband is a only child from a single mother, so there is nobody else but us.We moved after my father passed away to a area I am completely new to. I did not tell her it is a adult daycare I told her it was to make new friends since we moved. BTW I have two kids out of four with severe health issues as well as about every diagnosis that these forums hold and have never disclosed my own health issues. I guess I just needed someone to hear me. With my kids I truly feel it is the most important thing to protect them even if that person is family. It isn't a huge mystery we are waiting for medicaid to kick in and based on two small life insurance policies we have to wait. We are like most middle class americans right now strapped and have one in college as well as three at home. I know the importance of family believe me to have all of my family gone except one sister that lives in another state.


 makinguscrazie, Please inform your 14 year old as hard as it is for him. I went through a similar situation with my grandmother. Hang in there. Life's lessons are not always fair. This is a hard one to swallow. keep your cool. These events will pass. Time will change your attitude. Best of luck to you.


 Thanks everyone. My life is nuts to say the least. In the last week I fell 13 feet off of a ladder (great for fibro) and actually knocked a kidney stone (which I didn't know I had and never had any experience with) into my eureter. I honestly thought I was going to die with that pain All the Dr's said they had never seen anything like it. I came home with suck a massive amount of pain killers that actually shocked to Dr's, waited for the kidney stone to pass and listened to her tell me she was dying from another stroke. An hour later she told me I was stupid and stomped to her room. I finally passed the stone between working, taking care of her, seeing the urologist, the orthopedist, the ER, and the kids. Then the fibro kicked in with the rain and then one of my dogs got critically ill because she fed her people food. $500 later she got nasty because I tried to talk to her about it. The dog had a accident in the house and she tried to clean it up and managed to mop it into a heating vent. Oh and did I manage to mention she is a SAINT BERNARD. If I could run away some days I would but with the planters fastiaitis even she could catch me. Even with the stroke she told me she was having each day of the week. Then the fibromyalgia then kicked in with the hormones of a 14 year old boy who told me he can't wait to move out when he is 16 because one of his friends told him that is the age that he can be emancipated. ARGHHHHHHH I wish I did have friends but honestly we moved because everything that I was around reminded me of my father and when I was able to get my inheritance I spent it all on a home and left my business in a town that I knew nobody. I wanted my boys to experience small town living but have found it hard to meet a lot of people other then the women I work with an hour away. Thanks for listening yet again just been a hard week but I am sure that those of you care taking understand.


 Omgoodness! You poor dear! You are just having a rough go all around aren't you?? Are you feeling any better now? Smurfy, it's called Vascular dementia.


 You certainly have a full plate. You can have the Office of Aging social services come to the house and evaluate her for services....caregiving, transportation to doctors etc. If that doesnt work then place her in a alzheimers unit in facility ASAP. She is on medicare right? County nursing homes take medicare at least in PA they do and when she qualifies for medicaid then the home will take that for payment. Betsey"
A quick introduction....,"Hi All, I can usually be found in the Lyme disease forum, due to my having several of the tick-borne infections, but my FIL just moved in with hubby and I a little over a week ago - Whew! Have we ever been busy! I didn't realize just how busy we would be taking care of this sweet man! Our children are all adults, and we even have 2 grandsons that bring their parents up for a visit from time to time as does our other daughter. We also have 2 boys, but they stay pretty busy with their own lives and don't visit much unfortunately. Today is our first Dr.'s appt with 'Dad', so I won't make this long as we have to leave soon, but I wanted to first of all say a hearty thank you(!!!) for the information that is available in the resource center for this forum! I've found lots of helpful tidbits!! We just found the type of music that he used to listen to with his wife, but hasn't been able to listen to (he forgot what he liked listening to) for a while now. Next, we are removing one of the mirrors in the bathroom. We still have boxes around, as we have yet to have the time to get his things unpacked - evidently he needed this kind of extensive care long before this - as he's been keeping us pretty busy trying to learn his routines, habits and get used to the pacing and other issues. I really am looking forward to joining in on the conversations here about dementia and all that it holds! Oh, we aren't even sure what type of dementia 'Dad' has yet. Hopefully things will get underway today so that we can get him diagnosed properly and medicated if needed. Thanks again!","Thank you so much for the welcome, Sherry! I've been reading many of the past threads for info already! Yes, the transition has gone fine, although it's been quite stressful for 'Dad' and so we've had a lot of getting up at night, and increased issues. The good news is that the new doc's appt went so very well!! He's on Warfarin and fell about 3 or 4 weeks ago and so he's off to have x-rays on his shoulder (which has been quite painful for him) and a cat scan for his noggin to be sure no damage happened. My hubby is on Warfarin as well, so we are well acquainted with the dangers. Once the immediate is taken care of, we will concentrate more on what medications he should be on to help with the other health issues he has. The doc isn't too concerned with what type of dementia 'Dad' has, as she feels he is so far along with it that it doesn't matter much. I still would like to know which type of dementia he has not only for a better understanding of what we are dealing with, but also so that his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. He was in such good spirits this morning - even after a rough night - that although he has trouble realizing that I've been in the family for 13 years, he told me he was very grateful and proud to have me ""associated"" (LOL!) with the family!!! I so love this man!!! He's treated me like his daughter for the last 13 years, so I'm completed dedicated to this man as I my dad passed when I was just 17 years old. I look forward to being on this forum, learning what I can and sharing and being supportive of the others! Thanks for being here!


 Thanks to the info in the Alz. Resources area - I've already been reading about the different types of dementia and I happen to believe that he has mixed dementia -although I'm no doctor!! He was on Aricept, but there was absolutely no improvements, so it was just discontinued. This is a large part of the reason we are so thankful that he is now living with us, as we can now take him to a Nurse-Practitioner who is very respectful of him and makes sure he retains his dignity. So we will wait to see how things turn out with the X-ray and CAT scan and proceed from there. We are hoping to work through all kinds of things one step at a time, so as to not upset or stress 'Dad'. Thank you so much for the info!


 I'm sorry - late night with 'Dad' - your 101? Did you mean the ""Alz. resources""?? LOL!! You bet I did!!


 Ahhh!! Yes!! I have gone through all that was there before I even did my introduction!! LOL! We have a similar thread on the Lyme forum, so I looked for one here!! Thank you so much for making sure I had seen it though - a ton of really great information in there!


 Welcome to our little forum :) Don't hesitate to post any questions or concerns you may have. It sounds like the transition is going smoothly so far?


 The two main forms of dementia is Alzheimer's and Vascular dementia. Look these up online and maybe it will help you understand a bit more about the differences of these two. They are pretty similar though. Is he on any med for his dementia?


 Please read our 101... sorry I just couldn't resist Traveler LOL


 Psst I meant the Alz Resources at the top post in the forum.. I was thinking fibro forum when I typed that somehow.. its like called Fibro101"
More complications,"My wife, Wells, 79 years old and I guess in what I would call early late stage. I posted before about her swallowing problems. After she was tested yesterday AM the therapist recommended small moist food, 1/2 teaspoon at a time and to put fork down on table between bites. Yesterday afternoon her MDs nurse called with result of lab tests. ""Very low red cells, bone marrow not producing red cells."" Wants Wells to see a blood specialist. I said why, for what reason? Wells is skin and bones and to subject her to more tests does not sound right to me. Probably would want a bone marrow. How can doing that improve her situation? I have asked her doctor to call me so we can discuss the situation. Hank","Hank, I've had many conversations about this with some of my friends around work that are dealing with the same issues. I've finally come to the conclusion that the medical field has the job of saving lives, no matter what. I've had to separate my thinking about this issue. I know that my parents only wanted quality of life, and the same with my husband's parents. So, even though I lost my Dad to cancer, keeping him comfortable was more important than anything. The docs at that time wanted to do many tests as well...we said enough. My Mom, same thing. She is so tiny (82 pounds) that she couldn't do anymore tests, and she won't go to the doctor anymore. I guess it all comes down to what your wife expressed to you when she was in a more cognitive state of mind. Would she want more tests? If so, then go for it. If not, that's okay too. What I keep telling myself and my friends...you do your best to make the proper decisions -- not that it isn't tough! I would have kept my parents around forever, but I took their needs into consideration. It's heartbreaking, I know. Take care, and keep us updated on you and Wells."
"Well, things are smoothing out some!!!","I just wanted to do a little update, as things are *overall* smoothing out some!! Woo hoo!!! 'Dad' now has an electric bed in, bedside commode, he now wears disposable boxer shorts (YEA!!!), and we are getting good with his meals - he enjoys them even though everything has to go through a blender! LOL! Home health nurses have been by and we are getting set up for occupational therapy and hubby and I will be taught how to deal with each stage of the physical decline - how to turn him safely without injuring anyone and things like that! The Nurse-Practitioner that he now sees has done some basic blood work and that has come back good, and he had an Xray of his shoulder and a CT scan of his head because he took a fall and was never taken to the doc to be checked out, and they came back as good - although we now know that he had moderate arthritis at least in his shoulder. At least now we can ask the NP for pain meds that will help with his pain! Although yesterday was a hard day - he was being difficult and hubby got a bit short which sent him into hallucinations and confusion about being back where he was and getting bullied into doing everything. Fortunately I was here to 'run interference' and we got through the day with only hubby being incredibly sad over the ""loss"" of the man he knew as his Father. Today 'Dad' is a happy, compliant man!! Thanks for being here! Even just typing this out here on the forum is a form of release and coping for me!!","Thank you so much, Sherry!! Yes, we do know about him reverting, but coming face to face with it yesterday was a bit harder than I think my hubby was prepared for. I had to live through some really scary loss of cognitive function with the Lyme infection that I had - complete with a full paranoia period of about a week long, not knowing where I was, how to do many things, loss of both short and long term memory, not being able to use the English language much and so on, so I do have some idea of what poor 'Dad' is going through. Fortunately it's not the same, as I've healed and of course we know that he won't. It does, however give me the ability to talk to him in ways that he understands! At least I didn't go through all of that in vain! I did discover that being here for hubby is sometimes harder than being there for my FIL! At least I can ease things for my FIL!


 Thank you so very much, SmurfyShadow!! Yes, I do believe that I will be doing a lot of typing!! LOL! 'Dad' is having a tough time today - lots of confusion. Poor guy.


 Thank you so very much, Lonie!! Wow, you are in a tough position. My heart goes out to you. I know that it's easier on me than it is on my hubby, since it's not my own Dad, and it breaks my heart to watch sometimes. On the other hand, I know that we are giving 'Dad' the best care he could possibly get. I'm glad to know that the confusion of where they are is common, as Dad is dealing with this a lot right now. Poor guy, he was sooo confused two days ago as to how his bedroom got attached to our house, but at least he now recognizes and really likes his room!!! I do still get pretty nervous when hubby has to leave for several hours to go to his own doc's appt's though. I'm always concerned that Dad will want/need to see hubby bad enough that I won't be able to calm him. Hopefully I can get past this soon too. A whole bunch of adjustments for everyone! I have confidence in us though, all of us, as the love that's there for each of us is very strong and I feel that we should be able to work through most anything!


 Than type away! :) You are going to face many challenges with your FIL and we will be here for you. Try to reassure your hubby that the man he knew is still there, maybe a bit buried, but there nonetheless. Yes he will get confused, obstinate, angry, lost, scared and just imagine how hard that must be for your FIL. Knowing that things are not right but unable to figure out why. People with dementia or AD revert back to being a child more or less. Yes even children can try our patience, but it seems more difficult when it's a parent. Hang in there!


 Yes, I had a feeling it would hit you hard Traveler. HUGGGSSS Keep on typing hon! Remember you can email me anytime :)


 It's a tough thing Traveler, and I'm so glad that you are here! My Mom is as sweet as anything, and to lose her is so hard. She still makes me laugh; to her, I now live in the mountains(?) and she always wants to know how the weather is up there. Even though a live in the suburbs, I tell her how the weather is. ;-) Some days she's totally confused, other days she is semi-okay. I think it depends on how much stimulation she's had during the day and how tired she is. I lost my Dad a little over a year ago, and it gets to me sometimes to think I don't have my Mom or Dad per se....but I love to see Mom and hug her and also talk to her. ""Dad"" living with you might be tough for awhile because any move is confusing for them -- I remember my Mom calling my sisters in the middle of the night not knowing where she was. Now she is pretty used to her surroundings. Take care, and kudos and hugs to you and your husband. Keep writing! ;-)"
Recently Dx with Early Dementia,"My 81 yr old father was recently Dx with Early Dementia, the dr placed him on 5 mg Aricept which he has been taking for about a week...Since taking this we have noticed he is much worse especially at night, he wakes my mother up, he is even Hallucinating .( and this all started only about 8 months ago...suddenly ...not over night. Before The Aricept and the Dx he was mildly forgetfull and would have to be directed to things in the house, He knows everyones name and he has no problem remembering where he is going when he drives ( which he does not do often) We are stopping the Aricept , and going to start him on Namenda . I am not sure the Hallucinations go along with the Dx , should we be looking at other Dx...?...all his blood work and Cat scan came back great. Thanks .","Hello Jeepgirl, Welcome to the forum. So sorry to hear about your father. Definately take his keys away and have him evaluated by his doctor for hallucinations. His driving skills can be tested at a freestanding medical building that tests ppl reactions to breaking, and the use of the accelerator. It is awful to watch a parent do unusual activities and possibly hurt himself and others or get lost by wandering. He use to take care of you and now you are the caregiver. Give him lots of loving, and guidance. Keep us posted on your family. Betsey"
Getting in the car,Does anyone know how to get someone in the car? My mom has PD with dementia and sometimes she just has brain freeze and does not know to step in with her left leg while facing front then sit down. Most of the time she will sit on the ledge which is the bottom of the car seat or she might face me and sit on the seat then I have to shift her sideways to face the front. My uncle gave me one of those swivel cushions that can acts like a turn table but because my mom slides in the car instead of stepping in she then is not on top of the gadget instead pushing it away from her. Any suggestions please?,"The trick is I need to get her in the car first. Also trash bag = extreme heat in the summertime.


 BTW, I used this trick on my gma...her favorite was pecan pie lol. I had a hard time getting her to the car at times as well and this seemed to work.


 My gma would get confused as well. She was pretty passive so I didn't have much issue. But I would turn her around, help her bend at the waist and help her sit in the seat. I'm not sure how big your mom is but my gma was a very petite woman (4'8"" 85lbs) so I suppose that made it easier on me.


 Perhaps this video will help: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khTKRwoWqn4 It shows a safe method for helping someone get into a car, but suggests not to use the step-in-first method. I agree, that backing into the seat is best. And then you can help her with the leg lifting after she is seated. It will be easier that way. Make sure she can feel the car on the backs of her legs before she sits. This re-training can take a few times, so be patient. My FIL has begun to forget how to do certain things, too. Getting into the car isn't an issue yet, but he has forgotten how to buckle the seatbelt, so we have to do that for him. I assist my MIL into the car in much the same way as described in the video, and it works very well, although she doesn't need quite as much help as yet. Although she did have to re-learn how to get into the car after her stroke because she used to use the step-in-first method and after her stroke and amputation that didn't work so well anymore. Oddly enough my father taught me when I was very young that the step-in-first method was 'unlady-like' and that ladies should use the sit and turn method for modesty's sake. Funny, huh? I guess you could say my dad was kind of old-fashioned, but perhaps I'm better prepared for future problems should they occur in my own mobility.

 get a wheelchair van..... you can either put her in a wheel chair or have her walk up the ramp. I usually walked behind gma with my hands on her hips (in case she fell) then, I'd switch when we used the van.. I'd have the neighbor stand behind her while I got in, and took hold of her hands and said ""its ok gma i'm here and i wont let anything happen. just follow me."" I would walk backwards to to the seat turn around help her sit down and buckle her up.


 Well there is other services. Not sure where you are, but here in Oregon we can even get transportation for them. The driver takes on the well being responsibility. Also, perhaps maybe calling your worker and see if they can hire you an extra person to aid getting her in and out of the car. Maybe your current caregiver wouldnt even mind a little extra money. A wheel chair van also has seats in the back if you get the right kind. You don't have to put her in a wheel chair, she can sit in the seat. Also maybe getting one now will save you the trouble for when you actually need to have her in a wheel chair, as it is already there.


 Instead of a swivel cushion, you can try putting a large trash bag on the entire seat. This will allow her to swivel and slide no matter where she sits.


 To get her into the car, perhaps use a trick of sorts...say that you have a candy or snack that is her favorite, but she has to follow you to get it. Lay the garbage bag on the seat first, do not leave it in there (because of the heat), get her into the car, swivel her around and when she is safely buckled give her the treat or snack. Maybe this will work?


 Very cute but it's not that she doesn't want to get in but she doesn't know how.


 My mom weighs 125lb and is about 5'3"" She always wants to sit down anywhere so it's trying to make her stay up that's a challenge. Due to her PD she has trouble lifting her leg sometimes which is the problem getting in the car too.


 step in is easier on my back. When she sits and have me twist her I usually will hurt my back and risk breaking or spraining something of hers. My mom has trouble with measurement of distance. She tries to step in too far from the car and won't make it so I have to push her in within a split second or else she will fall to the ground.


 There is just me and my mom. I take her to a daycare before work and then I have a caregiver pick her up and stay with her until I get home from work. She can walk fine if that's all she does. She won't sit in a chair or sofa all the way back which then she leans forward little by little and then she falls and can't get up on her own. I tried the cushion before and it's useless for her because she doesn't sit in a car she slides in and the cushion gets shoved to the ground. She just freezes up sometimes and just won't get inside the car. Once she is inside she plays with all the buttons and even mess with the shift so I have to watch her and the road. She's not wheel chair material yet, thank god so no we don't have one. I wish I have a good neighbor to help out but that would be on a daily basis and no one is that helpful. haha Having PD restricts her movements and the dementia stops her from using common sense. The 2 combo is a deadly force. Mind and body disrupted.


 My mom has dementia and cannot be brought home from a driver at the center. She wouldn't know how to get inside the house and take her medication and go to bed. I would also be worried that the driver would take advantage of my mom since she wouldn't complain or even remember it afterwards. This is why I hired some one to watch her and pick her up first. Wheel chair van is not something I could drive nor is it necessary for my mom right now. I make her sound like she's 100 years old but she's only 74 and looks 60. The problem is she doesn't want to get inside. It's all about her willingness to cooperate. It would be nice to have family members always in the house to come out and help but I don't have anyone. You can't hire someone to just be there for that 30 second push every morning. It would be ideal though. Thanks for all your suggestions."
Do I still qualify for govt assistance?,My mom's best friend just got diagnosed with early AD and she has no income to speak of. I told her she should apply for govt assistance but she has a life insurance policy in her name that was purchased years ago for her kids. This means they are the benefactors when she goes. I tried to look this up online but got very confused as to whether this is considered an asset of hers? I thought if SHE is the benefactor of a policy then it's considered an asset. Am I wrong? Does having a policy mean her kids will not get a cent when she goes because the govt will basically get their money back when she passes?,"Why would you say that since the person receiving govt assistance is not the one getting the payout?


 This is what confused me from what I read online: A policy with more than a minimal amount of cash value (usually $1,500 or more depending on the state) must be liquidated with the proceeds spent down on care. A policy with no cash value does not need to be liquidated but the death benefit will be subject to Medicaid recovery efforts to return the amount of money spent on care. Many states will exempt a ""final expense"" policy if the full death benefit value is assigned to a funeral home. Assignment of a life insurance policy for less than its fair market value is a violation of asset transfer rules if done within the 60 month look back period. A policy owner has the legal right to convert a life insurance policy into a long term care benefit plan at its fair market value and extend their spend down period by covering cost of care while preserving a portion of the death benefit until exhausted.


 As a taxpayer, I certainly hope so.


 A life insurance policy is not considered income and therefore can not be included when applying for government assistance. It also can not be touched in the event of her death.


 Chiming in, I'm from the ostomy forum. I'm not definitely sure if life insurance is considered a 'countable asset.' From what I've just googled, it is. If it is, she wouldn't be illegible for Medicaid. Based on 'income', your allowed a certain percentage above the poverty level, depending on the number of members in the household, for example in my state it's approximately $39k for a family of 3. Other income, referred to as non-income, includes assets such as total $ in the bank, stocks, bonds, IRA's, insurance policies, gifts....this can not be more than $2000 in the state I live in. Not included is home, car, furnishings's. Depending on her age, in elder Medicaid cases, those non assets, a home, are in fact included and would need to be transferred. If she does want Medicaid, they would indeed make her 'spend down' this asset. Basically cash it out and she wouldn't be a Medicaid recipient at this time, she'd have to provide all receipts to her case worker showing payments for medical expenditures, and when all of it is gone, she is eligible. If there isn't any cash value, upon death, Medicaid will indeed recover this money, less the funeral expenses. My suggestion is calling several elder law attorneys that are Medicaid knowledgeable in asset planning. Some are more knowledgeable than others. Some host seminars, write books on elder care, those are the knowledgeable ones. Again, call several because you will get different answers every time, you'd be surprised. And if they don't know, ask them for a referral of an attorney that would. There are ways in providing health insurance to those in dire need without giving it ALL away to the government. Many attorney's will provide free consultations over the phone, some want you to come in and will provide a free in house consultation. This can become very time consuming. Be prepared. Also, you need to be very certain in obtaining a very experienced attorney, the wrong one will cost you in more ways than one. But not being insured, with a pre-existing AD condition, you will lose more in the end without proper medical assistance. Best of luck.........."
Keeping my father safe,"My father is in an ALZ facility for almost one year now. Recently a female patient has been following him around, walking with him, holding his hand, even kissing him. She tends to find a male patient and believes him to be her husband. My mother visits my father every day and tries to keep the female patient away from him. We do not want there to be any sexual misconduct because the male patient (my father) would be blamed. It is so hard to communicate to an ALZ patient what behaviors are appropriate and hard to get them to understand simple commands sometimes. What can my mother do or the facility do to distract the female patient from the male patients?","My grandfather has ALZ as well. But he lives in his house that he has for years with my grandmother taking care of him. If my grandfather had this happening to him I would definitely ask the staff to watch when she comes around or ask for him to move rooms.


 tinxabella said... This isn't my forum, but I tend to come on here occasionally because my grandfather had ALZ. And he was in a similar situation with a female ALZ patient at his care facility: she would even follow him into the bathroom. My mom asked the staff to keep an eye on my grandpa and make sure that the female patient didn't go near him in any inappropriate way. We also talked to the family of the female patient, so that they could address the staff about this issue as well. However, the staff at my grandpa's facility were often overworked and swamped with other stuff, so couldn't watch him all the time. We ended up requested that he be moved to a different floor where the female patient couldn't reach him, because the doors were ""safe locked"" so that patients couldn't wander the hospital. Perhaps moving to a diff room, or even a diff facility.


 Actually this is not uncommon. There are devices that can be put on the bed to determine if a person gets up during the night. They are pressure sensitive and can help alert the staff to wadering risks. There are also devices that can be worn by the person that set off alarms to alert staff if the person wanders beyond a certain point (usually beyond certain doors.) However, these items are more geared toward wandering risks and not really designed to deter people from fraternizing with each other. Basically, though, watchfullness and genlte redirection is what is required. I feel a certain amount of compassion for the lady in search of her husband, but of course I do understand the concern for your father and the effect this might have on your mother, as well.


 Wow, this is the first time I've read of such a thing on here! I know that when my gma was in the AL center, they kept a close eye on the male and female patients. And when a male started paying closer attention to a female, they would distract him and visa versa. Perhaps you should talk to the director of the facility and voice your concerns.


 Yes, alert the staff -- especially the administrator. My Mom has a gentleman that does that same type of thing but not to that extreme, but they watch very closely to make sure she is not bothered by him.


 This hasn't been discussed on this forum before, but it certainly does happen. I've often wondered about my mom, who has AZ, and invites ANYONE to come back to her room and share her bed! Actually, she is just lonely and wants company, at least that's what I prefer to believe. She asks me and my sisters all the time not to leave, to stay, and sleep with her. I just wonder if she invites the men on her floor??? I would hope that the staff keep a watchful eye. The problem is the door to their rooms does not lock, so anyone could walk in. Miriam


 I'd say you are a spammer. If you read it correctly, the woman following around the gentleman has Alzheimers herself, and believes the gentleman is her husband. The gentleman has a wife that is trying to keep a watchful eye out for him. Plus, your link goes right to your legal firm."
Is Telehealth a good option for my elderly parents,"My parents are in their late Eighties and live at home. My sister worries about them a lot as both she and I don't live nearby and their health is becoming increasingly fragile (my mum has the beginnings of Alzheimer’s). I believe you can get some kind of alarm systems set up to alert us if they have a fall or an accident through using telehealth. My sister and I would love to know more, particularly if there are any users out there who could give recommendations about the best equipment to buy and where from, what great new gadgets are available and where else we could get advice.","Hi Lonie - sorry not to come back sooner. I've not been back on this website recently. Thanks for your post. I'm based in the UK, but it's really good to hear about the systems you use 'across the pond'. That kind of emergency line is what we've been looking for and we've now had a chance to look round at some of the products available, although we're still not fully decided. We hope to get some of the equipment installed very soon, including buying one of those alarm necklace that you mention.


 I'm not sure where you are located, but I'm in the United States and had Lifeline Alarm system for my parents -- a wonderful and very helpful tool. You can have it set up to call an emergency line, then anyone else who needs to be contacted (it was me and my sister.) When my Mom went on Hospice, we had her necklace alarm changed to call Hospice, and then as time went on same with my Dad. It worked so well, and you can either push the button on the alarm box or on the necklace they give them. A person stays on the line the whole time until the emergency medical team shows up. It's great and I highly recommend it!"
Feeling Lack of Support from friends of Mom with Alzheimers,"I just need a little venting about just one in the many factors that make caregiving so challenging, and that is the feeling that I am being judged by my Mom's friends about my family's difficult choice to move her to assisted living and then now to sell her house so that she will have the necessary funds plus so she won't be strapped by additional costs of taxes and fix-ups... My Mom is in the later-moderate stage of Alz/dementia, and I crossed the country 1-1/2 years ago to be her caregiver. It really was the right time for her to move to assisted living, and we are lucky that it is a very nice facility. She had several peripheral friends that she saw only several times a year in her home town; as her disease progressed they made no extra attempts that might acknowledge they were aware of the additional issues coming up. Mom was always good at covering up; this is part of the disease. As she progressed she would attempt to see her friends less, and they, not being too close, did not see the day to day challenges that I did. When I got a chance to speak to them alone I tried to explain things the best I could but I always felt they did not want to listen or understand- maybe doing so forced them to think of their own aging, I don't know. Or maybe I was seen as talking behind her back about her rather than trying to relay to them that Mom has a worsening disease that affects her brain and behavior and all of her abilities. I'm aware that I don't need validation and that my siblings and I are making the right difficult choices, yet on the seldom times I've made attempts to join Mom's friends' gatherings to inform them how Mom's doing I'm met with a silence that I can only interpret as judgement, that perhaps they think Mom should have stayed in her house longer or that we sold her house too fast. Would it kill any one of them to acknowledge the heartache and hard work that caregiving entails? And why do I care? My Mom's choice of friends are so different than my own, and I guess I just need to be grateful that I choose support from those that understand this disease and the many layers of pain it can cause. Sometimes I wish the world just understood it better, rather than ran from it in fear. Someday...","Have you considered in home care? You can call the state and get in home care. If you got to move her, you got to. And you know the best thing about being judged - if people are judging they will be judged by the Lord. So they are just messing up their own life. Dont let it get to you.


 I totally understand. My Mom withdrew from her friends as well when the signs of dementia increased. My Dad helped hide it as well, and even though I stopped by constantly, and told everyone what was happening, people didn't want to believe it. Even siblings at one point -- it wasn't until they actually spent a day with her that they realized how bad it was getting. You have done the right thing by moving her to a facility where she is safe and cared for. As I told another friend who is dealing with the same thing, you just do the best you can for the safety of your parents. I believe that your Mom's friends are probably feeling a little afraid that dementia/Alzheimer's could happen to them as well and that probably is the reasoning behind their silence. And, many people don't understand health issues until they have to face them. I don't know either, but sometimes you just need a good vent!


 My mother went through the same also. I lived out of state and she always sounded fine. She was taking care of my grandmother. When my grandmother passed, my mother started rapidly declining. I had to fly home, sell her home and put her in assisted living. I wish that I would have known then, what I know now. To shorten it up a bit, and you are more than welcome to contact me, I'm not so sure that I made the right choices. The assisted living facility was wonderful. What I did not know, was that moving her from her environment was going to take a toll. I had to go and get her from assisted living because she gave up. She really didn't want to do anything. She had tried to feed her cat and visiting angels came to check on her and the cat had passed. I brought her home with me and after three days knew that I could not take care of her. She was 72. She went into a nursing home where I saw her every day. At first she was coherent. Then she went down fast. From the time time that I moved her into assisted living and the time that she passed was 12 months. I just wish that I would have known more so that I could have loved her longer. You have my heartfelt thoughts!"
Peripheral Neuropathy/CIDP,"Hi, I'm new on this board or rather in this ""chat"" environment. My husband is reaching his 4th year of Peripheral Neuropathy, which is not a disease that is mentioned in the Content section. It is a painful syndrome that affects the sheaths on the nerve endings, causing pain, numbness (yes all mixed up and complicated) burning sensation, and also a feeling of the feet are being stabbed with broken glass. I has progressed from the feet and is now just over his knees. Also in his hands which is not progressing thankgoodness as quickly as his feet and legs. Because it is the Pheriperal nerves in the sytem it also affects his balance. His diagnosis changed mid last year, to CIDP, Chronic Inflamatory Deyelyminating Polyneuropathy, which is a more aggressive neuorpathy. We have been in the hands of a Pain Management Centre attached to a hospital, so he has been on a lot of meciations and still is. He had needles inserted during a proceedure into his Ganglion Nerves which only eased pain for a couple of days. Next it was a Neurostimulator implanted in his gut and wired up his spine and a remote that he could activate himself according to his pain levels, it was quite a success for a few weeks, then an infection set in and everything had to be removed. Now we are with another new Neurologist who has diagnosed the CIDP, and confirmed his diagnosis with electrode conductivity tests. He has had one Polygam, and infusion of cleaned plasma that helps to stop his antibodies fighting each other. He is supposed to have had a 2nd infusion 6/7 weeks ago to follow up on his first treatment, this has not happened yet. To be effective it should have been done within a month of the first. This illness the same as any of yours has changed our lives, we cannot make any plans because good days and really bad days don't give us any notice. We are also tired of being on the trail of different specialists one after the other (and it's expensive) !!!!! However what can one do but keep trying to find, not a cure anymore but a treatment that will help. I wish the same for all of you. PS Peripheral Neuropathies can be the result/side-effect of Diabetes, Cancer Treatment, Lymes Disease,Heredartary, Guillane's Bar disease, exposure to Toxity, and many more that I can't come up with right now, my husbands is Idiopathic, which means cause unknown. Rolesey","Has anyone any knowledge about Thiamine (benfotiamine) and Methyl B-12 for peripheral neuropathy? I have been taking these capsules for 6-weeks or so, with increasing dosage per instructions, but have not seen much relief. This neuropathy is associated with diabetes, although my current diagnosis is ""pre-diabetic"" and my blood sugar is under control by medication.


 Hi Rolesy, Are u still hanging out here? I just read your first post over again. I have experienced everything that you wrote, plus some. about 2 months ago I was diagnosed with diabetes. No blood test ever showed it, this reading came from sugar in my urine, count was just under 500. I started meds for that and I decided to get off sleep meds,since the elavil that I take, along with gabapinten at night knocks me out pretty well. I also decided to get off effexor, since elavil is given for depression too. My doctor agreed, said it sounded fine to her. One that works for me regarding anxiety, ativan, totally relieves the feeling of a panic attack all my waking hours. Only .05 mg times 3 a day. My panic makes every bit of my pain worse too....I hope your Dad is better. That stimulator that was put in spine was a nightmare. Does he have ringing in his ears? mine just scream at me all day. I do have a great pain doctor,who shares with my other docs too. By the way, my mom just went to her new urinology doctor at U of Arizona med, school. He was so very concerned that she had been taking elavil and ativan at nite. He told her that givin together to a heart condition patient is a sure fire Heart Stopper, those were his words""heart stopper"". SCARY. My mom has neuropathy in her pelvic and colin and rectum. Bless her heart she has such pain. She has RA and along with she has Sjogrens syndrome. Her kidneys and other organs are so dry. She has no saliva at all, and no tears. I must go and call her. We email and talk all the time. Hope all is well with u, a caregivers job is a disease on its on. It drags one down terribly. She is a fighter tho, her mind better than mine!


 Welcome to Healingwell Rolesey. I'm sorry to hear that your husband is suffering. Even though we do not have a forum for this specifically, we do have a Chronic Pain forum that you might find interesting. You might even find someone on that forum that shares the same thing as your husband.


 I am sorry your father is just exactly like mine. Its amazing that you have written it down so perfectly. I have had it approx. 8 years. It has started in my hands, finger tips are terrible. I take 3500 mg. of gabapentin a day. Also, amitriptolene for sleep as well as pain. I have spasmotic dysphonia, (voice box), another symptom of neuropathy. My speaking is so bad I just feel even more enclosed from the world. I cannot think right. I cant get the words out. Its my memory is just horrible. It has taken me 15 minutes to write this. I have so much sympathy for your dad. How old is he? Im 61, but feel and look 81, my moms age. I take 5 meds for the neuropathy. Im sure that they are part of the reason for memory loss and speech difficulty. I had every test you can think of, to no avail. Since my symptoms are in my hands now I worry about pain starting in my head, the same neuropathy as feet. I will remember him, and of course you. Caretakers, which is what I used to do before this hit me. I know the exhaustion of that job. I thank goodness for this forum. I visit it several times a day when I can. Its helps so much.....with best regards..Cathy


 CORRECTION I made a mistake about my moms meds. Her doctor told her the elavil and ambian taken together is a mix for HEART STOPPING for anyone with heart problems. My mom had a quadruple bypass. She has left main disease. She never new she had heart problem until the heart attack. The meds that we all take can be as bad as the reason we take them. It is up to us as patients to research the affects of medication and how they might react when taken together. i just wanted to correct what I wrote.....Hope everyone can have a better week this week....Cathy"
What are the Implications of Dysphagia?,"I'm a young adult caring for my grandmother who has Alzheimers (stage 6). She has been living with me for 2.5 yrs, so even though there is always a new issue of the day, I have grown pretty comfortable with caregiving. Grandma doesn't talk a lot, but when she does, she is all smiley and sweet and her true personality usually comes through. I let her choose her breakfast (even though she always chooses eggs and toast) and she helps me peel vegetables when it's time to cook dinner. She names her stuffed animals and reads aloud from the book she wrote back when she was an English professor. You get the idea: she's really a doll, ten years after her Alzheimers diagnosis. Along the way, she became wheelchair bound, lost the use of her left arm, developed cataracts and some other eye conditions, grew increasingly hearing impaired, had a million UTIs and some midnight medical emergencies...all the usual stuff. But I still love having her around. A few months ago, I started thickening her water, but recently I realized that her hoarse voice, recurrent hiccuping, and the deep cough the pulmonologist wouldn't help me with are all signs of dysphagia. When I slowly and consistently asked her specific questions, she admitted to me that she feels food stuck in her throat and that her chest hurts when she eats. From her symptoms, I would say she has probably been in pain for months and just never said anything. Whenever she choked on her food, I thought it was the recurrent cough the pulmonologist dismissed, and I would feed her slower, smaller bites. But now that I realize it's dysphagia, that's not enough. We have to change her eating patterns. Now that I'm closely watching her expressions and gestures at mealtimes, it looks like even the mashed potatoes are causing her pain. Or maybe that's pain from food she has been inhaling in the past? She's always in pain at mealtime now. And from what I read, dysphagia is really a problem at late-stage Alzheimers, and it's a leading cause of death. Based on her overall state of health, I had previously thought that we would have at least another 5 years together (she always wanted to reach her 90s). And every time I feed her, I feel as though I am causing her pain nomatter how careful I am. She started coughing in middle of eating baby food! I am going to take her in to a speech therapist on Monday; I heard that they are the ones who deal with dysphagia. But tell me, how long can people go on with this condition? What can I do to help her reach 90?","Dysphagia can lead to aspiration pneumonia and sufferers with AD sometimes do not get the proper nutrition in which they ""waste"" away. It is such a hard thing to see your loved one deal with. Unfortunately, there is no crystal ball to let you know how long one can hang on with dysphagia. But it gets harder and harder for them to get the nutrients they need and to avoid AP. Here are some tips to help with eating: www.livestrong.com/article/105308-alzheimer-swallowing-strategies/ I applaud your effort for taking on the role of caregiver. I wished more younger adults would do this for their elderly. You must really love your grandmother :)"

Thank You God Bless You All",It's always tough to watch someone we love suffer and the heart ache does lessen over time but your love for her will never cease. Take comfort in knowing that deep down inside she knew you loved her and that she is whole again looking down on you in heaven. My condolences on your loss.
Emfinders - Keep track of your loved ones,I came across this while reading the Reader's Digest and thought it was a very nifty idea! So I thought I would share www.emfinders.com/how-it-works The initial price seems a bit costly but the $35 a month seems reasonable for peace of mind., 
Bexarotene Off-Label Use,"Found this on the web and like to share... Bexarotene Off-Label Use ""Hi All! I know you are all anxious for an update. DON'T worry.. I have no intentions of forgetting about you! Presently we are giving my mother 2 pills a day. Each pill as I mentioned above is 75mg. It has been 8 days since we increased her from 1 pill a day to 2 pills a day. Unfortunately myself and my children have been sick and because of my Mother's low immune system I haven't had her at my house this past week, until today. So I have had to rely on my Father's descript ions on how she is doing. So this past week there were a few things that made my Father and I a bit hopeful. One morning she made coffee without instruction (my father said the coffee was bad, but she made it), she also made scrambled eggs for herself without instruction. These are not things she does normally. She also called me on the phone- she had to ask my father for my phone # and she actually hung up after only 2 rings but I can't remember the last time she called me- so that peaked my interest. As I said, she is at my house now and about an hour ago I told her I was going out for dinner later on. Then just a few minutes ago she remembered that I had plans to go out tonight. All of these things are giving me some hope. At the start of this process I asked her to draw a picture of a clock with the hands at 10 past 11 o'clock (found this test on an AD website). She drew a circle and from the middle of the circle she drew out 12 lines. I guess her brain was telling her that there was 12 of something but she couldn't place the numbers. Last week I had her draw it again. She drew almost the same clock- but this time added something... she actually wrote the words""10 minutes past 11 o'clock"" inside the clock. To me it seemed like a bit of an improvement because she completed 2 parts- the circle and the time. Although it was wrong- she remembered a second step. Overall though, she is still very confused. Next week my Mother will be with me so I will be able to have a better descript ion of her status for you.""","Hi What's the update with your mother since May. I haven't seen any recent posts. My mother has Alzheimer's and it's urgent that I find out. I dearly hope all is well. Thanks, Socrandreas

 Yes, I too would like an update on how your mother is doing on the Bexarotene. Also, how did you find a doctor willing to provide it off label? I have not been able to find one yet in California for my mother. thanks for your help. Barbson"
Back at it again,"As you know (well at least Red) that Gma passed (mothers side) in March. Recently, I found out my Father's Parents (both of them) have dementia and need assistance. So now I'm back at it again, this time taking care of 2 people besides me in chemotherapy and having fibro. From what I have seen, I am assuming they are in the first stages. They know there names (usually), forget a lot of things, and have a couple bad days and couple good days",

nurse's aide held mother down while nurse took blood.,Talk to her Dr.let him ease your fears & explain this to you.....This should have been done at the start...OR you can look it up online........,"I have the same type veins,& have for years.When they start grabing an arm I say NO. Do it my way or I'm going home........They will get the anethesist up to do the job.They know what they are doing.....I flat got tired of being poked have a vein blow out so I put a stop to it.....I pray hubby can rescue me in the same manore when I can't speak for myself anymore......


 As a former nursing home employee and a current caretaker, my advice is to get them out of that facility right away. I suspect more things than that. They are not listening to you or the patient. There are different sized needles, including pediatric sized which is great for smaller veins. The thing with pediatric size in adults is that it takes longer to draw the blood. There is also things like a pic line they can do, a process of like having your iv in you for long periods that you can take blood from too. You just have to ""flush"" out the blood when your done and kept it clean. That way they don't get repeatedly poked. I have rolling and collapsing veins, and I'm a fainter. I've learned for me it is best to use a shot of lidacane (a drug that numbs) and butterfly needle in pediatric.


 When I get blood drawn at our clinic they use a butterfly needle,no pain but gets the job done....


 The coumadin does require blood tests, usually its only once every two weeks. But it does vary between patients. The patient will bruise easy, With them holding her down, can be considered abuse. They are away of her medication, they are aware of the side effects. With how your mother is acting, remove her from that facility and call protective services. You can call Department Of Human Services, and report it, also you can ask them to sign her/you up for programs for Respite. There are programs where you can have her living with you, and they will provide you help in her care. I'm currently signed up in one.


 Smurfy Shadow May I ask what kind of help you get for your mother? My brother and I are going to the nursing home today and talk to the director about how the nurse treated mother and the aide who offered to hold her down. Also, I would like to ask when mother wouldn't let them do the blood test after they stuck her a few times, why did they stop instead of forcing her against her will? My brother is her power of attorney, but I don't think he has agreed for them to force something on her that is hurting her. I don't think he has that right? I have read that the resident can refuse treatment and they have to respect that. Thank you, Wiggyann


 Red-34 I just talked to my brother and he sees nothing wrong in them holding mother down and giving her these painful blood tests. He said that she has to have them because of the coumadin. I told him I was not going to come back to the nursing home because I could not handle that. I have been sick all weekend over what happened Friday. I just could not stand seeing them hurt my mother so. Thank you for all of your help Wiggyann


 Hi Smurfy Shadow, Appreciate all of your help. Something has changed for mother. I heard from my daughter who went to the nursing home yesterday evening that the nursing home checked mother's leg and the blood clot was gone. So they put her on a different kind of pill and she will have to get blood tests less often and they now have a butterfly needle to use when she does have to have them. I have a friend who lives in New Zealand and she told me that they have a system there whereby the nurse will put a very fine needle into someone's arm and it's attached to a fine tube. The tube stays in the armso that next time the nurse needs to take blood, no needle is used, they just open a tiny valve and the blood flows out. Does that sound like the pic line you mentioned? I don't know if they do those in the nursing home, but I sure wish mother would have had one for all of the painful blood tests she has had to go through since last year around this time. I am glad that she will not have to get blood tests that often now. My brother is her Power of Attorney and probably her Power of Attorney for healthcare. I don't know if he is her guardian. The lady at the nursing home took care of making him her power of attorney, etc. when mother first went into the nursing home. I am going to save your post so I will have it to refer to. Thank you so mucy, Wiggyann


 Dear Lyn, Thank you for your compassion. I know my mother lived in fear of the blood tests and it is terrible to live in fear. I just contacted a retired cardiologist on allexperts.com who has answered questions for me before and is a really nice person. He mentioned that three to six months is the normal time period for being on coumadin after a blood clot. Mother has been on it almost a year now. I'm so thankful they have put her an another pill with no blood tests. Hope you are doing okay Lyn Wiggyann


 Hi Smurfy Shadow, Thanks very much for all of your help. It means a lot to me I had mentioned that mother was taken off coumadin and put on another medication and she won't have to get blood tests very often. Actually, I found out that she won't have to have blood tests at all, except for the thyroid medication she takes and only about four times a year. Wiggyann


 Thank you so much for your concern Smurfy. My brother is there every day and I go in around 5:15 to feed mother and put her on the commode and put her to bed. If I""m not there my daughter goes or my aunts go, mother 's two sisters. So, we really do watch out for her. Even the people who work at the nursing home have commented about it. A lot of the people there have no family left which is very sad. There are several volunteers that come in which is nice. And basically it is a nice nursing home. They have a shortage of aides but it is hard work and the pay is not much. Also, sometimes they have to double over if the aide reliving them can't make it in. So they have a big turnover in aides. But there are nurses on staff and others there who look after them and the people who work there are very caring. I did find out that the nursing home pays a company and they send a nurse in to do the residents bloodwork. I had thought it was a nurse from the nursing home who did mother's blood test. I still don't know why she only had one size needle and no finer needles or butterfly needles. Mother has alway had collapsible veins and needs a thin needle to keep from having to be stuck so many times. Thank you for your concern. It warms my heart


 Thank you, Lyn I'm relieved things worked out the way they did. I hope you are doing okay. I know you have a lot of health problems you have to deal with and yet you continue to bless others. The world needs more people like you Wiggyann


 I was at the nursing home today helping mother eat her dinner and before we left the dinner table a nurse stopped by and said she needed to get blood from her. Mother had a blood clot in her leg shortly after she entered the nursing home a year ago which was dissolved with medication. After that, the nursing home physician put her on coumadin and she has had to have blood tests once or twice a week ever since. I am at the nursing home a lot and the tops of mother's hands are always black and blue from having blood tests. Today, the nurse wheeled mother into a nearby hall and I stayed near the dining area. Eventually, the nurse wheeled her back and said, ""She wouldn't let me give her the blood test."" She also told me that mother's jacket had blood on it and I might want to wash it off with cold water before it set. So, I knew she had stuck her already. I was wheeling mother down to her room when the nurse passed me up and told a nurse's aide that my mother wouldn't let her take blood. I heard the nurse's aide say, I will hold her down for you. Something about this didn't sit well with me, but I stayed out in the hall while they pushed mother into her room. Then, I began to hear her crying and begging them to stop and after awhile I went in there and they had not finished and were taking a tube of blood out of the needle in her hand and in between sobs, mother said, ""I hate this,"" and then I said, ""I hate this too, and I don't understand why you have to have these blood tests all of the time!."" Mother has very thin veins and they collapse and a nurse told me when mother was in the hospital that she needed a thin needle when they took blood from her becaue because they always have to stick her more than several times before they finally get a vein. I mentioned to the nurse and she replied that they were all the same size and told me because mother was taking coumadin she had to have the blood tests. It just hasn't been a good day :-( Wiggyann


 My gma had the same issues. She wasn't on coumadin but she did have tiny veins. She had so many veins blow because the nurses couldn't get a needle or Iv line in. It was horrible to see them poking her so many times and of course it would hurt her. The blood tests are pretty much mandatory for people on blood thinners. It's for your mother's own health. I know it's hard and it can be hard for people with dementia to understand. But no, not all the needles are the same size. Talk to her doc and see if it's possible to have the nurses start using pediatric needles for the blood draw. It will be slower to get the blood but it might be easier on your mother's veins.


 Thanks SnowyLynne and Red_34 for all of your help. I'm glad you spoke when you had blood work done. I took mother to the doctor' once for a blood test and they sent a young man up from the lab to do it. He told us he hadn't been there but a few days and I told him I wanted someone who was very experienced to draw mother's blood because of the problems she had with her veins and he left and someone else came up and mother had an easy time that day. Yesterday I heard mother screaming and screaming from the hall where I was waiting until finally I went into the room and she was crying and begging them to stop. It upset me that someone was holding her down. If I happen to just touch mother's hand when she is in bed alseep, she will jump and hollar ""No, No!"" and I know she is thinking they are going to do another blood test. She has done that before too. Maybe the nurse isn't very profficient at what she does. Something doesn't seem right. Wiggyann


 Thanks Smurfy Shadow, You've really given me some things to think about . As a nurse who does blood tests all of the time, she should have known there were different size needles. Both she and the aide or nurse who held mother down both chastised me and said that because of the kind of medication mother was on (coumadin), she had to have these blood tests done and even though they hurt, she has to have them. about that time I wanted to hit both of them :-( Wiggyann


 Oh I have a feeling that this nurse knows about the different size needles but she was either too lazy to wait for the slower blood draw or just didn't care to explain. Something about that doesn't sound right. But do not let anyone intimidate you in the medical field...you are the voice for your mother and sometimes you have to speak up on her behalf. I can not tell you how many times I have had battles with some doctors and nurses over my Gma - I refused, absolutely refused to have anyone treat her like a second class citizen because of her mental status.


 oops aware** not away hah


 Wiggyann, I was POA for my Gma and yes I could put a stop to anything that someone was doing to my grandmother. I had the ultimate say....it's like if someone was holding YOU down and you said stop, they would have to stop. But your brother is now your mother's voice instead.


 Who has guardianship? If your mother has her own guardianship, call a lawyer and became her guardian. I do a program with my grandmother. I live with my grandmother, who has dementia and I take care of her. We're currently enrolled in Free Family CareGiver Respite. Its a program that allots a family who cares for a loved one so much money a year to hire someone with training (you can obtain a list from the caseworker) and they come to your house, and give you a break. They can also reimburse a certain ammount of funds for medical needs like wheelchairs, canes, walkers, ensure (the drink), handrailings. If I were you first is to get guardianship tell your mom it is to make the people to stop holding her down, because she doesn't like it. Then call the DHS, and ask to speak with a caseworker involving Family Caregiving for Elders or Disabled. After you have guardianship, you can even pull her out of the facility and move her into your home. Your brother needs a wake up call if you ask me. He's lucky he's not my brother because I hold my own, growing up with three brothers and I'd dish it out and flat out ask him how he would like to be held down against his will to get blood work. All you want to do is help your mother. If there is a pic line inserted, which is VERY common for elders to have, its One poke. Its like an iv that just stays in you, and you clean it out every time it is used.


 Am glad she wont need blood taken as she has been subjected too alot of pain n no doubt fear jmho lyn


 Yes, that sounds about right for a pic line. Small tubes with a very small fine needle. It stays in your arm, so they can do bloodwork whenever. Your brother needs to realize that holding a grown adult down for bloowork work is not right. Perhaps saying to him ""Hey I got question for you brother. How would you like if people held you down and stuck a needle in you every few days?"" When he says he would not like it say ""Well I don't think mom would like it either, and that is what is happening to her. In fact, if you think about it, you are letting them abuse her. Don't you love mom? There are other options they can do for her like a pic line which means one stick in her arm and the needle stays there with some tubes and they leave it in her arm for as long as they want or they can give her a shot of pain killer before doing the needle for blood work. I just want mom to be not hurting as bad cuz I love her.""


 Do me favor will you? I know this sounds nuts, but its for the better. Visit your mother every day. Make sure to keep an eye on her skin, any kind bruising etc. When I worked in the nursing home, I saw some patients being abused, but the state wouldnt believe the annoymous tips they got of abuse because of where the bruises were located and nurses lying on how they got there. Most of the patients being abused were held down too hard for things, like ""oh we had to be agressive to change their depends."" I don't buy that. Maybe you have your mom in a good nursing home, maybe not. Only thing you can do do is visit every dya, ant different times so she always has the best of care. Keep an eye out for any bruising, and ask her about things. I am probably just being protective, but its because I've seen too much


 Hey Wiggy How are you im glad yr mom is off that n on the thyroid med will just need tests quarterly it sounds like your family is keeping her surrounded with love and thats great i wish you all the best hugs lyn


 They can use a Butterfly needle on her so much easier on her & them...."
Is This AD??????,"Hi, I haven't posted in over 6 years, but I read this board often. My father is 90 and was diagnosed about 10 years ago with AD. He is on Namenda and Galantamine. But here is the thing...he is basically the same as he was 10 years ago. Even his doctor said he is holding steady and has lost no ground. He still lives alone (refuses to have any one live with him), he bathes, dresses, and feeds himself. He watches TV, reads, knows who his children are, etc. Yes, his short term memory is very impaired, but other than that, he is a typical 90 year old and can take care of himself. He does not drive and I go over to give him his meds twice a day, clean house, look after his animals, etc. Everyone who meets him cannot believe he has AD. When I asked the doctor how can it be that he has not lost any ground in 10 years, his response is ""Everyone is different."" I agree, but I have many friends who have family members with AD and within 3 to 5 years, they have passed away or are in a nursing home and can't recognize their own children, or feed themselves, etc. So I have 2 questions. Can this be AD but in my dad's case it is progressing very, very slowly? Is it normal for a 10 year AD patient to say things like, ""I feel great, I just can't remember anything."" He knows his memory is impaired. Usually after a few years most AD patients I have known, no longer realize they have a memory problem. Any feedback on this would be much appreciated. Thanks. Michele","Sherry and Kate, Thank you for your advice. It gives me hope that my dad may be one of the lucky ones that lives the rest of his life with mild AD. I feel very blessed and thankful that Dad can still live alone and is so happy. I have been taking care of him for 10 years and spent a lot of that time being angry and depressed about his situation. I found myself negative and irritable and I know now that my attitude greatly affected his quality of life. There were many days I actually dreaded going to his house because I knew things would not go well. He took his cue from me and I am ashamed to say, he picked up on my negative emotions and attitude and mimicked them. But in the past few years, my attitude has changed. I noticed if I was having a good day, he had a good day. So it finally dawned on me (after about 8 years!) that my actions, reactions and attitude determined what kind of a day he would have...good or bad. At first I had to ""force"" myself to be positive, patient, and calm, even though I felt overwhelmed and angry. But after many months of ""faking"" it, I realized that I was really enjoying my dad again! I no longer dread having to take care of him. I realized that he really still enjoys his life and that has been a very liberating for me. I now enjoy watching him read, or watching tv, or playing with his animals. He still lights up when my brother calls from out of state and they talk for a long time. I marvel that he still has such a sense of humor and is always joking around. His attitude has improved because I started being more positive, pleasant, and relaxed. Kate is right, environment can make a difference and so can the caregiver's attitude. I am so grateful that the good Lord helped me learn this lesson before it was too late. I know things may change at any time and that there may be difficult times ahead. But for right now, I am really enjoying my realtionship with my dad again and I am so thankful for that. Thanks for listening. Michele


 AD is a mystery. No one can tell why one person rapidly declines while another doesn't. I've heard of many stories where one person has mild AD for the remainder of their lives and others where they decline from stage 1 to the last stages in a matter of months. I would tend to think that his medication might be stalling his decline. Which is a good thing! But I can't say for sure if it is or not. I think it's awesome that he can still care for himself and that he is still in his own home. And that you also take care of him :)"
Father very demanding with frontal lobe dementia,Hi My dad has general dementia but is also affecting the front part of brain which is the personality and emotions. His personality has erred towards being rather critical and demanding and hard to please anyway but this behaviour has increased all the more since being placed in a nursing home (due to complications of an operation by the way) 3 years ago. he now no longer walks and sits all day in his room watching TV. He does not wish to leave the home for a trip out either but his feet slip off the footrest of a wheelchair anyway. He shouts and swears and is racist towards the carers and is really impatient and hates being looked after. he is demanding towards my mum who is now not well herself and she is always trying to placate him. he calls her several times a day and sometimes these calls are just to complain and moan about the carers. WE try to be caring and empathetic to him but he sometimes shouts at us if we dont do what he asks us to do. He sometimes wants me to go to the home just to pick someting up for him - he is 30 minutes drive away from me. The hardest thing is - how do you cope with a father than incessently complains and moans about being in a home/the carers/his life/ saying you are better off dead etc. He is not depressed and enjoys his food - which he always complains about - and looks nice enough. Basically it is hard being empathetic towards him and would like some help on dealing with him without being mean or uncaring. thanks. karen,"Does he take medication? I am so sorry you and your mother and family go through this. www.alz.gov has a wonderful store for people with dementia and alz. Even telephones that do not dial out. You got to remember that your father is basically going backwards in time. He has hallucinations. Eventually he becomes an infant trapped in an adult body. When he is mean, he probably is going through a hallucination. And depression actually comes in hand with dementia. Perhaps a med adjustment is in order.


 With my gma, we had to put her in a phsyc ward whilst she went med adjustments... perhaps you should do that, and find a med that will help. then bring him back home.


 Thanks a lot - tried that - he cant even get in a wheelchair anymore - cant keep his feet on the platform - i have no idea why i think it is he cannt rotate his hip joint much anymore - in any event he will not leave his room - only if it meant coming to my house - whcih he cant do anymore now for the that reason.


 hey thanks for your input in respect of my dad. x


 Yup it sure is! lol It's taken care of :)


 I really don't have much advice for you. I know it's hard to deal with someone who is difficult let alone one that has dementia that magnifies the issue. Does he take any medication? My gma was on Namenda and it helped with her emotional issues tremendously - she wasn't mean or anything like that, just really weepy all the time. If he is not on meds perhaps you or your mother can ask about one that can help stabilize his moods?


 Thanks for your replies etc. No he had tried a few different meds including Aricept which have had no effect - they said it coudl be that nothing will help his mood - to talk to him he seems normal - he is just very demanding (he has always been a bit hard to please anyway) but i cant remember my childhood really and what he was like then - but my parents argued a lot. He is not hallucinating as he is quite lucid - he has reduced people to tears due to his shouting and swearing at them when they are trying to do things for him e.g. his personal care etc - even myself or my mum if we dont do things quick enough/correctly etc... its no surpise the home want rid of him. he is not a good patient.


 Thanks. My dad is in a specialist home - has been for 2 years now.. there are no others around - and this home is well known for taking people with really difficult and challenging behaviour al issues. We are waiting for social services to see about another home posibly one for mental health people or something (I am in UK). He cant walk; has no motivation to do anything apart from watch TV and eat.. he cannot even keep his feel on a wheelchair footrest and his feet drag.. so cant take him anywhere.. i have tried as much as i can to encourage him.... Its like floging a dead horse with my dad. so we just dont bother now. he hates being in a home and constantly moans about the people being useless. he is not an easy character anyway before the dementia. very hard to please and have tried everything to make his life better.


 my mother is getting quite mean with every one i have to take care of her and the Alzheimers leaders said it is her frustration she cant do the things she use to be able to do and at times they have clarity and it saddens them to see their self as a child and they cant get their body to do what they want it to so they get frustrated and have loosed there words so for some reason bad mean heat full words they r ember some how i believe they want you to fell just as bad as they do and they cant articulate like they had so they say things that will hurt you and the care givers here it all the time however its new to you and we take it to heart that our loved one who was so kind to us and it makes us cry and fell bad and be frustrated trying to help and then they say bad remarks it makes you ashamed in public at first because you know you or who you put in charge would never hurt them but people around them on the out side word don't know whats going on so i find my self being so frustrated that some time it makes it worse .i have found if you just step away take a deep breath it will be better crying does help and r ember she or he is not the parent that raised you the love and your memories are still their and in a flash they may r ember something to brighten your day . Can you have him transported to your home for holidays it may help doing pleasant events or get a pop bottle fill it with little trinkets and corn tape the lid and help him shake it and see how many items he can find if you get the brain moving he may do a little better


 IS THIS SPAM!"
The Christmas Season....,"For our caregivers...remember that this is that special time of year where we spend it with friends and loved ones. But please don't forget our parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles or friends that are afflicted with Alzheimer's. Take some time to go visit with them if they're in a home or if they live with you, spend an extra day here or there with them. Some of them may not remember you, nor what the season is but know that deep down they can still feel the love that you can give them. Happy holidays!","I am also a firm believer that they are in there somewhere, perhaps a little lost but they are still human and still have emotions; so I KNOW that they must feel the love. I'm glad that your mother is doing well and is stabilized. That is great actually! And that you spend time to be with her. I'm sure she really does appreciate that you and your sisters come to visit her :)


 What a great reminder Sherry! My mom lives in assisted living. She was diagnosed 8 years ago and remains stable in moderate stage. We are so fortunate that she is doing so well (she continues on Namenda and Aricept and we feel that is the reason she is so stable). She has no short term memory whatsoever, but she knows who I am as well as my sisters and she loves when we spend time with her. As tough as it sometimes is, we make sure one of us is there each and every day, even if it is only for an hour, we are there. We also call her every day, usually twice a day. That too is a tough one, trying to find something to talk about , but she enjoys listening to whatever is happening in our lives. I wish my life was a little more exciting so I could share it with her, lol! I just ramble about anything and everything and she listens. What keeps me going is reminding myself that no matter what, as long as she is alive, she is ""in there""...no matter if she stops talking, eating, walking, she is IN THERE and I truly believe that she will know that we are there, whether she knows who we are or not, and that she is loved. The very best of holiday wishes to you, Miriam


 It's funny, I was just having a really tough day yesterday because I had the feeling that since my Mom has moved further away from me that she's forgotten me already. We had a phone conversation, and she seemed so far away, like she didn't remember me. I know that's not the case, and she won't remember me coming to see her, but it's more for me. My siblings didn't realize that she was so far along. It's tough, but for sure somewhere they remember...we just say Mom lives in the moment now. The best part is the memories I have of being with her and Dad."
Prevagen,"has any one heard of taken prevagen for memory loss?. some have said that they were healed of altzymers.... i bought some off the internet,,,,,,, caren",There is no cure for Alzheimer's. Memory loss is a symptom of Alzheimer's but simple memory loss from other sources CAN be reversed but there is no guarantee (it depends on the source). If there is any supplement that claims it can cure Alzheimer's run very quickly away. I didn't know what Prevagen was so I looked it up and unfortunately it got a lot of bad reviews - meaning that it didn't help them or that it won't be able to cross the blood/brain barrier and/or survive digestion. Here are the reviews found on Amazon: www.amazon.com/Prevagen-Apoaequorin-30-Count-Bottle/product-reviews/B000V9O04W/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1
Alzheimer's and my Mom,"My mother like her mother.....has azheimers disease. She took care of her mother herself until physically she could not anymore. She chose a nursing home within waliking distance to her own home and was there everyday. My mother protected and insured that her own mother was not mistreated or neglected like so many other patients. For this reason.....as a family, we have vowed to never put my mother in any type of facilty and take care of her ourselves with the nurses coming by periodically to assist. She lives with my father who is 83....in a home attached to my oldest brothers home.....two complete homes with an interior connection. Idon't know how to explain exactly what stage my mother is at in this disease.....some days are better than others......I can tell you that all of her hygene is our responsibility now and has been for quite sometime. I am my mothers only daughter.....I am here.....I am here for support I guess....I love my mother very much......and sometimes this is so hard....and all the time my heart is breaking.","Thank you for responding :) My mother has a bed sore problem on her behind. The nurses have perscribed several topical medications to be applied liberally which we are doing. Mom sleeps on her back ALWAYS....so we are also using aids to help her sleep on her side to relieve the pressure. Should antibiotics be perscribed? Mom wears depends and uses them so I am concerned about bacteria causing an infection. Good to know you are here.....I will appreciate all of your guidance.


 I don't know how to tell......but won't they if her own bodily functions get in it ?


 My mother in law passed this year. She had lived with us for 8 years. She came to live with us a little bit accidentally. She had tripped on a step outside and fell and broke her shoulder. Because she needed help with things for a while when she was discharged from the hospital, she came to stay with us. It wasn't until then that we realized that she was very adept at hiding her dementia and we felt like she was a hazard to herself to live alone and so she stayed with us. We believe her health was better for longer and she was happier being around family. There were many ups and downs and of course as time went on, the downs became more frequent. At a point, her doctor insisted that she go on hospice because we needed ""help"" and couldn't do everything! We never knew that they were available to help for persons with dementia and what a blessing it was. I don't know if this is available for persons with dementia in all areas but if it is it will help you to keep your sanity. They are absolute angels!


 I'm so sorry that you, your family and your mother are going thru this. I know only too well the feeling of helplessness and heartache of having to deal with horrible condition. I took care of my grandmother for 5 years before I had no choice to put her in assisted living. Please know that we are here for you any time of day or night. We understand what you are going thru.


 Are her bedsores getting infected?


 Yes, it's possible. It depends on how severe they are. Most times bedsores can be protected with a cream applied liberally. But if they become infected, they will look very angry red around the edges and/or ooze. Here's a website that will tell you more about how to treat them properly: www.mayoclinic.com/health/bedsores/DS00570/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs"
"My Sister, Alzheimer's and Me","I'm a new member; I started with the Depression Forum with a Subject of Depression in the 60s. I was ""looking for a tribe."" As I kept posting, I realized that I have material to post on half a dozen of the forums, but one thing that is constantly with me and my depression is my sister who has been in an assisted living facility for 2 years with Alzheimer's. My sister is 16 years older than I, but for the last 25 years she was my best friend and confidante. She was widowed at 50; I, after a brief marriage at 19, have remained single my whole life. We told each other Everything. Her descent into Alz. was awful for us both. She began to distrust me and eventually became convinced (with the connivance of her gentleman companion) that I was after her money. Her two sons were in denial, and I believe hoped that I would take care of everything. I might have been able to, but just as she was losing trust in me, I contracted cancer and couldn't drive the 300 miles to help care for her. (Oh, I'd arranged home health care, but there's no substitute for being in the same town.) Finally, after she married her gentleman companion and he began to mistreat her, one of her sons came out of his denial and took her to a home in the state where he lives 1000 miles away from me. It's what had to be done. At first I felt guilty that I couldn't take care of her, but since I never fully recovered my health--the cancer was v. minor, but I kept getting hit with health problems--I realize I couldn't have managed. It's 5:00 in the evening; I have a headache from being on-line, my wrists hurt from scraping on the laptop and I'm tired. But it's that awful time of day when I'm, as they used to say in books ""at sixes and sevens."" There's nothing but me and the depression, that lead overcoat that doesn't have buttons. In an hour there's a tv program I watch that will lull me to sleep around 8:00. That means I'll wake up at 2:00 A.M., but bad as that is, it beats the awfulness of the late afternoon. Yes, this is another tale of woe. And I haven't even gotten to my sister and her difficulty in adjusting. I want to read and comment on other posts, but I guess this is how one has to begin, pour it all out. I've poured it out in my journal; I guess I want to try this Forum and see if it helps at all. The physicality of typing seems to help somewhat. I'm at my wits' end; I have tried almost everything that one is supposed to and I still feel awful. I have to follow the guidelines for posting so I won't say anymore.","I'm sorry to hear about your sister AND everything YOU are going thru. :( But please know that we are here to help you in anyway we can. We may not always have the answers but we are a ""shoulder"" to lean on. I just want to comment about your sister not trusting you; do not take it personal. People that have AD can be easily manipulated because essentially they revert back to having the mind of a child. It's terrible what this ""gentleman"" did but hopefully it's not irreversible. Hang in there and come back to post whenever you wish okay?"
Swallowing with Alzheimer's,"My wife is 79 and was dx with Alz about 5 years ago at University of Cal Hospital in Sacramento. She was on aricept and namenda. She has been loosing weight, has lots of congestion, not eating well and spitting up a lot. She has gagged a few times. She has had a throat swallow and chest xrays which showed nothing abnormal. Family MD sent her to allergist and the tests did not sho any allergy issues. However when he was examing her throat the other day he touched the back of the throat with the wooden thing and she did not gag. We see her MD in the AM. I suspect she will go to a liquid diet. Her memory is very poor but does know the family. She acts lethargic and looks off into space for much of the time. I fear dhr is going into the late stages of this horrible desease. What kind of experiences on this have other members of this forum had and any suggetsions.","You might have to purchase a container of powder thickner to mix in to liquids so she would need to chew it. It will go down better. call a pharmacy. Betsey


 My Mom has a swallowing disorder as well, and she is on mostly a liquid diet. The thickener is a must. Also, the memory care facility she is in now gives her something called a ""Magic Cup"" and you can freeze it like an ice cream or eat it as a pudding. It's really great stuff and she loves it. She pretty much eats that for every meal.


 My mom can still eat solid food but does choke on liquids quite often. She has trouble controlling the rhythm of swallowing. She also will not swallow unless she's chewed so this is true with medication too and that's not good with the time released pills. It really is a waste against time to find a cure for this horrible disease. How many more of our loved ones and us for that matter will have to suffer this before someone finally figures out how to get rid of it once and for all. I keep hoping it will be something that already exists that is being used for something else and someone discovers it by accident so that it will be available that much quicker. Crossing my fingers...


 I would think the increase in Namenda and Aricept may have caused the dizzy spell.


 I'm sorry that you are all going thru this. Usually loss of the swallowing reflex does indicate the late stages of AD. I have no advice for you, but hopefully some other members will come along to help you soon.


 Meal times need to be slow and unhurried. Allow about an hour for each mealtime. Make sure she remains sitting in an upright position while eating and for about 30 minutes thereafter. (Aspiration pneumonia is a risk at this stage.) It is recommended to keep bites or spoonfuls small, starting with 1/2 teaspoon and increasing to only 1 teaspoonful at a time. Thickening is a must, but avoid turning liquids into complete solids. Eventually she may loose interest in eating, which will be harder on you than it is on her.


 What you are going through is extremely difficult. My father past of this disease less than a year ago. Once my dad stopped eating solids and moved on to soft foods because of the difficulty swallowing my mom did a lot of research online to find ways to make the foods have flavor. He was in at home hospic at that point. It helped. As I am sure you have read, no one knows how long from this point. I remember wanting to know and read online nightly looking for the answer. For my dad, he lived a few more months past this part. Feedings did take a long time and it got to the point where we had to coach my dad to swallow. My dad was very similar to how you described. He always remembered family. He always knew my mom and he would call the the daytime sitter me. He knew me most of the time and always thought my son was me his last months. Cherish your time, think of the feedings as your time. Talk to her. She will have moments of clarity and you will feel like you have her back for a few moments. Take advantage of these times. I wish you and your family the best.


 My Mother has had Alzheimer's for the past seven years and has always had this choking problem with and without eating. Her voice even will get horse sometimes and she will cough up phlem once in awhile and try and clear her throat. She eats very well, but her memory is very poor. Her doctor has tried antibiotics, nasal spray and allergy pills. None have worked and he says her throat looks fine. He has increased her namenda, aricept, and her anxiety meds. She has lost some weight but she looks good. She had a dizzy spell yesterday in her room and almost fell."
My Father Has Alzheimers But My Siblings Are Nuts,"My Father is ninety-three and has advanced Alzheimer's disease. He is completely dependent on being fed, diapered, dressed, bathed and so on. My brother and sister and I have cared for him at home as his diseased has progressed. We also cared for my Mother who passed away a few years ago. We have been doing this for over ten years now and, even with some help, it has taken a major toll on us. I have been disabled from before my parents started needing all of this care. My siblings decided that my parents must live at home until they die no matter what. I told them a long time ago that my problem was progressive and I could only do this for so long. But, they live in this constant state of denial. My Father really should be handled by two people which can't always be done at home. He also yells a lot which is becoming extremely stressful and he chokes because he no longer spits out anything, but I have no way to aspirate him. He doesn't recognize us and doesn't speak with us. I keep telling my siblings that he should be in an advanced care facility. My sister goes into these fits and yells and tells me I don't love my father and, if she doesn't get what she wants. Then she starts bawling until she makes it impossible to have a rational conversation. This problem is getting worse and she has become a terrible bully. She thinks I should be a martyr just like her and stick it out to the end. (My sister is fifty-eight years old) My brother just does what whatever my sister wants because he still lives at home and she babies him. While father is there, he has someone to do his cooking cleaning and shopping. So he can have a job and farm and come home to a hot meal on the table. After the last time my sister went off on me, accusing me of drugging father which was completely without merit, I told the both of them in writing that I have had as much as I can take and on Dec 9, when I turn fifty, I no longer will care for father at his home. I have had to make tremendous sacrifices for so many years and I just can't do it any more. My sister says that she'll just take care of him herself (even though she has two knee replacements and she is trashing them by lifting too much weight). My brother won't grow a spine and confront my sister about her growing mental and physical issues. I believe that we are simply not fit to care for father at home and he needs to be in an advanced care facility. I think my sister has an unhealthy distrust of medical professionals that could end up harming father. My sister insists she knows everything and the medical professionals and I and anyone else who disagrees with her are wrong. I feel I am giving my siblings plenty of time to make other arrangements. But I fear that my sister isn't going to exit her fantasy world where she is the princess and everything happens as she says. I believe that my sister and brother will do absolutely nothing to get ready and end up causing a huge mess which they will try to blame on me. (She probably thinks she can pressure me into staying.) Should I be able to tell my siblings that I quit and how do I protect my father from their shortsightedness?","Thank you for your reply. I am not clear about what kind of social worker to contact. Under what title would they be found?


 Hi there, Lanie, don't mind this, its a combination of my medical training and personal experience. Ok, here's a few ideas. I actually found this site very tremedous help when I was caring for gma. First, don't quit. Stand back and let your sister try. When she fails, simply say ""are you sure you don't need any help?"" Second, call Adult and Family Services and ask to speak with the social worker in charge of elderly. Nothing is wrong, but you as an in home caregiver are granted services. Services of many needs such as: a break to do things you want whilst others care for him in his home, food services, cleaning services, respite care, support groups, so on. Third, I am not sure if this applies, but ask the doctor if a med adjustment is in order. The only reason why I bring this up is because Gma has vascular dementia and I was telling Lanie all the things and everyone else that was happening here, and it was suggested that Gma may need a med adjustment. A few weeks later, it got to the point where I was actually being strangled, beat up, punched, and more. After 20 minutes (when the doctor said only allow 10 before calling 911) I gave in and called 911 on my cell. I stuck the phone back in my pocket and hoped the dispatch heard me. Thankfully they heard me saying things like ""grandma please stop hitting me"", I just said it like that and whatever she was doing. I then said ""grandma you live at ___"". I did it that way because I heard if they are in an aggressive mood that it can provoke more behaviour . The police and paramedics came. They took her to the hospital where she attacked a nurse, actually physically threw the hospital bed matteress at a nurse, managed to escape the bed netting, and was put in restraints and admitted to the physc ward. It was then my mother, Gma's power of attorney, finally believed me that she needed a med ajdustment. This new medication is a godsend, I love it. Be thankful you have your sibblings to help, I was taking care of gma 24/7 and only got my mother to give me 3 hours off a week. Also pray, if you do.


 Well,....things have changed quite a bit. I told my family that I was quitting in December and they needed to make other arrangements. I was hoping that might persuade them to look into advanced care facilities. My, sister, not to be outdone, went and hired more help that we should have had a couple of years for father. Then, they booted me out, COMPLETELY! She and my bother went through the entire house and removed all traces of my ever being there. They got rid of the foods I used to cook with when I was caring for father, right done to a bottle of soy sauce. Any shoes, shirts, socks and such were boxed up and I was dismissed last week as though as was being removed from a job. This behavior is typical of my sister's obsessive behavior. She made certain that I was dismissed like one of the help and on her schedule because she had to prove she was going to have the last say. I'm not not the least bit upset about leaving earlier than I expected. But, I am concerned about father getting what he needs. Neither my sister or brother will tell me what goes on in my absence.


 The Office of Aging is another place you can call and get a well being check for your Dad. That office really helped me when I was caring for parents. Keep us posted on how things are going. Soft Hugs Betsey


 Hello and I am sorry to read of your problems. Does your Father have a social worker assigned to his case ? He would benefit and so would you from a social worker to advocate just for your Dad. Alzheimer's Association 24-hour Hotline telephone number, 1-800-272-3900. Also I would talk with your Dad's Dr. You must put your own health first and in this case the social worker would be able to share all the options and services provided for you Dad. Be Well, Kitt


 Ardose, there are different kinds of social workers. I think Kitt was referring to the social workers that work for hospitals. They help patients coordinate medical care after they are discharged from the hospital. They help the patients and their families contact different services available in the city to patients. It's hard for a person to know what's available, so the social worker is very informative. Also, for senior citizens, there are many services in a city that can help. Your dad may qualify for different forms of help because of his age and medical condition. Have you spoken with Medicare or Medicaid or any insurance that he may have? His doctor is also a place to get information for care for your father. He needs more professional help than what he is getting, in my opinion, from what you've written.


 I can see this from several sides.. My father died from Alzheimer's two years ago. He died shortly after being admitted to a nursing home. His health was fine when he was admitted, he was their because he had become abusive. My grandmother died from complications from poor care at a nursing home. My mother is now in assisted living, we wanted her to live with us but her mental health issues made that impossible. I guess you know your limitations so only you know what your capable of. This is a very difficult disease and the family really needs to be in unity. For me though I would try very hard to come up with a solution that doesn't involve placement.


 That is not good, I'd call your father's social worker and ask for well being checks. Legally you can even do that with the police as well. I've had the police do well being checks and found out the guy was dead. Kid you not, I called a Nursing Home, that he was in, and they had NO clue that he was dead because they let him ""leave on his own accord."" I notified the police to make sure they weren't yanking me, and left a voicemail on social services.. they came back to me and found out he was dead. There was a massive investagation, and the place was shut down on negeligence (sp). I do hope you can found out about your father"
Caretakers like me? Single not by choice,My boss and co-workers know about my mom's condition (Parkinson with Dementia) I tell them about my ordeals nearly every week. I always shake my head in disbelief when they ask me why I don't date or if I want to try on-line dating. My only explanation for this absurd question is that they think I don't have time to look yet I would have time to see someone if I had the chance??? I am the sole caretaker for my mom and that alone should be explanation enough. Does anyone share my predicament? My immediate thought is to yell and say I don't even sleep through the night because I have to take my mom to the bathroom 2 times a night and I rush through trips to the supermarket because every extra minute i use up I'll have to pay the lady watching my mom for me while I'm at work. Instead I say I'm too old or there is no one out there for me. Yeah I just make excuses that regular people can relate because they don't know what it's like to care for someone to the extent that i do. That's why people say Alzheimer's is the long good bye. It lasts years and outsiders forget that there is so much care involved and goes on and on and on... You tell someone you have a family member with Cancer and of course the issue of dating would never be brought up. I don't get why people think it's different.,"I've talked about my mom to them almost weekly and they act like they understand my hardship but this clearly tells me they don't. I see my friends about every 6 months or so and I've limited them to about 2 or so now because the more friends you have the more time it takes to see them. So in your situation it would be like someone asking you if you ever thought of joining a gym or a social club to meet new people. Time is required to do everything. When that's lacking there is no further discussion needed. People that only have themselves to worry about really live in a bubble.


 Thank you for truly understanding. Do you know the ironic part of this is? These people say stuff like this and then forget about it but the person on the receiving end gets hurt for days afterwards. They don't care to begin with so they make comments the same way.


 Good gosh! you poor thing. Luckily for me, my mom doesn't have a mean bone in her body so she's never attacked me. She was always a victim of circumstances so she never acted out her frustrations. She always kept bad things to herself. Of course i get days where I am just completely exhausted from working full time and then having to do instant laundry because she peed out of her diaper and onto her bed sheet when I forgot to have her sleep on top of her liner or have her slide off the couch and takes me 40 minutes to get her up and having every muscle in my body in throbbing pain from lifting dead weight. Then there are days where she smiles and hugs me and pats me on my back when i sit next to her. I try to focus on those days and imagine being 5 years old again and having my mommy protect me from the evil world we live in. I haven't slept through the night in over 5 years. I feel so different from people around me who go out and have dinner with friends or go to the beach or travel. Geez I just want to get more than 5 hours of sleep in a row for once. That is heaven to me. These are things my older sister gets to do but not me. Same family different fate.


 I do have someone watch her from the time she leaves daycare center to the time I get home from work which is 4 hours a day. That's all I get. I live in California and the state is broke. The daycare centers are about to close at the end of the month due to budget cuts and I don't know what i will do then.


 Make calls to who? I'll just have to pay out of pocket to have someone watch my mom during the day time in place of daycare center. I just have to remember people are hurting all over. At least I have a job that I like so to me that is my free time away from home stress. One day at a time....


 I do have this service. For us it's called in home support and I already have as many hours as the state will allow. Unfortunately like I said the hours I have only covers the time my mom leaves the daycare center to the time I get home from work. I still don't get a break after work. When I complained about the lack of hours i receive I was lectured by the social worker that it is only a supplement to help out, they are not responsible for my mom, I am. Enough said. I also do not like to be monitored or screened for fraud which is happening a lot in the state. I'm self sufficient and I work to support my mom and me and I'm grateful for this additional help. I shouldn't complain. I think people get too comfortable with govt assistance and start to demand it as if they are suppose to get it. Nothing is free in this world. You get govt money then you get watched like a hawk. I prefer my freedom.


 ahh, go one state above, and we have great elderly resources. ~per the rainy state of oregon


 I am not single but we had each parent with us when they needed care. I worked full time and had a paid caregiver for 9 hours during the day, then i cooked, cleaned the house, did everyones laundry, picked up meds, took parent to doctor, to hospital. when we had to have a caregiver at night I had to check every 2 hours to see if the caregiver was sleeping or not. I was exhausted every day when I went to work. When that parent passed away then 1 month later another parent stayed with us. Both my husband and I are only children so no siblings as backup. I understand how you feel,eventhough a woman is married dont assume the husband helps in the care of a parent. It was like I was single. I will pray for you and take care of yourself Soft Hugs Betsey


 I'm not single - been married for 22 years, but I understand what you're saying. It's hard on a person to be a sole caretaker. Even though I had my kids and my husband to help me out, it still felt like I was the only one. My gma was a bit stubborn and wouldn't let my husband nor my daughter help her however my son could do no wrong. I still had a hard time just getting out of the house. I could only imagine how hard it would be to actually go on a date or to just go out and have a life. Yes, people just don't understand. But that falls into the category, if they haven't walked in your shoes, how can they possibly know what it's like? That sort of thing. You can either ignore them or explain to them what it's like. If they understand - great! If not, walk away.


 Bella, I'm not single either, but I was the sole caretaker for both of my parents -- not an easy task and as patient as my husband was, I know he was feeling like he was by himself a lot. But, at least I had some respite by being able to go home and have the caretakers take over. Not that they weren't calling all the time though! Even though I didn't live there, I still took care of all the shopping, doc appts., meds, etc. (and still do even though my Dad has passed) It's not easy and there is no time in between working and taking care of their needs. I don't even feel like I've had time to fulfill being a wife. Now here's the part I have to admit I feel bad about . about 2 years ago, one of the ladies in the office was the sole caregiver for both of her parents and she lived with them. They were so ill, but she worked and had full time caregivers and she told all of us constantly about what was happening with her parents. We sympathized, but now I know I didn't sympathize to the full extent. Why? Because I didn't really know what she was dealing with. I knew, but hadn't walked in those shoes. Now I can fully sympathize with her. Just wanted to say that I can totally feel your anguish. It's not easy being a caregiver ((hugs))


 We understand more than you think. I was sole caretaker of gma, and my mother seriously only gave me 4 hours a week off. What I finally did is called Adult and Family Services and asked for the Worker who handles In home Elderly care. I managed to get on a program where I could have 20 hours a month off, and it was paid for to have a registered nurse watching gma. It takes a special person to do what we do, and don't forget it. But remember in order to take care of them, we must take care of ourselves (Sherry drilled that in my head). I managed an entire year taking care of Gma and being in chemotherapy at the same time. Her medication was needed adjusted, my mom wouldn't listen. It got to the point where I decided to listen to Sherry and everyone else when gma had me corned strangling, kicking, biting, hitting, trying to pull out my PICC Line (an IV that Stays in your arm even at home), and much more. I did only thing I could do, grabbed my cell phone out of my pocket, dialed 911 and hit send then shoved the phone in my pocket. I prayed that the dispatcher heard me despite it being in my pocket. Gma gets worse if you talk about her and not to her when she's in one of those states, so I simply kept directing it at her, ""grandma please stop hitting me, grandma please stop strangling me"" 'grandma you have alheimers"" I said alzheimers because police are more familar with alzheimers than dementia. I was alert ing them of the situation they were coming into that way. They sent police and medics. The police talked her into going to the hospital by agreeing I was a crazy lady and if she got in the ambulance she wouldn't see the crazy lady again. At the hospital, she attacked a few hospital staff, and won restraints and the netting over the bed. Then a trip to the mental ward, where she attacked them, but they managed to get her on a wonderful med. The point of the story, do not let it get to where it got me. If it wasn't for Sherry, I don't know what I would of done. (love ya sherry )


 Why dont you call Adult And Family Services. I qualified due to income 20 hours a month... If i was exhausted, I'd have the respite nurse come in for 4 hours and I slept. I transformed the indoor garage into an office, with a hide a bed couch... I seriously would just go in there and sleep. You need to take care of yourself hon, so you can take care of mom.


 The end of the month is in a few weeks, I'd definately make some calls if I were you. Perhaps on your lunch hour at work?


 Adult and Family Services. You qualify for respite care. It is based on your income on how many hours you can get. If you are that high incomed to not qualify they can at least point you the right way


 It really does depend on what state you are in. I too am in California and there are limited services compared to Pennsylvania where my husband's parents live. They have several resources to help with care for my mother-in-law who has severe Alzheimer's. They now have full time care provided by the state...not sure that's ever going to happen in California given the state of our state!


 We are thinking about it Smurfy! We are nearing retirement age; and now have high deductible health insurance thanks to my ""large"" company giving into corporate america thinking -- not sure if you have some sort of insurance for retirees? If not, then maybe we'll go to Canada, ha.


 Hi Betsey, If you had to check on the caregiver every 2 hours then why have one at all? It's like doing the work anyways AND paying someone to do the work again. Yes I understand the woman always do the grunt work but.... at least you had your husband for heavy lifting work if you needed it right? My mom always slipped off the couch and it always took me at least half hour to an hour to lift her back up. This is when a big strong man would come in handy. I tried looking into getting something to help with that but what I have found is crazy expensive so never mind. Being an only child is not much different even if you had siblings. There is always one person who does all the work anyways. In my family that would be me. I am the youngest of 4 but the only one living with my mother in the same state so lucky me. I always cringe when I hear people being older parents. Those poor kids will be doing what we're doing that much sooner. It's always ""oh I'm healthy and more responsible now then when I was younger so having kids now is way better"" Yeah, if only people stay healthy until they are 100. Thank you for understanding what I go through. It's good to know I'm no alone."
"Sounds selfish, but I want my life back","Both my husband and I have parents that retired at 52. I lost my father in October at the age of 87, and my mother has dementia -- not fun. He's back in Philly right now because he almost lost his Mom, now he waits for the unknown, and his Dad wants him to stay longterm. I'm soooo tired. Our vacations have been to Philly to see his parents. My vacation was to take care of my ailing father and mother. I know it sounds terrible, but it's been years since I've had an actual time out. I worked, took care of them. Now I have my husband gone for weeks at a time. And he's unemployed; we need him to work!!! I'm not sure who is going to give first. We are just done. I thank them for raising us, but gawd, how long does this go on? I just want a normal life. We moved my mom to be closer to my sisters, and they can't believe how much work it is; and she is in a facility. I just don't want to put my kids through this. So depressed right now.","Yes, his brother in the only one back in Philly, so he really gets all the brunt of this and I know it's only fair that my husband is back there taking care of things and giving his brother a break. But at the same time, I'm just tired of having to do this. It's expensive, and we really can't afford it. I think I'm just belly-aching, but needed to vent a little. I would really love a blue ocean and white sand beach right now!!


 My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's over 8 years ago and shortly after diagnosis, she moved in with me and my husband for one year. During that time, I found myself thinking you spend half your life raising your kids and now the other half caring for parents...when is ""me"" time? And yes, I feel selfish saying that. It's not like I resented raising my children. I truly loved it. I guess I just wasn't ready to be doing this now. I was only able to care for mom in my home for one year, I became really sick from all the stress from the disease and how she was. She is in assisted living and yet it doesn't seem much easier now. I visit her at least 3x a week and talk to her by phone several times a day and when I'm not with her or talking to her, I am thnking about her, wondering when will I get that phone call telling me she can no longer be in assisted living? It's a lot of stress and a lot of worry. Mom turned 90 last week, bless her heart. I sometimes wonder if she will outlive me Miriam


 Hi Lonie Your name caught my eye from seeing it in the UC forum and I wanted to pass along some info I heard last week at a woman's group I belong to. The speaker's topic was Alzheimers and other cognitive diseases. She gave a startling statistic-- 63% of caregivers will die before the Alzheimer's patient. She also said that it takes 4 people to care for 1 person with AD. Her important message is that the family needs to take care of themselves first or they will not be able to care for their loved one. I live in Florida in an area of older people and this is a fact of life for many here. I strongly suggest you and your husband get together with social services with other family members and map out a plan that will not drain your lives of health and money. Hard decisions have to be discussed and then acted on. Alzheimers is in both my and my husbands family but we escaped being caregivers for parents because they died of other things before it became a problem. Live your life. At least you have other caring siblings, that itself is a blessing.


 Does his dad have AD or dementia?


 Have you guys considered being a POA for his mother and/or father?


 Yes, I know about that! I would rather have a root canal than what the companies put us thru to handle everyday affairs for our loved ones without that golden ticket (POA). Your husband and his brother has to sit down and a real heart to heart with their dad. If they think he is incompetent to handle his financial affairs, it would be in his best interest (in the long run) to have his sons take over by them declaring mental instability. It's a harsh blow and should be used as a last resort but it's better than knowing that their father is going to be thrown out in the street for failure to pay his bills. I hope they can talk some sense into him. Btw, I have one of those stubborn fathers as well.


 Aww Carol, I'm so sorry to hear of your MIL's passing. :( My condolences to you and your husband.


 Yes, I'm around Detroit. Detroit is a large city with different borders to different towns. Let me know when you know the details. Maybe we can finally catch up with each other and meet for lunch. Next week, is that when the service is being held?


 Okay, just shoot me an email as the time approaches. :)


 I thought the same thing when my Gma lived with me Carol. I would feel guilty or selfish for wanting ""me"" time because I felt I had to be there for everyone but especially her. She wouldn't listen to anyone but me. Than I came to the realization that I was wearing myself down. What good was I if I fell apart??? I started delegating duties....my daughter was still too young but my son did an awesome job of keeping an eye on my Gma and I started using my brothers to help. Does your hubby have anyone in Philly that can be his contact instead of going there all the time? Both of you can't keep going on like this, but I understand the sense of obligation you feel but at the same time wanting ""me"" time.


 Hey, vent away! This is not easy I know :( Hang in there! (hugs!)


 Thanks Sherry and MtLady. Even though my Mom is in a memory care facility, she still can't remember one second from the next, and she can call endlessly...even though now we are 3 hours apart. My siblings are doing double time just like I did to take care of her, and I know back in Philly my husband's brother and family is doing everything possible to make life liveable for his parents. I thought today that I have to remember how much life I've already been through; loss of husband's, living with a chronic illness, etc.; but really it's all a moment in time when you think about it. I know this too shall pass and I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading and feeling my emotion. That's what I love about HW; the support is always here when you need it. Carol


 Thanks Imagardener for your kind words. My husband told me last night that it's becoming a nightmare back there and him and his brother are trying to plan on how to take control of his parents bills. It was a struggle with my parents as well, but I finally told them that one day, there will be no heat, no lights, no tv -- if the bills weren't paid. I reminded my husband of that -- and to stand firm with his father. He said his Dad is as stubborn as my parents were; maybe even worse. I know it's all part of giving up the independence. He'll be home next week if his Mom continues to go on. Last night I realized it was about a year ago when things started really spiraling out of control with both sets of parents. We'll just have to hang tough and take time out.


 His Mom has last stage Alzheimers, but now that my husband has been with his Dad for a week, he's starting to believe that he may have dementia as well. They do have a full time caretaker, but she's from another country...and we aren't sure where she came from; such as is she legit? There are no cards, no phone numbers to any agency so we don't know where his father found her. The bills are a mess. So he'll at least have some time to think things through with his brother and figure out some alternatives for both of them. So crazy.


 Yes, we just talked about that on the phone because he is so worries about everything getting paid. My sister and I have it arranged legally that we are in charge of all my Mom's accounts and have POA for everything legal; but my husband's Dad won't let them touch a thing. Not sure how that's going to work out, but my husband has seen first hand how it works -- everywhere you go -- even the cable company, wants the legal docs to show that you have the right to meddle in their accounts. When you show the paperwork it's like gold and the door is open. So, I'm not sure how they will deal with all of this, but at least on my end we are secure.


 Well, my mother in law passed away today. So sad, but yet a sense of relief that she's no longer in any pain and free. My parent's and his parent's never got a chance to meet because of distance, so I told my husband that my Dad probably met his Mom at the door and welcomed her.


 Thanks Sherry; I'll be flying back to Philly next week. Also, I might be in Detroit in the June time frame for a Service Disabled Vet Conference. Can't say the time frame or exact location yet, but is that close to where you live?


 Yes, the service will be on Wednesday. I would love to meet up with you when I'm back in Detroit. I'll keep you posted on the details!"
Not talking much anymore,Does anyone have suggestions as to how I can encourage my mom to talk? She will blurt out a few words here and there but would never repeat herself when asked. She answers yes and no but not much more. She will not talk on the telephone so she stays mum if she's given the phone. She sometimes will pick up the remote control thinking it's the phone when it rings but does not talk into it nevertheless. I feel helpless. I just want to be able to communicate with her and have her tell me when she's in pain or need to eat or go to the bathroom.,"No she still eats like a horse but need to be fed or else she plays with her food. She can walk but need someone close by because her balance is off. She gets weak in the legs and has fallen down out of the blue and constantly feels the need to pick something off the floor which is when she loses her balance and there is nothing on the floor for her to pick up. You know the old saying if you don't use it, you lose it. I feel that's what's happening with her speech. The longer she stays mum the less she will remember how to talk.


 Dementia, particularly Alzheimer's eventually takes away the ability to do everything, including speech. She may not be able to verbalize, but I do believe they still know us and they still can feel love. Be there for your loved one, let them know you love them and are there for them and they do not have to go through this alone


 Bella, my husband and I were just talking about that last night. His Mom has a pacemaker and artificial heart valves and eats quite well, so we wonder if she might still be alive in the next five years. My Mom on the other hand has a swallowing problem and is down to 75 lbs., but is about in the middle of dementia right now. Guess it depends on the individual.


 Alzheimer's doesn't kill directly but the potential complications can. It's wonderful that your mother is eating great! That in itself speaks volumes. When my gma was at the end, she would just pick at her food and her weight got down to 75lbs (she was only 4' 8"") and the doc wanted to put in a feeding tube. I told him that wouldn't be a great idea mainly because she already had a nephrostomy tube (due to bladder cancer) that she kept yanking out. So a feeding tube wouldn't be ideal. Here is a website that can tell you more about the fatality associated with AD: www.ehow.com/about _5545404_causes-death-alzheimers-disease.html You may have to copy and paste the website.


 Sherry, interesting about the feeding tube. They asked if we wanted to put one in for my Mom as well, but told me that it didn't extend life any longer, and was definitely not quality of life either. My friend did that for her mother and it was agonizing for her Mom when they put the food in. So many decisions to make some times...it gets overwhelming. Guess that's why it's good to chat with other who are experience the same issues!


 Doctors job is to save lives. They don't factor in the human side of the treatment.Yes it will hurt yes it's tough to watch but.... all they care is that their patient is alive. My own doctor had told me to put my mom in a nursing home years ago because in her words ""your mom doesn't even know who you are so what difference does it makes who takes care of her now? You need to think about yourself"" Spoken like a true doctor. Like to see if her own kids will do just that to her 20 years from now. Here's my 2 cents worth. Don't do anything you wouldn't want done to you. Just because they appear to not be coherent doesn't mean they don't get scared or have fears of abandonment issues. Do what you can to make them feel loved. Everyone will be at peace in the end. Thank you.


 Quick update - my mom is talking now. Not making sense most of the time but she's talking. Amen! I adjusted her medication and it seems to be helping. My suggestion to everyone is please do not give up. Research and do what you can. Thank you.


 Is she in end stage or near? She may NOT be able to communicate. When AD advances the ability for speech flutters away. Words don't make sense anymore - speaking or hearing them. I'm sorry you are having to see your mother this way. It's rough I know :(


 Bella, my mother in law went through this same stage, and I'm sorry to say that in regards to talking it is the illness itself, and not something you can really bring back. She's at the very end stages of dementia now. She even makes up words for things. She won't eat unless fed because she can't use any utensils anymore. We were told it's okay to let her use her fingers to eat if that's easier for her. I know what a helpless feeling this is; it's horrible to see our loved ones hurting and not being able to do anything about it. Take care.


 I've read experts take on the stages of dementia and the survival rate after each stage. My mom's been like this for the past 5 years so by their estimate she should already have been 10 feet underground by now. So what exactly will cause death for people with dementia? Her doctor said her heart rate is excellent, she has a healthy appetite, and always in a good mood although she refuses to smile for the camera anymore.


 Dying in one's sleep would be ideal.


 Thanks for the link. Doesn't look like the causes are any different than normal folks except Dementia patients can't alert you when they don't feel good or where it hurts to get the heads up.


 Yeah, the doc didn't think it was a great idea either but he offered it. I had to think of my gma's quality of life. It's tough making health decisions on someones behalf. She also told me once, when she was still lucid, that she never wanted to be hooked up to tubes or life support nor resuscitated so I had to take all that into consideration as well.


 That is one thing I tell people; make sure you have a talk with your loved ones to ensure that they have their wishes in your mind. Even if you have it in writing legally, I found myself that when the time comes, there still is a little jag that makes you not want to make the decision on life or death. This is so tough but I think the last few weeks of watching my Dad in pain has helped me through the grieving process -- I know he is out of pain in a better place. The nurses had to give him some heavy duty meds to take him out of his misery, and I had to give the okay, but knowing what the outcome would be. So hugs to all of the caregivers that are out there reading this. It's a tough go.


 That's great to hear :) Thanks for the update."
Father keeps passing out,"My father has Alzheimer's and has been passing out over and over. They have taken him to the hospital several times, saying his heart rate has dropped, sometimes registering at 40 bpm. He looks like he is going into an ""absence seizure,"" but then falls down and loses consciousness for a very short time. He is very weak and sleeps all the time. They finally put in a pacemaker and a week later he had two of these ""episodes"" back-to-back in one morning. He still is fairly early in this disease process. Still eating and caring for himself fairly well. He doesn't wander off, he just wants to sleep and says he's so tired. He is still at home, Mom is still watching after him. Anyone have any comments on this? We'd appreciate any advice. Thanks","Yes, a lot seems to be related to his heart, and having a pacemaker put in was supposed to help, but I'm not so sure yet. We will wait and see. I guess just the overall weakness is what has most of us worried. He has had all the heart tests, nothing is really wrong. He's on meds for bp, just to try to stop this fainting. It's just the ""blank stare"" look when he has these spells that gives us pause... He's 83, but the weakness just seems a little over the top for a man who has hardly been sick a day in his life. Never in the hospital, never had anything wrong but some bp problems. Always been in great shape. Really odd! Thanks for the reply. I was glad to see that this forum works and might be of great help with all the support.


 I don't normally post here, but the topic caught my eye. My father-in-law has been dealing with progressing dementia for several years - not a firm Alzheimer's dx as yet. He's 82. In the last 6 mos. he's had two of these kind of spells. Both times he was seated and just went out like a light - totally unresponsive. Both times he went to the hospital where all kinds of tests were run. They assumed heart because he had a mitral valve replacement more than 10 yrs ago and has been on coumadin therapy ever since. Anyway - couldn't find anything wrong with his heart - no stroke activity - basically no explanation. He also tends to sleep quite a lot. Then a family member remembered he had narcolepsy as a younger man. He could fall asleep between bites of a sandwich. It was something that sort of ebbed and flowed, and though he was diagnosed, I don't think he was ever on medication for it. At any rate - there is something called ""Sleep Paralysis"" that is associated with Narcolepsy. The descript ion of it fit his episodes perfectly. Apparently it often comes on after a high carbohydrate meal - which was the case with him - both times occurred after he'd eaten lunch. His GP isn't convinced - but family members think it lines up pretty well. He also suffers from sleep apnea and sleeps with a Cpap machine. You can google narcolepsy and sleep paralysis and see what you think. Hope this helps.


 I'm sorry that your father is going thru so much. I don't have any advice for you as this seems to be heart related. I know that when someone has heart issues, it can make them very tired as well as the medications they take for it. Perhaps you can try our Heart/Cardiovascular forum to find the answers you seek?


 Just a thought, has he ever had a MRI of his brain to rule out tumors or vascular issues?"
AZ at 54 yrs of age?,"Hi all. I'm a somewhat regular over on the prostate cancer forum, but am checking in here for some words after the awful conversation I've just had with my best buddy and college roommate. his 54 yr old wife has had vision problems for about 18 months. The neurologist they last saw said she was positive that the cognitive deterioration she has experienced is AZ. She has very low energy, all her adrenaline is depleted within an hour of awakening. She can't process any visual stimuli and will get lost out of the house if her ""guide"" is more than 5 feet away. Her memory is still ok, but degrading. Has anybody anywhere seen symptoms like this for a patient so young? The optimist in me says that she is suffering from something yet to be properly diagnosed. They live in central PA and do not have easy access to top-notch doc's or hospitals. Thoughts? Comments? Anything? Thanks. Dave","has she ben checked for lyme by a tick borne specialist or lyme specialist.


 Has she had her vitamins and minerals checked in blood work? It's possible she might be deficient. I have heard of AZ striking someone in their 40's so the 50's isn't too far of a reach albeit rare. If she hasn't had her blood checked lately, they should start there. If everything comes out okay, she can go in for cognitive testing to determine if she does have AZ.


 Unfortunately it is possible. My mom was 53 when we first noticed signs of dementia. It took nearly two years for her to be officially diagnosed. She's now 55 and getting worse. Definitely tell your friend to get a second opinion though. There could be tons of different reasons as to why she's acting the way she is. I hope for his sake and hers that it's not dementia/alz."
Grandmother doesn't eat,"My grandma has Alzheimer's. She hurt her back a month ago and ever since then, she's been depressed and doesn't eat. My mom and aunt make her protein shakes but she never wants to eat. She says she's never hungry. We make her food all the time but she either refuses it or takes a bite and says she's full. We're at a point where we don't know what to do anymore. Any help would be extremely appreciated.","Sitting with her doesn't help and she is on pain killers. She messed up something in her back. It's supposed to take from 4 to 6 weeks to heal. It's been over a month now. She's lost 30lbs in a month and she wasn't big to begin with. We try to feed her little meals often but she claims she's never hungry. She's been throwing up after eating lately, too.. which just makes her want to eat even less. She gets really down about the situation, too. She just wants to feel better. She's had enough. It's really sad.


 ps, you might want to contact her doctor and tell them that she is so nauseated; they might be able to help by giving her something to combat that. The thing that worked the best for my Dad was a 12 hour suppository but they also have many other things that might help as well.


 Smurfy...excellant suggestions. When a parent starts to choke on thickened foods then you dont want them to aspirate into the lungs. I called hospice in to regulate meds and help with making them comfortable. Hospice was wonderful, medicare covered the cost. I just hope that a loving family member can help me when I become elderly. Soft Hugs Betsey


 Have you tried sitting with her and have her eat with you? I used to have to do that with my grandmother. Is she in pain? Does she take pain pills?


 That is very tough. My Mother has never been a big eater, and now has Dyspahgia (along with Dementia), which is a swallowing disorder. She totally stopped eating while my Dad was so ill, and was down to 72 pounds. The caregivers have been making her shakes that have protein powder, ensure, ice cream, and peaches -- but make it thin enough for her to get down. We also add protein powder to puddings, or whatever she can get down. Also switched to baby food as it's more pureed. She likes the sweet potatoes, go figure. And we've also added protein powder to the cut and bake chocolate chip cookies. It's funny because when she used to cook -- it was always a meat, starch, and vegetable; and now I can't get her to eat any of it! At this point, find something she does like to eat. Is it chocolate? Sweets? Salty? And then go from there. Throughout the process of my Mom's illness I've learned that many elderly lose their ""taste"" so sweet or salty things is what they prefer. I cringe because I think she is not eating properly, but at this point they just need to eat something.


 Lonie has some fantastic ideas. As for baby food, I'd recommend making your own baby food over store brought..... Naseau is probably a side effect from her pain killers. I am surprised they even gave her pain killers. With dementia it tends to work the opposite way on people. She probably is in more pain than you think. My grandmother, I took care of her til recently, she has dementia. After her surgery she was given ibprofen for the pain. In my honest opinion, I'd get a new doctor for her and one who actually specializes with Dementia patients. She could be over medicated too. She needs to go see a doctor hon, preferbably whom specializes in dementia. I worked in a kitchen in a nursing facility before I went to CNA for 3 years. An easy way of making thicknesses is adding a tiny bit of liquid at a time. For example: pudding puree (baby food really thick) cookie put the cookie in a blender and add a tablespoon of milk or water. Mix.. add liquid til you get ""pudding"". If needed thinner like mechnical soft foods.. its basically shredding all the food with a tiny bit of moisture to make it like a cooked speghetti noodle when u cut it..soft. We gave grandma 3 ensures a day. After awhile, she thought it was ""too sweet"" so I poured ensure into a glass half way, and then the other half with milk and stirred it. She just loved the ""chocolate"" milk she kept getting. Also til you can get in with the doctor, try even smaller portions Ie: breakfast: 1/2 banana snack: 1 piece of toast, lightly buttered lunch: 4oz chicken noodle soup snack: 3 cooked baby carrots supper: 1/2 sandwhich, 1 cup of broth snack: small smoothie (smoothie consists of fruit, veggies, icecream and ensure/ or milk) (I usually did the other half of banana, icecream, cooked or canned veggie of 1/2 serving so it blends better, icecream, ensure, and i added extra fruit to make it taste real good and so grandma didnt taste veggies). I used ensure, but that was to give Grandma extra vitamins) Doing it small like this, offers her a semi balanced diet. The ensure provides vitamins and minerals. In fact, I drink ensure because I am in chemotherapy and find eating difficult on lots of days. I found it easier for grandma to drink fluids than to eat, although I managed to get her to eat small meals. I would make sure the food was mechnical soft ie: pasta with alfredo sauce, etc and some cooked really soft veggies sometimes i did brocoli, peas, carrots, whatever I had. But if she wouldn't eat for me, I'd go mix half milk half ensure because even ensure has protein and carbs and have her drink that. Another thing, my grandma has a weakness for hamburgers. Seriously, she gets excited when we ask her if she wants to go to McDonalds. She will eat a hamburger and a few fries every time."

Dingwall down the road,"For a few months now I've had an interesting but worrying symptom. I was thinking about a town I knew in The Highlands of Scotland, where we used to live. I then started thinking about where I now lived in Kilmarnock, about twenty miles from Glasgow. The thing was in my mind, Dingwall was now just down the road as a suburb of Kilmarnock. Is this a sign of Alzheimer's or another form of dementia? I suffered two blows to the head a year ago - one of which was sliding on the ice and banging the back of my head, with no after effects but the other included a branch hitting me in the face and causing mild concussion. The above incident has been followed by others, including thinking someone I knew in Inverness in The Highlands, knew people I now know in the village where I live, even though he's dead.","I intend doing that as of today. The question in my head is, is this psychological (i.e. down to depression) or physical (the injuries I mentioned).


 Will do. My point in coming here was to find out if others had experienced this kind of thing. I intended going to the doctors about it anyway. In future I may have questions about my wife's eldest sister and brother, who have been diagnosed with the disease.


 Before you jump to the conclusion that you may have dementia, please have other possible causes ruled out first. You should see your doctor and discuss with him/her about your concerns.


 It's good that you are getting checked out. Better safe than sorry. Please let us know what you find out okay?


 The brain is such a complicated ""computer"". There are so many things that can go wrong that it's hard to determine exactly what is going on at times. Most of the people here are care givers to loved ones suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's. So you may not get a response to your questions.

Does this sound like Alzheimer's / Dementia or anxiety & depression?,"My 86 year old grandmother that I live with had an ""episode"" in May of last year after reading and seeing news about the disaster in Japan after the tsunami and nuclear plant explosion. (She has been an activist against nuclear power all her life so this was a real issue for her.) She started talking strangely and relating tv shows and other things to Bible events. She was unable to sleep and was reading her Bible and other religious books all night, writing stuff down on paper that didn't make sense and shouting out religious things. When I took her to the ER, she was so agitated that several nurses had to hold her down to sedate her. She had never acted like that before. After a week in the hospital and being on Haldol she seemed to calm down. When she got home, I stopped the Haldol because she got the head and hand shakes (tardive diskenesia). She seemed to be ok and much calmer like herself for the next couple of months. During the past year and a half, we have had 5 deaths in the family and she had a disagreement with her son that led to him not contacting us over the holidays. (He lives 5 hours away). Well, she just had another episode last month. She was crying, wondering why her children wouldn't contact her. She felt guilty for not accepting her son's invitation to pick her up to visit his home. (She doesn't drive and doesn't like to travel) She couldn't sleep and was reading books at night again. She started talking strangely again. I took her to the ER and she was again hospitalized for a week. She was very agitated and talked about me like I was still a baby. (I'm 37) This time other meds were tried and they put her on Seroquel 12.5 mg to help her sleep. I worry about this med because it also has warnings about use in the elderly. I am concerned that her doctor wants her to stay on this med indefinitely and her next dr. visit is months away. So far she has calmed down, and is talking more like herself. She can cook, sponge bathe, go to the bathroom, and other things on her own, but needs help dressing. She likes to read and can pay her bills and manage a checkbook. However, she can get a little irritable to me when she thinks I am watching over her and hates when I ask if she is ok. I have my own case of anxiety so it is very stressful for me to think she may have a side effect or a bad reaction to the new meds. She also has congestive heart failure and high blood pressure. Does this sound temporary or like early alzheimer's & dementia? Should she stay on the Seroquel since its a very low dose or try withdrawing to see if she can sleep without it? I have heard this med has bad withdrawals. She has had many tests and has not been diagnosed with alzheimer's or dementia. Any help is appreciated.","My grandma has had CT scan, mri, blood tests, lumbar puncture etc. No evidence of stroke or blood clot or tumor. She seems to be doing ok now on her medications, but has some irritability and constipation. She has congestive heart failure and high blood pressure. She is talking more like herself. I wonder if she will have to be on the Seroquel long term.


 Great suggestions Smurfy!


 Alzheimer's can be tricky to diagnosed until it's blatantly obvious. To me it sounds like possible dementia but we can't know for sure since we can't ""see"" her. It may be that she is not getting enough oxygen in her blood to possible vascular issues. There are just so many factors that can be causing this. What sort of tests has she had already?


 Hi, I also took care of my grandmother, with dementia. A trick that I had up my sleeve was I stayed in my room (with door open) and made sure door alarms were on so I could hear if she tried to leave. I had to run the household. I do suspect she has dementia. When she has the episodes of why no kids talk to her try saying ""its ok Grandma, I'm sure they will call soon."" If she starts an episode that she says something is wrong with her, say ""its ok grandma, its just your forgetters working overtime. it happens to me too."" If she asks why it happens.. ""its for lots of reasons grandma, stress, medications, worrying, oh just lots of things"" It sounds like its vascular dementia, the form my gma has. I recently had put her in a facility though :("

My Mom sleeps practically all the time,My 95 year old Mom has AD and sleeps all the time and is drowsy when she is awake My Mom is now on zoloft and heparin and altace but problem preceded these meds Any ideas to increase alert ness?,"My mom will be 90 next week and has AD and she too sleeps all the time. Well, I'm not sure she is actually sleeping but she lies on her bed all day long. She is in assisted living and they have serveral activities throughout the day and they always try to include her, but she declines. I've read that AD patients become very insecure and their world becomes very small and she is very happy in her bedroom where she feels safe and secure. I visit with her in the afternoons and even while I'm there, she continues to lie on the bed with her eyes closed. She does respond to me when I talk. I believe it is just part of the disease process. It never gets easier. warm wishes, Miriam


 My Mom is too. They come to get her for meals, but mostly she likes to lay on her bed in her room; I think she feels safe there. One night the person taking care of her couldn't find her in the room; she is so small that she didn't notice she was in her bed all curled up with the covers over her. She does that frequently too. My Mother in law who is in a very advanced stage only eats and then goes back to sleep.

Long Term Care - Please Help!,"Hello all, My name is Karla Johnson and I am a 67 year old woman from Texas (yeehaw!). Here is my situation, I hope someone has advice for me as I really need it! I have self diagnosed myself with the early stages of alzheimer's disease. My mother got it as well and I went through the whole process from start to current day (she is in now in a nursing home). Anyways, I was able to find a website that guided me through the application process for Long Term Care in my state (LongTermCareInsuranceFinder.com) and now that I have the quote back for how much it is going to cost me, I don't know if I can afford it! I have looked everywhere and it seems the free quote I got back from them was one of the lowest so that is not the problem, it is just that I have been out of work for quite some time and my husband is long passed away. My funds are running out and I am not sure where to turn next. I fear that I will become a financial burden to my family if I can not afford to pay for this Long Term Care Health Insurance which I think I will very desperately need soon.

 Considering you knew who you were, you honestly do not have Alheimers. Maybe dementia, but not what you are thinking. Some health insurances will cover for long term care, including Medicare and Medicaid. If not, call your local DHS office and ask for the elderly intaker. Some states, like here in Oregon, have depending on your income so many hours of in home help. If you really think you need a nursing home, which I think you dont, I'd recommend the following: 1. DO NOT make interviews to check out the place, just simply GO there and also talk to the residents there, they will tell you if they are happy there. If you find many people not happy, you don't want to be there. 2. I'd recomment something like Farmington Square (a place here in Oregon) because it goes from Assisted Living to the full blown nursing home depending on the level of care you need.


 my mother in law has long term care insurance through AARP it costs 170 dollars a month. i know when we needed to use it for home health care we had to go through an approval process but they finally approved the home health care.


 Hi Karla: It doesn't sound like you're ready for a nursing home yet. When you are and a doctor will confirm it, you can apply for medicaid as long as you don't have more than $2,500 to your name. Please don't worry about this process, we just went through it for my mom and the medicaid people were wonderful. Once her funds were paid down, the nursing home gets her retirement and social security checks and medicaid pays the rest. I know the government negotiates the monthly amount and pays about half what we pay privately (which was $8,700 per month), but nothing in terms of her care, room, etc., changes. Good luck and God bless!


 Check out the NH posted and what the ratings are you will be shocked I am sure Lyn


 Bump Still wondering how you are Lyn


 Here in Pennsylvania ppl can by what they call a cottage which is part of senior care. You are independent as long as you are in the individual cottages. When you become ill and need assisted living or skilled nursing care you get transferred to the appropriate building. It is expensive. Local nursing homes take Medicare patients but they take a percentage of those patients and then private pay patients. Please get checked out by a doctor and then you go from there. Soft Hugs Betsey"

 Adding another funeral :( got a call today, my uncle passed away today Both Aunt and Uncle had cancer and passed from it Step mother died unexpectedly from a massive heart attack whilst in the ER for trouble for ""number 2"" going. I think there is malpractice, and I happen to be not the only one that is questioning it. Its a little odd... a person who has trouble going the two to have a heart attack. I swear, bad things come in 3s


 4's or 6?? Seriously, I have NO clue why God is doing this to us. What is the goal of having so many passing away at the same time? I found out from my biological mother that my grandmother is not expected to make it and the doctors estimated two to three days. I managed to get to grandma today, although I am sicker as a dog and spent hospital all day yesterday. I had glove up, mask up, but at least I was able to tell gma that I loved her and memories whilst growing up. She has dementia, but in my heart I think she will remember. She even knew who I was today (which is progress). The thing I am scared about - I used to work in a nurisng home and they will get ""better"" seemingly then pass away. I am worried that she wont make it through the night. To make it worse, like I said I was in hospital all yesterday. Flare up, Pseudomembranous colitis, gastroenteritis and abdominal pain. I am on some heavy antibiotics now but super contagious hence why when I went to GMA I gloved up, masked up. On the bright side, if she does pass away, Gma's last words were ""I love you"" after I told her I loved her I wanna scream, cry, and omg I so need someone to hold me. I'm trying to keep you guys updated, as you too are family."
Nursing or Assisted Living?,"My mom was diagnosed with vascular dementia 5 years ago. She currently suffers from hallucinations, total incontinence, and is very confused. She was hospitalized for a UTI, and from there moved to a Rehab/Nursing Facility for physical therapy. She has had 3 bouts with cancer (the last time it was lesions on the spine) and it has left her weak in her arms/hands and back. Her doctors advised that she should not return home and requires full-time care. I have been taking care of her for the last 10 years. She hates the nursing home and is not very cooperative with the medical staff. I recently found out that she has some insurance that pays 1/2 of an assisted living facility, but does not contribute to nh care. I found an assisted living alzheimer's facility that houses all stages of alzheimer's/dementia patient from beginning to end. However, they told me yesterday that if the patient ever gets to the point that she is no longer able to feed herself, I will have to hire a caretaker or a family member will have to be there 3 times a day for meals. I'm the only child. I know that she will be happier in her own little suite, but am I sacrificing her care by placing her there? They do have a 24 nurse and 24 hr personal assistants. I don't know what to do.","Sherry, She would be happy at home and I could hire caretakers, but the problem is she is very uncooperative. She argues about everything from taking a bath to changing her depends. That is how she ended up with the UTI and a bedsore. And this was even with home health coming 3 times a week. On their off days, she sat in a chair with the same depends on for 3 days in a row. When I tried to get her to change, she refused. And she smoked at home. She burned holes in everything and we're lucky she didn't burn the house down. I had retired to stay with her, but she just won't cooperate at all. That's why the doctors want her in full time care. When she was in the hospital, she refused to keep her IV in. She pulled two of them out and told the nurses that she was going to keep doing it if they put it back in. She's acting the same way at the Rehab/NH. It took 4 aides to hold her down to take a chest x-ray. She's just too much to handle. But I do want to make sure she gets the best care she can get.


 I'm going to investigate more about the assisted living facility. They say from beginning to end Alz. support, but if they don't feed those who can't feed themselves, I don't think that's right. That IS one of the last stages and you can't wait until they get that bad and then not give them the support that they need. I'll probably leave her where she is. It is a very clean place, no complaints filed and they have a lot of activities for the patients. I hate nursing homes too, and right now my Mom is hating me for putting her in there. Sad places, but I know they have their purpose. At least she is clean and safe. Thanks for your support.


 Here's a few ideas. My gma (RIP, she passed away earlier this month) had dementia. Her doctor said she needed round the clock care, so I moved in. SHe had me 24/7. And it seems like things are esculating to where like Sherry told me before, It sounds like mom needs a med adjustment. As a soul caretaker, you can qualify for in home care, with the Adult And Family Services. You can respite, nursing, cleaning, shopping help. In fact I even did meals on wheels just to give me a little of a break. Sounds strange, but baby proof your house, including the doors and windows. You can get motion door dectors at Walmart, we rigged it to every time the door opened the alarm went off. If I was going out, I would flip off the alarm and enable it again. If that won't work, then it is time for assisted living or nursing.


 It's Genetic, I think I'm getting a little more used to her being there, but it is still hard. The N/H psychiatrist had upped her anti-psychotic meds and the nurse/practioner had to reduce it again because that was when the anger got out of control. I think it's leveling out now. She's a small woman, and it was just too much for her. She also has a new roommate and she thinks it is her sister, so that also has eased the stay just a little. I'll just keep praying it gets easier for her to accept. I sure don't want her hating me for the rest of her life. It's just a tough thing to do to someone who has taken care of you when you needed it. Thanks for your support.


 Are you able to care for her full time? Does she do better being at home? Do you work? Can you hire a caretaker to be with her during the day (or night) if you do work or when you need to go out?


 Ah ok...that makes things a bit clearer. Unfortunately, I hate to say this, and I rarely do because I HATE nursing homes...she might be better off at one. Assisted living centers are more or less for people that can still ""somewhat"" care for themselves. Granted there are AL centers for advanced AD patients, if you can get her into one of those, that would be even better but many of those AL centers don't want to deal with advanced dementia patients even if they say they take them. You can look around and see if you can find an AL center that can care for your mother but more than likely they won't. Nursing homes are designed to handle and deal with advanced patients such as your mother. It's a sad situation all around and I feel for you, truly I do. My heart just breaks for the elderly that are in this situation as well as for the family members. If you decide to put her in a home, look that home up online, with the BBB (if your in the states) or other reviews and make sure they have a high rating. Never ever under any circumstance should a person be put in a home that has complaints filed against them, especially for abuse or neglect.


 I'm glad to hear she is in a place that is clean and has no complaints. She may ""hate"" you now, but just keep in mind that she still loves you if that makes sense? It's a really hard situation to be in, but you have to do what is right not only for you, but for them as well.


 No, you are not compromising her care, Only Child, by placing your mom in a special-care facility. Your mother is not the same person she was years ago, and it's a condition that grows steadily worse. You also must guard your health as well as that of your mother. Placing her in 24-hour care enables you to have some peace in your life. You may always visit each day to make sure she is getting the proper care there, and still return home for rest and calmness. You need that very much. I worried myself sick over the same situation, except that I was not the only child; I was the one who had the situation that permitted me to be a caretaker until Mother had to be placed in a nursing home. I had the support of my brother and sister, but Mom's care was in my hands. Alone, it is much more difficult for you personally, so provide ample time for you to recover from the stress and feelings of helplessness that occur when a parent's life is ending. Visiting her daily if possible provides her with assurance that she is not alone and that she is still loved, despite how angry she may be with you. (Anger is a frustration of the drive for love.)You will have some comfort in knowing that you are doing the best thing possible under the circumstances. (And you still keep your eye on how she is cared for.) Have you thought about having a psychiatrist talk to her for a little while to determine if an antidepressant might work for her anger issues? Or a tranquillizer? Strangely enough, Mother's strokes removed all anger from her. Seeing her each day, even bringing in things like a wallpaper design that you may be planning on doing at home help keep her interested in what's happening in life outside the nursing facility. Bringing a fresh plant or flowers occasionally is appreciated, as well as a treat at times. I remember how much Mother enjoyed being wheeled out to the garden at the nursing home just to sit and look at flowers and the world outside. Take care. Good wishes, It's Genetic Post Edited (It's Genetic) : 4/16/2012 8:31:17 AM (GMT-6)


 Yes, I know it's hard, OnlyChild, and you must understand that she really doesn't hate you. Her world is totally different now from the world you knew as a child. And I know what it's like to take care of a child. It's all part of love, OnlyChild. And it's a lot of love we give them when we help them to have a life as healthy as medical science and a clean environment will provide for a very ill mind and physically weakened body. I'm so glad you have psychiatric aid for her; that should relieve you about understanding how her intellectual functioning has been transformed. It's good that she sees her roommate as a sister. Hopefully, the other woman has a positive view also. Try to have some social life away from the nursing home, Only Child. You need to maintain your psychological health while you're enduring this, and friends who play bridge--if you do--would enjoy having your company. Give time to your husband's interests if you are married, and look for the day when you will have learned through this relationship that you did the best anyone could do under difficult circumstances that are hard for anyone to have to endure. You will be blessed for your sacrifice. My prayers will go up for you and your mother from time to time, and I hope you will continue to post as you feel the need.

How are we doing?,I just wanted to see how everyone is doing? How are your loved ones with AD doing?,"I know, Miriam, exactly how you feel. I watch the decline of my grandmother as well. Like your mother, she was strong in body but frail in mind. AD is a tough road to go down for everyone involved. Does your mother still remember you?


 Thanks for asking Sherry. My mom is 89 years old. She was diagnosed with AD 7 years ago...7 lonnnngggg years. She has been in assisted living for the past almost two years. How is she doing? Physically she is as strong as can be. She just had a bout with a cold and cough that I thought was going to turn into pneumonia, because she spends so much time in bed (she just refuses to join in daily activities) but miraculously, she pulled through and she's fine. Mentally, another story. Those that have traveled down this road understand. I honestly feel she is as happy as she can be. She loves where she lives and tells me often how safe she feels and how happy she is. It is very hard on me, watching her mental decline. I feel as if I am losing her, a little at a time. And so it goes... Miriam


 Yes, she knows who I am and my two sisters. There are times when I walk into her room and she asks ""who are you?"" That's a tough one. The other really difficult one is when she asks if I'm married and then asks if I have any children. I've been married for 30 years (second marriage) and my son is 38, one of seven of her grandchildren. She really doesn't remember them very well, and doesn't realize she has 9 great granchildren. Our kids live all over the country and so she rarely sees them."
Mom and assisted living,"My mom has dementia, but has never actually been diagnosed with ALZ. She is on aricept and namenda which seems to help. I am currently taking her the meds twice a day because she can't remember to take them properly, even though we have done all the normal things to remind her and even made alarms on her cell. We are very close and I take care of all her finances, mail, and meds. She had no other physical issues until 2 months ago when she started having a lot of pain in her back/hip and was diagnosed with advanced arthritis in her spine. She cannot walk to get lunch so I have to buy all her groceries and take her lunch each day. I have a full time job and I am exhausted. I have one brother who helps occasionally. I found a great assisted living 10 minutes from us with high recommendations from other families we know. She will go, and love it, and talk about it positively, but when she gets home she is determined not to go back. I cannot continue and I have explained this to her. I know there are people who recommend telling them that it's temporary and just getting them in there and hopefully they will like it, or just making them stay once there. I just don't know if that is a good idea to force them to go? She has the money to do it. It would be so much better for her as well, as she has no friends and some days tells me that she hasn't spoken to another human being. That is just wrong. This place has classes and 400 residents who are active, trips, water aerobics, etc. I don't want to force it but some people say its the best thing to do? Any advice?","I agree with Sherry. My mom was diagnosed 8 years ago. She too is on the same meds as you mom and they have kept her quite stable; in fact, she is still able to live in an assisted living facility and they consider her to be ""stable."" We dreaded the day we had to put her in because she always told us she'd never go. We took her there to visit and her response was ""when can I move in?"" She has loved living there; she's been there now almost three years and feels very safe and secure and happy. If it is a good facility, as you say it is, with all kinds of activities, I feel it is the best place for them. My mom lived in my home with a caregiver, while I worked full time, and then in my sister's home with the same caregiver, and mom was never, ever happy. I believe she was bored to death, even though she refused to do anything we offered. You will have peace of mind, knowing that she is safe and well cared for. You can go visit, along with your brother, and the most important thing is you can take care of YOU. So many caregives burn out. The latest statistic I heard was 63% of caregivers die before the person they are caring for...talk about stress induced illness. I wish you well Miriam


 I was a CNA, and in a nursing facility. I will tell you straight up you NEED to inspect the facility first. Go there without an appointment, and be sure to talk to the residents. Keep your sniffer aware (nose) and if you smell something funny, report it, and visit with others near by. See how long it takes the elderly to be changed. Many facilities just really don't care, and I worked long days to make sure my residents were at least given humany decency. The facility I worked at was notorius for leaving the elders in their soiled garments. The trick to being a caregiver is not burning out. I've also done home care. I took advice of this site and got my gma the help she needed. You can call DHS and ask for the Elderly intake... you can get respite, that will give you breaks. I used my respite either to run to the hospital and do my chemotherapy or run out to the indoor gargage (which we turned into a rest quaters) and would sleep on the hideaway bed we'd keep out there with bedding, heater, small fridge with osme snacks/drinks, and a computer. But I was usually sleeping if not running to the hospital and getting my iv bags. There are so many things you can do. There is adult day care you can have her do, which gives you half a day to 8 hours to do what you need. You need to take care of yourself too. Oh, and Meals On Wheels will deliver meals too. I had Meals on Wheels come once a day, and they even provided a second meal for me. It was nice to get a break from that one meal. I also would cook and bake once a week - baked enough muffins, breads, etc for a week and cooked that day enough for 2 days of food. Any left overs I stashed in the freezer and at the end of the month I'd make a quiche or a sheperd pie with it like: veggies, cheese, ham... hmm hey make a quiche. Always had those premade pie shells in the fridge :p Another thing I did is about once a week I'd pull out that slow cooker and make a soup or stew


 Gundrun; your sentence, ""Guilt can seep in still, but I have to keep telling myself that she is in the best place for her, and that when she grieves she is not grieving her loss of home but the loss of her old self which Alz took from her"" is so right on. This is the way most of my family has been feeling and you definitely put the words to it. Thanks!


 If your mom is unable to care for herself or keep herself safe, other than hiring a caregiver, an assisted living center is the place she should be. It's never easy putting someone we love in these homes but the alternative is not feasible either. Have you thought about hiring a full time live in caretaker?


 i am a nurse and i can tell you the biggest hurdle is getting her there. after a couple weeks i have seen people with dementia who are mad at first about being there but then they have formed companionships with other people who are also experiencing similar issues. so it really turns out o be the best thing to do for them.


 I was a full time caregiver for my Mom in her house for more than a year and finally burned out. With moderate Alz/dementia my Mom had begun to become more withdrawn and lose interest in everything including social gatherings or visits with friends and began to rely on me for entertainment. We all (sibs and I)visited a nice assisted living facility and she loved it, and we did our homework and it was the best we found by far. We explained all about the move and why, which we had to repeat for a month before the move happened. Initially she thrived in her new environment even though for a few weeks her confusion was understandably much worse. She loved the stimulation, she got much more exercise as in this environment she actually will use her rollerator because she's not the only one. But lately, I think as the disease progresses, she has started repeating herself a lot, wondering when she will becoming home which is no longer a choice. We have been clear as to this, but it is promptly forgotten. She reasons that if only we gave her her car back she could live back in her home alone again... My heart is broken when she brings these things up because it seems sometimes that only because of my wanting my life back and needing to go back to my home on the other side of the country is the reason she is where she is. Guilt can seep in still, but I have to keep telling myself that she is in the best place for her, and that when she grieves she is not grieving her loss of home but the loss of her old self which Alz took from her. So it may be hard but the best thing is my advice. Do not look at the move as forcing her but that it is the best option that you as her caregiver can make for the both of you. Also, she can be more independent within the more safe environment of assisted living; after a while all I could do was point out her limitations (no driving, no cooking, etc) which were often met with a challenge. She does have many more friends now, and a regular schedule which is very important."
"Dad living alone, in anther state with dementia","Our dad moved from California 34 years ago, with the intent to never come back. He is a veteran of the armed services, we believe he served during the Korean Conflict. Dad is 76 years old; living in New Mexico state where he has no family; and his list of friends are his landlord and adult protective services case worker. He has dementia with limited hearing and does not have medical insurance. His income is minimal and he denied medicaid part A and part B options. Dad never expected to live this long, which is why he refused to accept medicaid. He has a very modest income and holds onto hope of saving most of his monthly income to purchase a small house for himself where no one will control him. Dad's illness has him believing that our offer to help, is our means of controlling him and his money. He refuses our help! He has given his landlord $4500 advance rents, he has approximately $1200 of credits on his utilities. His day to day activities: Sleeps on his bed under a rug; wakes up late. Walks to the local store to get food, returns home where he sits alone with no television, telephone, or radio. His afternoons are quiet. He spends the majority of his days alone with no human interaction. The doctors have diagnosed dad as being competent to live on his own, as long as he has someone to help him manage his day to day living, cleaning, meals, and such. He currently does not have this type of support in New Mexico. Dad has refused social services offer of getting him in home help. The state has placed dad under the care of Adult Protective Services. People are taking advantage of dad through forgery and forcing him to withdraw money from his account. Social services has assisted my sister and I with a durable power of attorney and their concern for his health and well being is causing them to push us to relocate dad to California where he has family. Again, dad does not want this. We are more than willing to relocate dad, but he is refusing our offer to help. We have the social worker telling us to come get him. We have a doctor stating that he is competent to live alone with assistance. We have a landlord saying that the social worker is making more of this than it is. My aunt and sister feel like the social worker is trying to get dad off her case load. We have neighbors forcing dad to withdraw money from his accounts. We have a ********** who he says is like a daughter and he gives her money from time to time for non services rendered. We have dad saying he's not going anywhere and if our intent is to try and relocate him, then we are wasting our time. The state will not make dad a ward of the state. We're faced with him not being able to receive veterans housing benefits since he is not a California resident. The state of New Mexico only has one VA Home, which is 60 miles from his current residence, where he would have to share a room with 2-4 others. How do I get dad to relocate? Social services says medicate him. What happens when the medication wears off? His being a resident of New Mexico means we'd have to house him in our home until we can either get him into a private residency ($2,900 per month) that he can not afford, while waiting for him to meet the CA residency requirements. My sister and I both work full time outside of the home. Dad has a sister who lives 5 miles from me, who is willing to help. Unfortunately his dementia has him believing that his sister stole $67K from him; his dementia causes him to believe he can't trust her; and he says she's to controlling; and he isn't allowing anyone to control him or his money. We are at a loss. We don't know what to do!!! We are waiting for his DD form 214 so we can confirm service during Korean Conflict.","Sorry, I have to disagree. They have full time jobs that they cannot just up and leave. He chose to move to New Mexico and away from his family. I've dealt with this close to home and across the United States, so I can totally understand what you are dealing with. The hard part is trying to get them to do something they don't want to do. Remember; you are still children to them and they don't like us meddling in their affairs...trust me; been there done that. You need to take control by getting a power of attorney and asking the doctor and an attorney what you need to take control of your Dad's medical care and finances. I had to do that with my parents, and my husband with his. If you don't have funding for this, check to see if your company has some sort of employee assistance program. By doing this we were able to contact the doctors ourselves (you cannot per healthcare laws if you don't have legal docs in place) and let them know there is a huge problem going on. This way, they are tipped off when your Dad goes into the doctor and you can work with them to talk to him about issues and what's best for him. For some reason, they trust doctor's more than us, ha. I had to have a real heart to heart with my Dad and let him know that it was time for me to take over the finances -- Mom had dementia and wasn't paying the bills. I asked him if he wanted to wake up one morning cold and with no lights on. That really sent the message home. I tried to be as nice as I could and understanding, but sometimes you have to be firm....as hard as it is. We deal with this on the east coast as well and it's really hard to give tough love, but remember it's for their best interest too. My first suggestion -- get those legal docs in order if you haven't done so already. Good luck to you and keep talking -- it really helps.


 I'm in California as well, and ironically I'm dropping some documents off at the local VA center for my friend who lives across town from me and the place is closer to where I live. She is an expert at the VA system, so if you have any questions, let me know. I know she would be happy to help if she can. Sounds like you are headed in the right direction by getting the doctor to tell him that he's going to move. He is in a dangerous situation for sure. Dementia is a tough disease, and I can assure you when I read what you are going through, I can feel the pain because I know how you are feeling. Keep remembering that your Dad will continue to deteriorate and by doing this now, you are saving him and yourselves a lot of tough heartache down the road. You are good daughters and should be commended for getting your Dad out of this situation. ((Hugs))


 Daddysgirl, I hope for all your sakes that everything works out okay. I know how difficult this is your you and your sister and you both are doing a beautiful and loving thing for your dad. Dementia is horrible. It robs the person of so much and causes so much stress and heartache for the ones that care for the person with dementia. I just want to add one more thing. Besides memory loss and not trusting others, dementia also causes major confusion. My mom has dementia (Alzheimer's) and I find that it seems the confusion causes her more problems than the memory loss. My mom was diagnosed almost 9 years ago and still to this day is very aware of her memory loss. She will tell us ""I'm sorry, don't ask me questions because my memory is very bad."" If two people are talking, having a conversation, she doesn't understand, it is simply too much input. I'm sharing this with you because you might find your dad may also have problems with confusion and hopefully, this might help you. You and your sister sound like very loving daughters. My thoughts and prayers are with all of you and I hope that all turns out well. Miriam


 Good morning Lonie and Miriam, I really appreciate your responses. I have experienced some of this already during my previous visits with my dad. Here's an example: My dad has said multiple times that all women are controlling and each time I reply on this same topic, it makes my dad get upset. Monday the subject came up and it sparked a fuse, that's when I got it. I realized the mistake I had made. Lesson learned from this subject is to change the topic and move onto something else. Lonie, I found out that my dads military records were destroyed in a fire that took place at the National Archive Center in 1973. I have to complete a form that will enable to military to recreate dads records. Real bummer since dad is not able to remember. :-( Thank you guys once again. Your input really helps.


 There is a disconnect on what dad is entitled to. why was he turned down for medicare A & B? He automatically qualifies at age 65. Also, he doesnt have to live in California to get Veterans housing benefits. Those are federal. Also he can receive aid and attendance benefits in addition to whatever pension or social security he collects. Its usually $1600 a month. Your father should not be made a ward of the state. He has familiy. If he wont come willingly then ask a court to compel him to do so. This can be done by having one or more of his children should also become his power of attorney and legal guardian. It is clear that he is NOT competent enough to handle his financial affairs. The landlord is obviously going to tell you its all being exaggerated. the social worker may want him her caseload as it should be. He has family. And it is the familys responsibility to care for him. In the meanwhile, have his doctor refer home health care for him. They will go out several times a week to evaluate him, cook and clean if needed. There are obvious and easy solutions to your situation. You just have to implement them.


 Daddy's girl, I'm sorry if I seemed cold. Unfortunally, I guess I am one of the extreme few who gave up my life I established to take care of my GMA with dementia. I moved 150 miles, within a week to move in with her. I left behind my ""son"" (not biologically, but he is motherless), my son's dad, I moved my pets, I did all that, because I know I needed to. I even quit my job. Now I work from home, selling Avon.


 Lonie, thank you so much for the compliments. I really do try. Thank you for your condolences of all the fmaily deaths as well. It really is hard losing 4 people in the family within 4 weeks. I see the doctor in two days, and I am going to ask him to put me on celexa again just to be safe. I know its a matter of time only a matter of time before the shock gets over.


 You are going about it the wrong way. If he won't relocate, then he won't. You, however, can relocate. Obviously he has dementia, and getting worse. Just tell him you want to come visit him. Move in. Or, hire someone to be a caretaker to him that he trusts. Like the landlord. Pay the landlord to help. If you need to you can technically have him forcably removed by police and moved to you because you have power of attorney. If you do that, then you will have his hallucinations of not trusting you. If you manage to get him to you, you can turn to the VA for housing help. They have homes on bases for temporary housing, as well as homes. And you can have him medicated down there. I'm sure if you call his doctor and explain he'd be happy to get him medical treatment. If the doctor doesnt help, you have a malpractice case then.


 Hello Smurfy Shadow & Lonie Lonie’s response is right on point, my sister and I have full time jobs, mother with health issues, mortgages, children, grand children, and pets to consider. Like Lonie, my sister and I have two aging parents. I already relocated closer to my mother, where I can also assist her as needed. Unfortunately for our parents, the lives of both my sister and I were established long before the deterioration of our parent’s health. Moving in with dad is not an option. Dad lives in a one bedroom rental. He lives very modestly with very few possessions. He owns 2 pairs of jeans, less than 5 t-shirts, 6 pairs of socks, 1 skillet, and place setting for one. He doesn’t own a television, radio, or computer, and he re-reads the few books he has. He does have a cell phone with service that I provided him with; unfortunately he doesn’t remember how to use it. My dad has a giving spirit and people take his kindness for weakness. He has a neighbor who stole checks from his home, forged his signature on 14 checks equating to $3000. This same neighbor did something similar to another local elderly residence. This neighbor was arrested, and charges were brought by the State. My dad was the key witness. The neighbor, his friend let him know that he would be arrested if he showed up in court. Needless to say, dad refused to go to court. He said he showed them, he wasn’t going to allow them to arrest him; he just didn’t show up. Sadly enough, the charges against his accuser were dropped. Fortunately for his accuser, dad’s memory doesn’t allow him to remember any of this; it only allows him to remember her as his friend. Our dad only has two people in his town who have shown themselves as trust worthy; one being his landlord and the other being his social worker. Unfortunately my dad’s case is consuming his workers time and making it hard for her to provide services to other elderly residence who are also suffering abuse. As for trust; dad doesn’t trust any females. His dementia says we are all controlling and trying to take his money. My sister and I haven’t accepted a penny of our dads money. Our visits are fully funded by us, this includes taking him grocery shopping and purchasing things we know he needs. Dad says the local street walker is like a daughter to him. Dementia has caused dad to forget that his daughters don’t accept his offers for money. My sister and I have a DPOA. The social worker has informed us that we may have to have the policy force dad to leave with us. Like Smurfy Shadow, I am concerned about the lost trust from dads hallucinations, but I am more concerned about dads safety. We received news that a complaint was filed by dad’s bank. Apparently a woman forced dad to withdraw $100 for her. Today my sister and I reviewed dad’s bank statement from last month and noticed that dad has withdrawn $1600 in cash, where his usual expenses are about $300. This finding has raised a red flag. As for the VA, we are waiting for his DD form 214 to be sent. California requires residency before the elderly are eligible for services. We are considering the services of the VA when they become available. As for medical, dad currently does not have medical insurance. Dad declined the Medicaid options. He didn’t expect to live this long. Up until 2009, dad had not seen a doctor. I can count on my two hands how many times he’s seen a doctor since then. Lonie’s posting is right on the dot… It’s hard getting someone to do something that they don’t want to do. Dad feels the road is narrowing, he is caught between two wagons, and his life is coming to a full circle. Dad is smart and a real thinker. .. He has given his landlord 1 years of advanced rents because he knows his condition is making memory harder. He’s done the same with his utility companies. During my last visit I had the utility companies put a do not disconnect note on his account with contact info for payments. Dad has been evaluated by a psychiatrist. He has determined that dad can continue to live on his own as long as he has someone to take care of his day to day responsibilities, et. Al. meals, laundry, finances, medical, cleaning… My sister and I are heading out to see dad in a couple of weeks. Again, Lonie is correct, dad does trust his doctor. The doctor is going to let dad know he can maintain his independence by relocating to California or he can become a ward of the state. The doctor has also name me as dads “Payee”. I am named on dad’s medical directive, durable power of attorney, and now his social security. The social worker currently takes and schedules all of dads appointments. I am thankful for her help! This has been really tough. It’s tougher when you have miles separating you and others taking advantage of him with his dementia causing him to be unaware. Dad knows that my sister and I are coming in on March 16th. That afternoon he will find out that he will be going straight from the doctor’s office to the airport; heading to California. Dementia is interesting… Dad told the doctor that his named daughter is a trickster. Fortunately dementia prevents dad from realizing that my name is the name of the one he calls a trickster. What happens next? I have a room in my home where dad will be until we can either relocate him. The doctor says dad is still competent and can live independently with conditions being met. I know I will need to install pull bars and skid protection in the tub. A friend suggested I lock up all of the sharp objects and cleaning supplies. Dads’ familiarity is with a stove and not a microwave. He has a sister and brother in-law with Cancer who lives 5 miles from me. His sister has agreed to stop in and bring him meals while I work. Unfortunately dementia has him believing he doesn’t trust his sister. I am not sure how that will turn out. Dementia also has him not wanting to see or hear from my mother. This means splitting my time between both parents. Since the passing of my step father, my mom spends all of the major holidays with my sister and me. Thank you both for your input, it means a lot. This is all new to my sister and me. Dad will be living with me until we can find him suitable housing. The doctor suggests we find him a place where he can have his own room; he is not locked in; and he can maintain his independence. locations for memory residents are secured. The VA doesn’t offer single rooms and the private residences charge more for this type of request.


 Thank you Lonie, this is really tough. I just purchased my dad a 1-way ticket to California. As previously indicated, my dad is unaware. I sent a copy of his itinerary to the social worker and asked that she forward on to the doctor. I sent my dad the following letter via USmail today: Hello Dad, It is our understanding that the road is narrowing down; the wagons are getting closer; and your life has come full circle. Please note that we are your daughters and we stand before and behind you, right between those darn wagons.  Respectfully, we honor your dignity as our “father” and with that said, automatically grants you worthiness. Our purpose is to be there for you, not against you. We will protect you from any/all harm or danger! Your security, independence and self-control are just as important to us as it is to you. Together, we stand strong and can/will conquer this dilemma. Please know that we love you and only want the best for you. We will be in New Mexico on Friday. Thanks again....


 Excellent point Miriam. You are so right; my Mother says the same exact thing -- she doesn't know what's happening to her memory but the confusion is what causes her a lot of anxiety. When we realized that she was experiencing the first stages of dementia, she would blame my Dad for hiding things or not telling her something -- the list was endless. Poor Dad was so patient and would tell me that he had a friend whose wife had Alzheimer's and he told Dad that you shouldn't argue with them, just accept what they are saying and move to another topic. What we think makes sense -- will not to them. It's a terrible disease and so many of us are dealing with it. Tough stuff!


 Oh gosh, it seems like one thing after another doesn't it? Not just trying to help our parents but the paperwork is never-ending! I still walk around with three different file folders filled with different documents -- however, my list is getting shorter. You are doing an amazing job!


 Daddy'sgirls -- just checking in to see how you are doing. Thinking about you!


 Smurfy -- you are an amazing person and it's wonderful the things you have done to take care of your family. As we say on the UC forum, every one is different, and I suppose in these cases it's the same thing. Take care, and sorry for all of your losses...thinking about you."
Mom no longer wants to live,"Mom is 90, diagnosed with AD over 8 years ago. She remains in moderate stage with the use of Namenda and Aricept and lives in assisted living. I have two sisters and between the three of us, one of us is there every day to help her. We put her nightgown out on her bed, and lay out a fresh outfit with underwear for the next day. She has been doing okay and for a long time now, she has told us she is happy and feels safe where she lives. Until yesterday...now she has begun saying things like ""I have a miserable life"" or ""I don't want to live any longer. I keep telling ""him"" but he doesn't listen to me."" Tonight she told me she wants to be with my father, who died over 47 years ago. Needless to say, this makes me very sad. Now I realize that with dementia, their thoughts leave them almost immediately and this probably bothers me more than it does her. I am just wondering if anyone else here has had to deal with this? I battle depression and anxiety along with fibromyalgia and hearing this certainly doesn't help me in my battle to lift my spirits. Any input would be appreciated, thanks Miriam","My grandmother was doing the same thing. She would tell me that she wanted me to put her to sleep, like one would do for a dog but I had to keep telling her that I couldn't do that. She lost her will to live and it broke my heart tremendously. I can not tell you how many times I would sit in the car after visiting with her and cry. She eventually started doing things to herself. She had a nephrostomy bag due to bladder cancer and she would purposely cut the tubing. I had to take her in for emergency surgery twice for that. We also had to remove all scissors and nail clippers from her room. And finally she just pulled the whole thing out - there was a hole in her back where the tube was place and that tube went into her kidney. The tubing was stitched to her skin. I know it must of hurt like crazy but she was bound and determined to join gpa. That is what finally gave her her wish. :(


 That's a tough situation. I remember when I was a child, I had a grandpa who was paralyzed and he didn't want to live. He would ask my sister and I to kill him or roll his chair off a hillside. I agree on the antidepressants but I also think people should be able to choose the time when they are ready. Poor thing. You're wonderful for showing her so much love. I understand her perspective as well and I am not sure whether it is the dementia speaking or if maybe she really knows what she wants. I can tell you I wouldn't have wanted to live like my grandpa. I would have helped him if I could have.


 Gosh Miriam, I don't know. That is such a difficult decision and I wish I could give advice but I have never been there. My parents are still relatively healthy and I am very thankful for that. I am scared for the day when I have to make these decisions. I do know my mother well and I think I would do my best to follow her wishes as best I could. It's just really difficult to watch someone deteriorate when you feel like you could be doing something to prevent this from happening. It would almost be easier if you could choose the time and prevent the inevitable period of suffering. With my grandpa, he lived many, many years beyond desiring to pass. He was alone in a vet hospital fairly distant from all relatives. He did get visits from the family on a weekly basis. He was depressed and miserable. I don't think he would roll back the clock to relive those years. That's for sure! I am sorry you're going through this.


 As hard as it may be to face, your mother is 90 and at the end stage of life anyway. But she is not in her right mind to make these sort of decisions and that is where you come in. It's a really tough call on how you want to proceed but what if by taking her off the medications that it does not make her progress? AD is unpredictable. Right now it's about the quality of life - sort of like a terminal cancer patient; a cancer patient may or may not get better with treatment but in the process of trying it can be miserable. My heart goes out to you in this, it truly does.


 Oh, yes, MT Lady, all of us who have been caregivers know what you're talking about . Dementia (by strokes or by whatever means) leaves caregivers with feelings that are difficult to describe and share. Somehow, you have to learn that the lady whom you love so much is not the same person you knew as a youngster and that you must allow for any and almost all faulty judgments or statements that come from their mouths. They are really not aware of how others are affected by their comments. Try to realize each time you see her that you and your sisters are doing it all for God's blessings and that no matter what is said or done, your responsibility is to help them live the last days of their life with as much comfort and as little pain as possible and all in the name of the Heavenly Father. Be thankful for as much as you can see that resembles normalcy and know that your crown in heaven will be there for you when this is all part of the past. Try to accept what my personal doctor told me, ""we know that they're dying and that there's nothing we can do"". It's the most difficult thing I ever had to accept in my life. You probably feel the same way. My husband just said ""go there and do everything you can do"". Those are two wise statements that carried me through the years of my mother's strokes and eventual death. Take care of yourself. Try to allow plenty of time for yourself and for your own relaxation and interests, because caregiving is one exhausting and draining effort. You need your recovery time. You will, in the end, have the enduring positive feeling that you did all you could do; that will strengthen you immeasurably. Take care and may God bless you all.

 MT Lady, My gma recently passed over this last weekend. I was her sole caretaker for a year, she had dementia. I finally had to put her into a home because of my health, I couldnt take care of her without help, and the family didn't give me the help. Please know I am praying ofr you, I do understand your stressful situation, and with the fibro it is a key to remain unstressed I found for me personally. Depression often goes with dementia patients, and alz. Perhapy askign her primary doctor for a antidepressent?


 Thank you all for your responses and your wisdom. Mom has been on Lexapro since her diagnosis, which is an antidepressant. She also takes two medications at night to sleep and one is in the antidepressant class of drugs, so I don't think we could give her any more. She also takes Aricept and Namenda which her doctor tells us is slowing down the procession of Alzheimer's and that is what I'm struggling with. As her POA, do I take her off those medications, to allow her to progress through to end stage instead of keeping her stable in moderate stage? Miriam


 When you think about it her not wanting to live in her condition is not irrational, what is irrational is the thought that someone can help her achieve this. I just finished a book that described some elderly people in the 17th/18th century as longing to die when they were incapacitated and in pain but their religion prevented them from doing anything about it. They looked at death as a blessing both for them and their families. The book wasn't about this subject at all, it was just describing rural life in earlier times. Times haven't changed much at all have they? Luckily my parents and grandparents were never in this situation and I'm sorry your family and you having to deal with this.

LORAZEPAM/ ATIVAN??  1 MG.  WHAT TO DO??,"Mom has Alzheimer's pretty much last stages but she walks around and is in fairly good physical health. Her sleep habits are so erratic that we never get a night's sleep. Went to the neurologist today after 2 completely sleepless nights and he prescribed avitan. I checked this site and was scared by the results i saw posted. Can anyone tell me if this drug will help or does it make things worse.... Need to know BEFORE she starts taking it. (just as an aside, she is taking serroquel too and used to have ambien to sleep but it made her more confused!","DIDN'T HAVE TO USE IT YET. I'LL TRY TO GET ANOTHER MEDICAL OPINION. MY NEUROLOGIST CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. (GO FIGURE) ANYWAY, I HOPE I CAN HEAR FROM MORE OF YOU WHO MAY HAVE SOME SUCCESS STORIES ABOUT IT. THANKS.


 ALL RECOMMENDATIONS CONSIDERED!! ON HOW TO GET A NIGHT'S SLEEP.. WHAT MEDS WILL WORK? SERROQUEL? AVITAN? TYLENOL PM? AMBIEN? WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL?


 is that a tranquillizer or what category of drug is that and what is the doseage?


 I most heartedly agree with snowylynne.I use to be the owner/administator of a retirement /rest home and for the AD patients ativan(lorazepam) was a huge no no It does make them even more confused....Trazadone would be my choice i was also on that for awhile and it worked for me 100mg at bedtime ........hope you get some help.......like a doc that understands AD better and what not to rx them (my opinion) Take Care AND God Bless


 she's taking Seroquel and doesn't get to sleep? Wow... I took that stuff for two nights and had to quit because I slept forever. My mom takes Trazidone and says it's the best stuff ever. I'm currently on Sonata (my family has a lot of sleep issues... this is just my experience with them, but I don't know about how they work with AD, so maybe someone here can tell you that) and it works great. Snowy - thanks for the list of medications to stay away from. very helpful. :)


 Be careful about avitan, they gave it to my wife in the hospital, and it flipped her out. did the oposite of what it was supposed to. Hallucinations, etc. Haldol worked better. Hard to anticipate interactions with Alz meds and others. she is on basic alz meds as well as Trazadone at night. sometimes Seroquel during the day if she is anxious. Even doctors are not sure what to do for these patients.


 Ativan is not good for people with AD.It can cause agitation,anxiety.Do you have good relations with her Dr.If not get another Dr.you can talk to.That Dr.should know beter(guess not).It CAN make AD appear worst.


 Not all Neurologists know about AD,but they should. Medications for AD do work,but not in every person. TylenolPM has Benedryl in it another no,no for anyone with AD,or detrol,or other meds.for incontinemceXanax,Hadol,any of that type medication not the best,it canm make the person worse.If your Neuro.insists on giving any of these med.get a new Dr.


 Trazadone is good.It does work.


 Trazadone is an antidepressant.mg.range from 50 to 300 mg.I was on 75.mg & it worked good for me.I no longer take it,as I don't need it anymore.I'm sleeping good now.


 OPPS.I like to drink strawberry Margaritas,also White Zinfandel with my meals when we go out.My Dr.gave me the ok.


 I have AD Pixie,Seroquel is fine,but it's a antiphsychotic med.Trazadone is an antidepressant..............


 Ativan has a 90% ratio of making AD patients worse. Red this is from both medical training and personal experience"
Residential Care Or Institutional Care,"Currently, my Dad, per my observations is in stage 2 Alzheimers. We have had him in a lockdown ""MEMORY CARE"" wing of an assited living facility. There are 24 Alzheimers patients in the wing which is full occupancy, he shares a room with another Gentleman. My Dad seems to be going down hill fast in this environment, not eating enough, not sleeping enough, Etc. Everytime I visit him he will cry a lot and keeps telling me how bad it is and wants out, of course after I leave he doesn't remember that I have been there according to the caregivers. We are thinking of putting him in a residential home with 5 other folks not all of them have Alzheimers. As he is a wanderer, we are told he will have to be medicated to stay on the homes sleep schedule. He is 85 and I am his Son. I am torn on what would be best for him and would appreciate any thoughts on the subject that you may have. Al","i would check out the resident home---------visit the tenants! see how they are, see where it is, don't leap to the first alternative. talk to a social worker. w


 I've seen many residential care homes that only have a few people living in them, and they are quite nice. If you feel your father might be happier there, you might want to check some out. They do have a homier feel to them, and the one I visited had a vegetable garden and a lovey living area where folks could visit. I was very impressed. Plus I think they give a little bit more personal care since their are fewer people. You just never know -- some folks are better off in bigger environments with lots of people around and some are better off in a homier, small environment. Good luck to you and keep us posted; I know I'll soon be in the same predicament.


 This is a tough decision. I would say go with your heart. If you feel he would do better in a residential home, then go for it. Is he currently on sleep meds? The reason I ask is sometimes AZ patients do not do well on sedatives. They can actually work opposite then what they are intended and also it can make them agitated. How well do you know this assisted living center? Do they have any history of past abuse? Could he not be happy there because, even though many AL centers try to make it ""homey"", that it is too ""cold"" for him? Not personal enough? AZ patients have a tendency of taking every single nuance of others and make it personal. My Gma would insist that this one lady at the AL center didn't like her because she kept staring at my Gma. The girl kept staring because she was mentally handicapped. I wish you the best in whatever you decide to do. Like I said, it's a tough decision....


 I think your dad wants to stay at home. If he ever stays in your home, is there someone look after him? You may get licensed home health aide or nurse to supervise your dad. Have you asked the nurses there why he was acting that way? here are the following long term care facilities"
"Mom with Alzheimer’s, scratching face, ears and scalp","My Mom, who has moderate Alzheimers (diagnosed 3 years ago at age 81) began scratching her face, ears and scalp in the last couple of months and she can't seem to stop herself. It's causing a bacterial infection that has spread. Her GP gave her a prescript ion antibiotic cream, but the incessant scratching keeps it from doing it's job. When we discussed it with her Neurologist, he prescribed Zoloft. That has not helped at all. When we ask her not to scratch, she gets upset. I know she can't help it. We bought cotton gloves for her to wear, but she keeps losing them. Other than cutting her nails very short, does any one have any advice? I'm so afraid it could turn into a staph infection. Thanks for any advice!","Thank you. My Mom scratches constantly. SOmetimes, she will go to bed so she can scratch without being seen or noticed. But we haven't known what to do to distract her, other than holding her hand or asking her not to do it. I'll get some silly putty/play doh and see if that helps. Thanks again!


 WE've tried gloves, but not the velcro kind. Her neurologist called this morning and increased her Zoloft from 50 to 100 mg per day to see if that helps. THanks for your response. I really appreciate it!


 Hi. I usually post on the anxiety forum but the title of this post caught my eye and reminded me of something I saw recently. I hope you won't think I'm just butting in. I saw a show that had a little girl about 3 who was constantly scratching at her face and had all ready caused permanent scaring. The family was asked to try giving the girl one of those big soft make up brushes and a sponge. The brush she could lightly stroke her face so she still got that physical stimulation with out hurting her self and the sponge would keep the other hand busy. It took a little while to break the habit but the parents eventually got her to stop and her face healed up. I know it would be a bit different but it probably comes from a similar response to anxiety. best of luck


 Is she around people when she does this? Is she in a home or at home? It's tough to get an AD patient to stop a behavior and I totally understand your concern. If she is doing it when she is around people, perhaps distraction therapy may work. For example, when she starts scratching herself try to get her to do something else instead - my favorite is using odd materials to submerse the hands in (foam beads, silly putty, play-doh etc). They seem to enjoy the different textures. My Gma loved silly putty At night, short of restraint (which I am highly opposed to) there is not much that can be done than what you already are doing.


 Gloves? you can get a velco kind to make it more difficult to take off.


 I totally understand and empathize with you. My mom, who has Alzheimer's, takes her bridgework out. No, nothing wrong with the fit, we've had her at the dentist several times. She takes tops and bottoms out and if she's in her room well that's fine, but she does it at the dining room table, she's in assisted living and I don't know how the people at her table can stand it. One woman turns her chair away from my mom so she doesn't have to watch. When I'm there at meal time, I ask mom to not do it and she just ignores me. Sometimes I can ge t her to keep her hands in her lap so at least no one sees them. For many, many years, my mom use to knit and crochet and she stopped nine years ago, the same year she was diagnosed. I think she has simply forgotten how to do it. She also smoked at one time. I just wonder if this somehow pacifies her, something in her hands? I've tried to give her stuffed animals. I bought her a ""someone to care for"" baby doll from the Alzheimer's store...she wants no part of any of that. She has no interest in anything. Dementia is so, so, so difficult Miriam"
Coping with Mother-in-law,"HI, Sherry, et al. For a few years now we have been closely monitoring my MIL, who is showing increasing signs of AD. It has gotten to the point of hiring 24 hr. care for her. This is because of family dynamics that don't allow for any of her children to take this on full-time. All of her kids are older and are involved in business of their own, and have responsibilities with their extended families. She was recently taken to a memory clinic and the neurologist diagnosed her with moderate AD. He seemed to think that she would need institutional care within a year. She sometimes refuses to bathe, cannot recall if she has eaten or not, has gotten belligerent with the care-givers, cannot remember the names of her grandchildren, and has some notion that two of the sisters have already put her in a nursing home. She is still in the same house she has lived in for 40 years. She claims that the technology is there to duplicate her house, wall to wall. This one has us baffled, but I guess the neurosis was planted some time ago. It has gotten to the point that she started buying things for the ""other house."" We returned them and tried to convince her that we are trying to take care of her by keeping her in her own house and getting the girls to help her. Her response, ""Oh, that's what you want me to believe, but I know better. I was in the other house yesterday with (name of care-giver). You should come visit me there."" Whoa. I asked her where it was and she replied that she would drive me there. Sorry, no can do. We have removed the car keys, checkbook,(a niece is being documented for elder abuse as she ""borrowed ""$3000.00 in December. We think this all started about 4-5 years ago, when the confusion started becoming noticeable. My question is this. Are we looking at moderate AzD as opposed to senile dementia, or do we have a full-blown case on our hands? She had an MRI last week that we are awaiting the results of. What is the difference between mild,moderate and severe stages of the disease. Her outbursts have escalated to the point that the care-givers are calling us to diffuse the situations that come up when she gets angry. She's nearly totally deaf, so communication is difficult, if not frustrating because of all the yelling that has to be done. In the research we have done, we think she's headed for a NH sooner than one year. If anyone on this site has some input, then it's more than welcome. We'd love to get some additional insight as to what they think is going on in her brain. We understand that all cases are different, but what do you think we are truly looking at as far as professional full-time institutional care is concerned. In the meantime, I'll keep an eye on the ""other house"" wherever it is. By the way, I'm no strange to HW as I post at the Prostate Cancer forum. Not regularly, but I check in frequently. Thanks for the time. Bob","My mom was diagnosed with AD almost 8 years ago and was put on Namenda along with Aricept and she is doing extremely well. Her disease progression has been very slow. She lives in assisted living and needs assistance with dressing, showers, medication, but she is able to get to the dining room for her meals. She has no interest in being social, although there are daily activities. I think when we hear ""moderate"" we tend to think of someone who is not as far into the disease. These stages are very broad and can cover a period of years, depending on how quickly the person progresses. Once the person reaches end stage, they basically are not able to communicate any longer, lose the ability to walk and even sit up or feed themselves.


 I'm sorry that you guys are having to go through this. AD is such a difficult condition to have, not only to the person that has it but their loved ones as well. Mild AD - you might see signs of occasional forgetfulness or misplacing things. Forgetting where to go when you are driving at times. The emotions are still somewhat stable. You will still be able to live in your home and on your own. You know something isn't right but you can't place exactly what is going on. Or you think that it's a sign of getting older. Moderate AD - things have progressed to the point where you can not live on your own anymore and you need supervision. You forget names and places. You forget to eat and bathe. You lose the ""want"" of being out and with friends and family...become a social recluse. Emotions are getting unstable and you start to get a bit paranoid. Severe AD - This is the end stage. Your mind is gone. You don't know who you are. You become angry all the time or weepy. Eventually the body will shut down. Of course there are areas in between these stages. But the point is to start on medication as soon as the person knows or someone close to them knows to slow the progression. The progression can be fast or slow. The progression is unpredictable. Is your MIL on medication? If so what? Is she on a mood stablizer? My Gma was placed on Namenda to help control her emotions and it seemed to work for the most part. Btw, my Gma was also almost deaf and almost blind to boot so it was very tough on all of us when she lived with us. I made that decision to put her in an assisted living center after she was opening doors at night and hallucinating. There is a lot of things that do not make sense when it comes to dealing with AD. Their memories are a jumbled mess so what they are talking about may of happened many years ago but they jumble up the memory with something recent. It does indeed sound like AD unfortunately. And whether or not to put her in a home is up to the discretion of the care providers. If it becomes to dangerous for the in home workers or she becomes a danger to herself, you may not have any choice but to put her in a home. I really don't like the idea of putting a loved one in a home but sometimes there is no other choice. I feel they do better at home but you have to think of their welfare and of others at the same time. It's a tough call.


 Ladies, thank you for your replies. My MIL is diabetic, but has not been proactive in treating it. She is on a drug regimen to treat the diabetes, as well as Selexa for mood elevation. I don't think this is working as well as something else might, as she is angry most of the time, as well as depressed. She goes back to the neurologist on May 9th and we'lll go from there. Will let you know what the next step will be. Thanks again. Bob"
AD and dental work,"Anyone here have experience with this? My mom is 89 years old and is living in assisted living. I received a call last night from her CNA stating that one of mom's bridges, a stationary one, broke out of her mouth. I was able to make her an appt at a dentist near where she lives. Bottom line, there is decay which caused the bridge to break and we are now thinking the best opiton would be to pull the remaining four teeth she has and just put in a bottom plate of false teeth. The problem is that she would be without teeth on the bottom for about 6 weeks to two months while the gum is healing from the teeth extraction. I'm just wondering how mom will handle all this and if there is any other option? She is really not happy at all about this and keeps telling me to forget it, that she will just deal with what she has, which really is not an option, but...go argue with someone with AD... just wondering if anyone else here has any suggestions? Thanks Miriam","Is her mouth hurting her? If not, it might be wise just to wait and see how things develop. Going to the dentist is traumatic for some people and especially with someone with AD it can make things even scarier. If it gets to the point where her mouth is hurting her or it gets infected, then it might be time to consider the options which is usually not that favorable. Meaning sedation for the extractions. People with AD do not respond well to sedation in most forms. Before my Gma really started declining, I took her to the dentist but the dentist gave her a very small dose of Valium to help calm her. But if your mom is very adamant about not going, you may not have much choice other then to get her on antibiotics if it becomes infected. Sometimes it's about picking your battles.


 For my grandmother, we tell her when its time for dental appts that the denture is going to be fixed by a doctor so she doesnt have to have pain while wearing them. And then she usually quipps she doesnt remember complaining about them, and we just say, ""oh you've mentioned it a few times. maybe your forgetters are working overtime."" We make it kind of ""fun"" as you can tell. After the appointment we always take her to a restraunt so she associates with going to doctors, dentists gets a big treat to restraunt hehe. *Whispers* We also tricked her into thinking she doesn't smoke anymore and quit years ago. Sometimes, this Dementia and Alheimers can be a plus LOL!


 Thanks for your suggestions. My mom does not enjoy going out to eat any more...she is very insecure and just wants to be in her room...rarely even leaves her room, except for meals where she goes to a dining room and thankfully she is still able to do that. Can't really bribe her with anything any more...I wish I could. I was told once by a Social Worker that it is okay to tell ""Alzheimer's lies""...just twist the truth a bit, step into their world and try to make things easier for us and them. Just a very tough road to travel. If I try to make light of things, she tells me I am being ridiculous. If I try to be stern and ""take over"" she resents it and tells me not to tell her what to do. She has always been an extremely stubborn woman so it's difficult. Thanks again Miriam


 She enjoys her daughters spending time with her. I have two sisters, one that works at the facility, evening shift, so she is there to ""tuck"" mom in at night and my other sister and I switch off spending some time with her during the day. The ONLY thing she will do is go to bingo which is twice a week for about an hour. I learned today that she went to a wine and cheese social they had. She refuses to leave the facility. If she does leave, she is totally confused and returns in a horrible state. She has no other interests at all. She use to crochet, knit, volunteered, had friends. She gave everything up about 7 years ago. She is a stubborn as the day is long and you cannot convince her to do a thing. She lays in bed most of the day and listens to the TV -- that is it -- the CNAs and social director knock on her door and tell her what activity is going on, but she refuses to leave her room.


 My mom won't allow the dentist to remove her bridge to get at the decay in a crown and underneath. She has very few teeth left and I know she will lose the ones she has, before long - and THEN what! It is very upsetting to me, but what can I do? It is what it is. She has neglected her teeth for years - we didn't realize this because she was living on her own and we didn't realize she had AD. I think she would just have teeth pulled instead of having them treated. Now her mouth is a mess... She is convinced that my dentist pulled 11 of her teeth on the last visit, when in reality, she has had them pulled over the years when she was living far away from where I live (I have moved her into a retirement community near me, now). She lives in a retirement community where they serve two meals a day and offer little trips and activities. She is going out less and less on the little trips to the store, etc... I think it is because she can't cope. She complains of being cooped up, but she won't go out. When I take her out, she gets totally confused about where she lives - and asks me where she is going to sleep. So, I think the structure of where she lives is helpful - and I have to not worry about her complaining about being cooped up, because she really can't handle going out much, anymore.


 MT Lady, my Gma used to do that too. When she lived out of state, she would say she missed everyone and she was lonely. Then her husband (my Gpa) passed away and we moved her in with us and she still said she was lonely. It made me feel bad, like I somehow failed her but I realized that it was the dementia talking after a while. My Gma was also a recluse eventually. She preferred to stay in her room even after the aids at the assisted living center kept trying to get her involved in things. Every Sunday they had choir singers and church services. She used to tell me how lovely they sang but she never left her room to go see them - she preferred to stay in her room. I would take her out once or twice a week for lunch or shopping; just to get her out of her room. But then she fell and broke her hip, was placed in a wheel chair. So her during her last days, when I would go visit her she would be in the game room just staring out the window. I guess she didn't have much say on where they wheeled her. :) But I was glad to see her out of her room.


 If she really fights you hard on this & with others forget it.At 89 with dementia it can be a problem for everyone concerned,esp.her..........


 Is the dentist really advocating this, given the situation? I would find out how much pain she is in and if there is a way to manage it versus going the tooth removal route.


 LOL Smurfy! :)


 What does she like doing? Walks in Park? Visiting some family memeber? Seeing an old friend?


 Bring the activity to her. Like her daughters with cookies and coffee.. or you guys doing a make over for fun on her and letting her do one on you. maybe reading to her. She watches tv, maybe you can get her out with a movie? As for dental work, find a dentist that would be willing to come to the facility. Some will still do house calls.


 Cris, I COMPLETELY understand what you are saying. My mom is exactly the same and from what I have learned about Alzheimer's, it is not uncommon for the person to become very insecure. Thankfully my mom feels very safe and secure where she is living and loves her little room. Like your mom, they have activities throughout the day and for the most part, my mom refuses most of them. Yes it is a shame, but the bottom line is what makes her happy and if she prefers to be in her room, then so be it. But, like you, I get phone calls telling me she is lonely. In reality, what would make her happiest if either me or my other two sisters were with her throughout the day and that is simply not possible.We all still work full time. We are doing our best by visiting at least 2 to 3 times a week. I have to tell myself it is the disease, but it does frustrate me. On the one hand, she has all these lovely activities she could be doing all day long but she chooses to stay in her room, and on the other hand, I get phone calls telling me how lonely she is. Very frustrating.


 My mom's been in this assisted living facility for almost two years and at first, my sister made it her ""mission"" to see that my mom got involved in actitivites. It took her many months to finally realize it's not what makes us happy, we have to see things through their eyes. The disease causes so much insecurity. I can't even imagine what she goes through. You see, my mom is very aware of her memory loss, which I think makes it even worse. She talks about it to me, how she's forgotten everything. Makes me feel so bad. In any case, I do still call her and tell her what activities are planned, even though the social director knocks on her door to remind her. Sometimes I think maybe if she hears it from her daughter, it might spark something? I try, but I don't force her, and if she says no, then I say ok, just wanted you to be aware. It's all we can do take care Miriam"
Advice for mother's care,"She's 95 and in good health for her age, but within the last 6 months her Alzheimer's has progressed to the point that she doesn't always recognize me, she can't walk on her own, she needs diapers, needs to be fed, etc. She's better in the mornings, but in the evening she gets very anxious and putting her to bed is a nightmare, lots of insomnia, bed shaking, etc. So far she lives in her home with paid caregivers during the day and a family member at night. We got a doc who put her on Lorazapam for sleep and Galanamine for the Az. So far neither med seems to be doing much good but she's only been on them a few days. The question is, is it best for her to remain at her own home or go to a nursing home? When her mind was sane she told me she wanted to be in a home when she was older, but now she actively fights any suggestion that she go to a home. I've also heard that in homes they deteriorate quickly and are not cared for well. However, in her own home it's not so easy either. She has to be watched constantly because she wants to stand up from her chair and could fall down -- she's already fallen twice. And all she does is sleep at night or sit in her chair and watch TV. Maybe a home would giver her mover variety. However, just when I'm thinking she would be better off in a home, she seems to perk up and get better. But then at night she reverts back. Plus, and this is not the key issue, but it's extremely expensive to provide private care for 16 hours a day in her home, as compared with an elderly home. Having a live-in family member day and night is not feasible. I know it's our decision, and it's a tough one, but wondering if anyone has any advice, or has gone through this and what their experience is. Thanks in advance.","Thanks for the reply, Sherry. I feel clearer in my thinking about the situation just from posting that. Today I again saw her gradually lose her reasoning abilities and get into the sundown problem. It's sad to see someone who wants to communicate but can't. At one time she told me that she can't say the words she wants. So we said an Our Father and she found those words to say. But just when I think she might start being her old self, she begins acting nonsensical. She'll want to stand, I tell her she can't do it on her own but to ask me if she needs help. She agrees, then a minute later begins to stand. I feel like I'm talking to a blank wall. So I help her to stand, ask her where she wants to walk to, and she tells me she doesn't want to go anywhere. So I ask her if she wants to sit, and she does. This was my day for 3, 4, 5 hours in the daytime. Then at night as soon as she goes down she begins shaking the bed wanting to get up. She's on sleep mess now which seem to be helping a bit, but in the morning she now begins shaking the bed and removing her diapers. I now realize she is more than I can handle. She needs professional help, so the problem will be how to move her to a nursing home in the midst of her protests. I'm a bit hopeful in that today she told me that material things are less important tom her now, and she wants to go to her home. I don't know if she meant that she didnt think she was in her home, or if she was ready for heaven. What hurts is knowing this lady had a sharp mind her whole life, and took care of several family members in her home until they passed away. But they didn't have altzheimer's. The more I learn about this illness I realize just how awful it is. Thanks for listening /reading.


 When my mother feels insecure, she will say ""I want to go home""...there is a LOT of insecurity that goes along with AD. They are very confused. After 7 years of watching my mom go through her AD journey, she is now in assisted living. In order to keep her there and not go into a nursing home, we, me and my two sisters, are constantly there to help out. Mom doesn't wear diapers, but does have pads in her underwear because she occasionally does have accidents, or simply isn't cleaning herself well. We are there every night to be sure she changes her underwear and we wash her bottom. This isn't required in assisted living, so we make sure we are there to help. We pick up her clothes, help her get into her nightgown, and put out fresh clothes for the next day because otherwise my mother would wear the same thing over and over. I am not trying to talk you out of assisted living, just helping you to understand the level of care. My mother is in a 5 star facility, the top rating there is and one of my sisters is a registered nurse and works there, from 3 to 11, although she works on another floor. You just have to realize that once your parent is placed, the work is not done. It is obvious how much you love your mom and want the best for her. I wish you well Miriam


 You might want to consider a med adjustment. I am only suggesting this, because I know from (sorry mods) medical training AND personel experience that Ativan can actually make the person worse with elderly and esp ppl with Alheimers. My grandmother was way worse on it. After her recent attack, where I was actually being beaten, and strangled, I had to render 911 for aid. I declared Alheimers so police would not hurt her. Lucky me, she tried to attack me again, but the police officer (one of them) took a few blows (LoL) for me. It was determined she needed a med adjustment and was sent to the hospital where she attacked more people (notice a theme lol) and landed in the physc ward and undergoing a med adjustment. Seriously, they figured out the Lorazepam (generic is Ativan) was the thing doing this to her. So you really might consider asking for your LO to be admitted to undergo some med adjustments


 I don't think you can say, across the board, what medications are bad or good. My mom's physician heads up a memory loss/alzheimer's medical center and he is a geriatrician. He has prescribed lorazapam for my mom, for anxiety and agitation with no problems. I think a physician that sees hundreds of patients with dementia has a pretty good grasp on what meds work well. I'm glad for you, Reachout, that you were able to come to a decision along with your family, for her. Sounds like you have picked a fine facility. If it is at all possible, try to go and see her often, whether it is you or someone in the family. Bottom line, it is the residents that have family involved that end up getting the best care. This is from my personal experience, from other friends as well, and my sister is an RN at a facility. I wish you all well


 I'm sorry that it had to come to that, having to send her to a home. But keep in mind, even though part of her may not remember you, she is still there in some aspect. This does sound like a good facility. But like Mt Lady said, remember to go visit her often. Especially during the transitioning stage. Best wishes.


 We put her in the home today. This was the worst day of my life. It wasn't the move, in fact, she no longer thinks much about being in her own home. The problem is the AZ. She didn't want to go anywhere, didn't even want to get up from her chair. So it was a struggle all the way to get her up, dressed, out the door, in the car, with her struggling and resisting all the way. Keep in mind she's 95, but her strength is very good when she wants to grab something, pinch, or bite. Took her to the home with her moaning all the time. As soon as we got to the home and took her inside she calmed down and was actually in a good mood. The doctor checked her out, and except for the AZ she was in good shape. She took a memory test and failed pretty miserably. The doc said she has moderate to severe AZ and will change her meds. She was OK the rest of the day, ate well, and was fine until the dreaded sundown syndrome kicked in around 4. She then started fighting to get out of her wheelchair, with little thought about her falling, scraping on the metal parts, etc. Had to restrain her with a little vest made for that purpose, then watch as she sat there struggling against the vest and moaning the whole time. The staff finally took her in to put her to bed but I could not take any more and we left her to the care of the staff. I have no idea how she will spend the night, or if she will fall in the middle of the night and hurt herself again. I never thought AZ would be like this. I thought it was just forgetting things, losing memory, and peaceful in a way, because the person would not remember anything bad. But it's just the opposite in my mother's case. Not only can she not remember anyone, but she doesn't even know enough to keep from hurting herself or others, and she acts like she's trapped. I am completely out of resources now, I have no idea what to do other than to leave her to the professional care of the staff and to trust that God knows best.


 My heart aches for you too. I know it must have been hard to leave her, but those folks are experts in their field. I used to work for a group of care homes, and one of them was an Alzheimer's facility. They were very caring people and had a remarkable program set up. Hang in there and take care.


 Well that's awesome! I am so glad your mother is adjusting to her new home. I hope she has many more of these good days. I'm sure it makes you feel better knowing you did the right thing.


 Well, it's been a week and so far, so good. Between us an other family members we've seen her every day. She seems to be adapting to the nursing home as well or better than she did to her own home. Her AZ is so advanced that, in reality, she doesn't really know where she is. She eats well, but is only slightly conversant, and mainly in the morning. Her sundown problem begins earlier now, around 4, after she eats. She gets tired, begins constant moaning, and can't communicate. There are little things that are the most stressful for us. She won't let anyone put her teeth in or take them out, and even the nursing staff has decided to leave them in for now. I don't know what will happen in the long term if they are not taken out and washed, or maybe there is a sedative that will allow us to take them out. Last night I helped a staff member put her to bed, which involves picking her up out of the wheelchair and laying her down. The way she reacted you would thinkk we were torturing her. She acts that way even if I recline her wheelchair or, sometimes, even if I wheel her around so I know it's just that sundown thing. These little things are the most stressful to me. By the time I get home I'm emotionally drained.


 Just a quick update. A few days after my last post she developed pneumonia and a failing heart and had to be rushed to the hospital. We signed DNR orders and were ready for the end but, almost miraculously, she pulled through with the help of a competent hospital staff, oxygen therapy, and IV antibiotics. She's back in the nursing home now and, other than her AZ, is looking pretty good. Her doctor put her on Aricept, and she is much calmer now. She recognizes family even though she can't say many words. The home lost her glasses, so that was a mini-issue looking for an optician with a kind heart who made her a set even though it was an older prescript ion and she wasn't there to be fitted. All in all, the NH was the best decision for her we've evern made. It allows us to rest knowing she's in good hands, and we get to visit her whenever we want. Thanks again for your support on this board.


 That's a tough decision to make and it's not an easy one that is for sure. Only you and your family can make that decision like you said. If you want to place her in a home, be sure to do your homework. Research it online and ask for recommendations from her doctor. You want a home that has no history of abuse or neglect. When I had to make that decision for my Gma, I chose an assisted living center over a nursing home. She was still able to walk, eat on her own and tend to her bathroom needs even if she was blind. So I asked her doctor where he recommended and he gave me a name of a place that he himself visited to tend to the needs of his patients. Privately owned assisted living centers can be expensive as well as the hired care takers. When someone has AZ, they can lose their circadium rhythm. Basically they get their days and nights mixed up. Nor do they sleep that much. When they get agitated or more confused at night, that is Sundowner's syndrome. alzheimers.aplaceformom.com/articles/sundowners-syndrome/ I wish you the best and know that I have been there as well. It is really a tough, tough decision to make.


 I know this condition is such a horrible thing to have because it affects not only the person who has it but their loved ones as well. My Gma would also tell me she was tired and she wanted to join Gpa in heaven. She passed away a year ago at the age of 90, she got her wish. She was my rock as I was growing up and she was always there for me when I needed her. I am still grieving for her but I am happy at the same time because she is no longer suffering. My Gma would get majorly confused and talk nonsense but one time she asked me to give her a shot to put her to sleep (like how you put a dog down). I had to tell her that I can't do that because I would get arrested! :) She was also at a loss for words and had a hard time making conversations. I think that is probably the hardest thing to cope with along with the confusion. Your mother may protest and not want to go to a home, but you have to think of her best interest as well as your own. I think that as long as you and other family members keep an eye on the situation at the home, go visit frequently or take her for outings (if you can) that it can help with the transition along with knowing she is still loved.


 I also have a Grandmother age 80 that was just recently diagnosed with Advanced Dementia/Sundown Syndrome and hers is progressing quickly however she still knows us she just sees people we don't and swears she eats and she doesn't.She now lives in a assisted living nursing home and is in the ""Locked""unit for Alzheimer's Patients.She is not happy there but she gets great care there are fewer patients and more nurses for the patients on this hall.They take them to the doctor and have many activities for them to do and a separate dining room.This is the best place for her and affordable they take her social security check.It is a hard decision to make and My Mother&Brothers had a hard time making it and one morning i got a call at 6 am that she was outside screaming someone was trying to kill her(it was the ""men""she was seeing that weren't there so needless to say we got her to the Emergency Room and The doctor made that decision for her that she would never go home again.So check out Assisted living places with locked floors for Alzheimers Patients,Hope that helps and Good luck!


 Thanks to everyone for your kind suggestions and advice. We finally made the decision, as a family, that a nursing home can care for her AZ much better than we can at her home. She is beginning to get agressive and fight the at-home caregivers, causing her more injury. On a positive note, the Lorazapam seems to be helping her sleep while not being too tired and sleepy during the day. Tomorrow is the big day, and we are all going to the home with her. I told her that we are moving her to a temporary clinic that can give her medical treatment and physical therapy, which is sort of true. The home has doctors who make weekly rounds and physical therapists to work with them to make sure they maintain their strength and don't get bed sores. And the home is close to family, so we will be able to visit her even more often than we do now. If it doesn't work out, we'll go to Plan B or C or whatever. She shook her head that she didn't want to go, but didn't go on protesting, so I think deep inside she knows this will be best for her. Or maybe she just can't process that level of thought, especially since she really no longer knows who I am. I feel very much at peace about the decision. Thanks again, and I willl post after we've had enough experience to know how things are going.


 An interesting sidelight, I had prostate cancer a couple of years ago (hopefully cured), and did not tell the family (other than my wife of course) for fear it would get to my mother and upset her so much that she might not recover. Now that her AZ has progressed to the point that she doesn't recognize me, I finally had the freedom to tell my family.


 That's nice reachout, that everyone in your family made the decision to get the best care for your Mom. It's such a tough decision, but I think you are right that deep down she knows this is the best for her. The other day I was leaving my parent's house and my Mom said to me, ""My memory is going fast. If you ever have to put me in a home, all I ask is that you come and visit me."" I could barely hold back the tears. Take care, and I'm sending good thoughts your way.


 Unfortunately aggression is an all too real symptom of AZ. But hopefully with the change of medications, it will help calm her down. My heart just aches for you because I know what you are going thru. Hang in there, she is now in professional hands.


 I went to see her in her new home yesterday around noon, and she looked good! She seemed more alert , and I even wheeled her around the gardens outside. One of the nurses said she ate well, and told her she enjoyed being there! She also said she did not sleep well the night before, and I know she didn't, but the fact that she even remembered not sleeping well is a positive. They are also giving her massages and treating an infected scrape that she got while at home. It's only been two days, but I'm encouraged by seeing that they indeed can take better care of her than we could. Thanks again, everyone, and my heart and prayers go out to everyone here going through the same issues with your loved ones.


 What excellent news! I'm so glad that the home is working out for all of you! Sounds like a wonderful place, and she is getting A-1 treatment. Peace of mind for all of you too!


 Her dentures need to come out, at least as much as possible. If left in too long, food particles can get stuck in there, possibly causing infections or sores not to mention that it will give her awful breath. Does she have a good time of the day where she seems more with it? Perhaps, that might be the time to take them out and clean them or if she can understand, have her take them out herself.


 I'm sorry that your mother had to go thru that and you as well. But I'm glad she made a turn around."
"New to caregiving, but not HW -- any basic tips?","I'm usually over on the Crohn's board, but have recently taken over care of my Mom. My Dad just passed away and we know she has dementia. We're not sure the severity because she obviously had a lot of stress going on with my Dad's illness and her illness took a back seat for some time. She's going to be living the majority of the time at my house. I have a toddler and a baby and work part-time. Any basic tips for beginning diagnosis and treatment or dealing with dementia day by day will be hugely appreciated.","Wow, thank you Sherry. She's not a wanderer yet, but we're afraid to leave her alone. I hired a woman to come when I have to take the kids on outings she can't handle. She does not remember to eat on her own, that's one of the biggest reasons we won't leave her alone and had her move here. She was very disoriented and anxious about the move here. I've learned to be much more patient in the last couple weeks, but with two needy kids I sometimes just have to tell her to wait her turn. I guess that's a bit like the distracting techniques. I do have all of the power of attorney taken care of at least. I'll check out bracelets next. We're on the wait list for a major memory clinic here. Hopefully we can get her in soon.


 My condolences to you and your family. First, you need to have someone in your family assigned as her Power of Attorney and Durable Power of Attorney for health care. With that in place, you or whoever will be able to take charge of her care. When that is in place (or if it already is), you should have her evaluated to find out the extent of her dementia. From there you can decide on how to proceed. For instance, if she is left alone for any period of time but lucid enough so she doesn't wander, you might want to remove the knobs from the stove so she doesn't try to cook. If she is a wanderer, you might need to place her in adult daycare or have someone come sit with her when someone is not home with her. Also too, it wouldn't hurt to have an ID chain placed on her - either a bracelet or necklace. I personally like the tamper proof bracelets. People with dementia also have a hard time remembering when to eat or if they have already eaten. So it's important to have her partake in meals with you so she will get the proper nutrition. When you take someone with dementia out of familiar surroundings, there might be some confusion at first. She may get more agitated and confused but patience is the key. Do not lose patience with her if she keeps asking the same question over and over. Having someone move in with you with dementia, it's pretty much like having another child. If you should have more questions, do not hesitate to ask.


 I understand what it's like to be a caregiver with small children. My kids were a bit older then yours but I had to go thru the same thing. I know what it's like to be torn in two or three different directions - between the kids, the husband and then there was my grandmother. It takes a lot of patience and dedication to be a caregiver. I applaud anyone who is willing to take on the that role. I just want you to know that we are here for you for questions, concerns or if you just want to vent okay?"
Congestive Heart Failure,again my partner is fighting something that is trying to take her life......is the alzheimer's itself not enough? i hope she understands me when i tell her how very sorry i am that she is suffering....she didn't want this how do i know when enough is enough? what do i do now?,"Oh hun, I can feel your fear, confusion, anger and grief! I am so sorry to hear that your partner is in CHF. :( It seems when we accept one thing, another comes along to knock us down a notch or two.


 Lynnie, I am very sorry to hear what your partner and you are going through tat this time. My heart goes out to both of you. Lynnie, a few days ago, you posted on the chronic pain forum about someone you called Maddie and it was on a members post named Buttercup. You indicated some problems with this person on another forum. I am a moderator on the chronic pain forum and I would very much like to visit with you about this person. If you get a moment would you mind emailing me about this, my email is listed in my profile here at the forum. Please take care of yourself. Straydog


 i wish i had never heard the word alzheimers...... i wish i had spent more time with her instead of letting life take me away..... i wish she was not suffering and struggling to live a life she does not want, lost inside herself..... God please don't let her be feeling fear... i wish it did not come to this........


 i just count her breaths now......."
Whether to tell truth,"My mother-in-law is 89. She moved in with us 2 years ago when she became unable to care for herself. She has very bad osteoporosis, with lots of trouble walking, and alzheimers. After she had lived with us a couple of months, her house burned, not to the ground, but it is totally unlivable. Afterwards, she asked about her house about once a day. We told her the truth each time which always led to many more questions. And then we start with, I hate to be a burden on ya'll, with which she goes on and on, and then grieves for quite awhile. Now, 2 years later, she starts asking about her house continuously. It has become very depressing. I know she can't help it, but it is still hard to contend with when it dominates conversations. After all this time of telling her the truth and having to deal with the consequences, would it be okay to tell her that her house is fine, but she is unable to live by herself. Do you think it would help? We are so new to all this. Thanks for any help.","I used to tell little white lies to my Gma all the time. Because every time they find something out, it's like a scab that has been peeled off every time - it hurts them mentally. My Gma moved in with me and was mentally fine but then she developed AD. There were a quite a few times that I told her that she was visiting us while her trailer was being painted. in reality, her trailer was 800 miles away, sold and her husband (my Gpa) had passed away. She was already an emotional wreck half the time I saw no need to add to it.


 I was just discussing this subject with someone last night. For some reason, the person seems to dwell on one thing but can totally forget everything else. I too tell little white lies because as the above posters mentioned, because I figure why add to their frustration. I took over my parents finances and my Mom is always talking about how she can't forget to pay the bills. I just tell her not to worry because I'll help her with them. She tells me she will help me find the checkbooks, and I tell her, ""That's great, we'll find them when we need them."" Then she'll let it go for awhile. Then we'll go through the same scenario again. But, this was her biggest job and she took great care to make sure everything was in financial order. I know it's not as ""big"" of a situation as what you are dealing with, but there's many more stories like that!


 The same topics dominate my mom's conversations, too. She doesn't remember what we have already told her... everyday, every SENTENCE is like starting over... so don't worry about saying whatever you have to, to keep her calm and happy. She won't remember... Only we get upset because it is so repetitive.


 Hi AUponder, I think it is better you take a professional's counsel on this it sounds acute and dangers in it...even if u do it rightly.


 I COMPLETELY agree with Sherry...no harm in telling her little white lies. Why continue to cause her pain, and so much stress on yourselves? What purpose does it serve? My mom has Alz, she is 89 years old and lives in assisted living. I call her every night to say good night and every night she asks ""will I see you tomorrow?"" and every night I say ""of course, I will be there""... I do go at least twice a week, sometimes more, but it makes her happy to think her daughter is coming the next day. She never, ever remembers. It just gives her a good feeling as she is falling asleep. What's the harm? None. be well Miriam


 Thank you all for the help. It may have happened too long ago, and we've told her the truth everytime, for it to work. But, I think I'll tell her everything is fine at home. Thanks


 I agree with the responses above, and would like to add that in my PCA course it is suggested that disturbing subjects/answered be avoided and to try to understand the emotion behind the question. For example, maybe you two can enjoy talking about how nice her house is focusing on her positive emotion, then add in lies as needed to not upset her. The woman I care for brings up her husband every once in a while (he passed away three decades ago). If she asks about him I just tell her he's on a business trip and will call tomorrow etc. However, the woman I care for has pretty much zero short term memory, so this wouldn't be appropriate for some people). It is hard for me because I am a very truthful person, but I have seen the effect of telling the truth and it causes more harm than good. My take on it is that Alzheimer's creates a reality vastly different from the one most of us know. There is no reason to drag people into a reality that no longer exists to them. My goal with my patient is to promote peace and enjoyment as much as possible in her last years."
Magnesium supplement to help Memory?,"Based on a study done last year looks like they found that more magnesium in the brain helps with short term and long term memory.

alzheimer's for ten years and in a nursing home,"Dear Friends, I have written before several times on this forum but It has been quite awhile ago. It was about ten years ago when mother began having symtoms of alzheimer's. She is in a nursing home now and in a wheelchair. She can no longer help lift herself up to go to the bathroom, so someone has to support all of her weight and it takes two people to put her on the commode and put her to bed. My brother goes during the day and I go in the evening and feed her supper and stay until after she is in bed for the night. She sleeps all of the time unless she is taken down for meals or to have a bath. She cannot talk anymore but tries at times but we can't understand her. I know this must be very frustrating for her. She doesn't know who we are anymore. Her face used to light up with my brother or I would walk in, but not anymore and for the last six weeks, she sits with her head down which she never used to do. I know she is in the final stage of alzheimer's and I hope the Lord takes her before she is completely bedridden. My brother has told me how terrible the final stage of alzheimer's in. Mother is 86. It's very hard to see her like this. She was always such an indenpendent person and worked all of her life.

 Hi there from what they think with mom n dad passing away howie leaving and just other issues as well i just basically blew a gasket i will never get hearing back hun its gone but thanks for your kind thoughts blessings lyn


 Dear Lyn, What a trooper you are :-) My brother who is a vietnam vet developed a form of maculer degeneration in his late twenties. Eye specialists from all over the United States have come to the veteran's hospital to check out his eyes and they still don't know exactly what he has. He worked as long as he could and then he drove as long as he could. Then, he moved in with mother and lived with her for over twenty years. He is the one who took care of her for about six or seven years before she went into the nursing home. But he never complains. You remind me of him. 'Did you have to learn sign language? Wiggyann


 Dear Lyn, I just wanted to say that I hope the sign language will be easy for you to learn :-) I watched a movie last year, ""The Family Stone"" and one of the young men in the family was deaf and all during the movie, members of the family signed to him when someone else was talking. That was the first time I have ever seen anything like that in a movie and it really touched me. The movie is a comedy. Wiggyann


 So sorry to hear of your pain. I hope that you are able to find some peace. (((hugs))) Stacey


 :-) Thank you Stacey and Lyn for your conforting words. Lyn, I'm so very sorry you had to go through what you did, but am happy to hear that you have regained your memory.

PET Scan for Neuroimaging,"Can anyone give some details about the procedure of PET scan for neuroimaging?

My mother in law,"I am new here but not to HW. My mother in law is an amazing person!!! I love her dearly. She is 88 and lives independently. Over the last year I have seen a lot of short term memory loss. It started with names. She is very aware of this. ""Oh I just can't remember her name!!!! You know, that nice lady that used to live next to you......."" Now she is starting to repeat herself. She comes over a couple times of week to help out. She is sort of a hyper person and she loves doing our laundry! Now after she leaves we all go through our ""new"" clothes and exhange. I frequently have my 16 year old's t-shirts in my closet and he will have my jeans etc. We laugh it off and so appreciate all she does for us. I have pointed out her memory problems and suggested she see a doctor. She gets angry and says that all old people have short term memory problems. My dad has early alzheimers and is doing really well. Despite this, I don't know much about alzheimers. (he and I compare MRIs and giggle) Should I be pushing for a neuro check for ""grandma ruth""? Would it just be better to not pester her about this. Part of the reason she doesn't want to see a neuro is she is VERY claustrophobic and won't even think about an MRI........not even an "" open"" MRI. At 88 I certainly don't expect complete and intact memory and cognition.......I just don't know how hard to push. What do you think? Thanks for any advice you can give.","When was the last time she had a complete check up?


 Thank you everyone. I have told her she can say no to an MRI. I have no idea if her memory problems are or are not part of normal aging. She sees a GP regularly and he has never said anything. She does repeat herself in a conversation. Yesterday I again asked her about seeing a neurologist just for a check, she agreed yesterday but getting her to actually go may be tough. It's a step in the right direction however! Thanks for your advice.


 Hello Gretchen, I am so glad to see you online. This is not my expertise but my MIL is also very forgetful so I have been keeping an eye on her. Here are a few tips that may help you in deciding if you should keep encouraging your MIL to see her physician. My MIL is 85 years old but she has been forgetful for years so I just watch for changes. Memory problems that aren't part of normal aging: Forgetting things much more often than you used to Forgetting how to do things you've done many times before Trouble learning new things Repeating phrases or stories in the same conversation Trouble making choices or handling money Not being able to keep track of what happens each day Wishing you the best and I miss you ! Gentle Hugs, Kitt


 It sounds like how my Gma was before she started declining. She would forget peoples names, had a horrible time with the laundry (she would put soap in the softener section and no soap), she started repeating things over and over. She started to become paranoid, scared so she would hide her money in her room...we found almost $3000 hidden in her room when we finally had to move her to an assisted living center. Your MIL doesn't necessarily need a MRI to diagnose a dementia. Questions and behavorial tests alone can help determine that. Maybe you should ask her when was the last time she had a physical and when she goes in, offer to take her but ask her doc to possibly do a mental test as well (without her knowledge). When people start to lose their cognitive abilities, they tend to be in denial or scared. Of course all that she is going thru may very well be the fact of getting older. Heck, I can't even remember names and I'm only 40! But Kitt gave you some good things to look out for in case it isn't age related."
Can use some advice,"Hi, I am a chronnie and can usually be found on the crohns forum. I am posting this to see if I can get some advice on how to help my boyfriend with his mom. I will try to be short and not bore with details. I was having lunch with my boyfriend and his mom last November and then we took my niece to the park to play. I noticed thru lunch and at the park that she kept asking a lot of the same questions over and over which is not really like her. Also, keep in mind I have not seen her day in and day out for the last year as I have been going thru my own issues with my Dad passing away and being diagnosed with Crohns. Anyway, at Thanksgiving my boyfriends sister was upset that the mother forgot to take out the ham to thaw for dinner. I told my boyfriend my concerns based on the conversation I had with his mom and they decided to take her to a specialist. Also keep in mind that Alzheimers runs in the family on the mothers side. Dr said she was fine after some tests and an MRI. Basically said she had 'old brain'.Well yesterday my boyfriend calls me all upset that noone has heard from his mom since 10:00 am that morning. He can't come over and is going to go look for her. She was supposed to be going over to her sisters house. They finally tracked her down and literally she had been driving around lost for 8 hours! When they stopped her she was almost out of gas, had not eaten and they said she was very calm. She just said she forgot the names of streets and got lost. This does NOT sound like just a case of old brain to me To make matters even worse my boyfriend calls me today and says that he and his sister are going to a lawyer to get a power of attorney. Well, his mother is remarried and I tried to explain to him that they really needed to talk to the stepfather first. He currently has power of attorney and I can see a battle coming. I just feel they should not rush to take this away from the stepdad as he has never given any reason to believe he would be taking advantage of her or not be willing to get her treatment. I suggested they all three sit down and discuss a plan to make sure she gets the treatment she needs. I just feel the stress of this battle of control can only make her worse. I realize this is nothing legitimately I can do anything about and it is really not my business but I want to help anyway I can. Ever since the day I started dating him she has been welcoming and kind to me and we have never had any issues that a lot of mothers and girlfriends have. They have already taken her keys away and she is begging for them back. I know that is best but it just breaks my heart to see her lose her dignity while they argue over who should be in charge. Can anyone give me any advice as to how to proceed or even just things I can do for my boyfriend to help him and his mom?","Thank you red. I got more lovely info today. Apparently the sister has it in her head that the stepfather is trying to kill the mother and is giving her drugs. I do not know what is wrong with this girl. I know the father killed himself some ears back after going off medication. He had schizophrenia and suffered from a lot pf paranoia. I told my BF that I am willing to listen and be there but I cannot get involved any further in this. As a crohns patient I do not need this stress. I am fully convinced the mother has alzhimers and don't believe the husband is plotting anything nefarious.

 Since you are not ""officially"" in the family the best you can do is be there for your boyfriend and his mother. Her husband, if he will not take advantage of her and do what is right, has every right to be by her side and make the decisions on her behalf. I know that your bf and his sister are concerned over their mother, as they should be, but if they talk things out and try not to let their pride get in the way then hopefully they will be able to sort things out and come to a reasonable ending. It's a tough time when someone you know and love becomes afflicted with any sort of dementia and not only is it hard on the person who has it but the others around them as well.


 Just hearing what the sister is thinking, is something to look into. Maybe suggest to your bf to set up a nanny camera. They are camera hidden in stuffed animals. I'm sure there's a better adult way, like hidden cameras. Thing is not to let him know he's on camera and to find out if the sister is right or not."
Recognizing the early stages of Alzheimer's,"What Are the Signs of Alzheimer's Disease? The classic sign of early Alzheimer's Disease is gradual loss of short-term memory. Other signs include: * Problems finding or speaking the right word. * Inability to recognize objects. * Forgetting how to use simple, ordinary things, such as a pencil. * Forgetting to turn off the stove, close windows, or lock doors. Mood and personality changes also may occur. Agitation, problems with memory, and poor judgment may cause unusual behavior. These symptoms vary from one person to the next. Symptoms appear gradually in persons with Alzheimer's disease but may progress more slowly in some persons than in others. In other forms of dementia, symptoms may appear suddenly or may come and go. If you have some of these signs, this does not mean you have Alzheimer's disease. Anyone can have a lapse of memory or show poor judgment now and then. When such lapses become frequent or dangerous, however, you should tell your doctor about them immediately. Possible Signs of Alzheimer's Disease Do you or your elder have problems with any of these activities: * Learning and remembering new information. Do you repeat things that you say or do? Forget conversations or appointments? Forget where you put things? * Handling complex tasks. Do you have trouble performing tasks that require many steps such as balancing a checkbook or cooking a meal? * Reasoning ability. Do you have trouble solving everyday problems at work or home, such as knowing what to do if the bathroom is flooded? * Spatial ability and orientation. Do you have trouble driving or finding your way around familiar places? * Language. Do you have trouble finding the words to express what you want to say? * Behavior. Do you have trouble paying attention? Are you more irritable or less trusting than usual? Remember, everyone has occasional memory lapses. Just because you can't recall where you put the car keys doesn't mean you have Alzheimer's disease. www.ec-online.net/Knowledge/articles/earlyalz.html","Alzheimer's disease affected my Aunt's vision first.

 Hi, Is there a connection with B12vitamin deficiency? Regards Jacob"
Mom is arguing and yelling - new behaviour,"Hi all, My mom moved to assisted living in November, and it's beena smooth transition up until the last couple of weeks. She is yelling at people about where they sit or don't sit, who is late to the table, and if you correct her in any way. I've seen it a little bit, but it seems worse lately. I am calling her IPA on Monday to see about counseling that might help her cope with the changes she knows are happening. I was curious if there are any mild meds that might help. I see that ativan was a big debate on here, and I wouldn't want to risk any adverse reactions. I just don't know next steps. Can her facility ask her to leave due to this? Will another take her like this? She was known as the bell of the ball due to her usually very outgoing behaviour , and this is just so sad to watch and be subjected to when she turns it my way. Any advice? I thank you all in advance...","Most assisted living centers are equipped to deal with patients that have dementia or Alzheimer's. Unless she gets violent, I don't see why they wouldn't keep her. The AL center that I put my Gma in told me that if in the event they end up with a violent patient, they send them to a psych unit where they can be placed on medication; when they are stable they can come back. Whatever an AZ or dementia patient says, you can not take it personally. I know it's hard not to but you have to remember that they are in no control over their emotions and thoughts. They have different medications available and her doctor will be able to guide you better on what is the best one.


 Dear missmymom, it's turely a horrific thing to see a loved one going through my dementia or alzhmrs.I know from past experience my nanny,my mom's mom had it really bad, but was the sweetest thing in the whole wide world. Thankfully she would sit in her rocker,rockin away with her thumbaline doll. ''Do you remember those dolls????? Well that was her baby, aftera while, she couldn't remember all of our names, but she knew we loved her. She had more chocolate candy boxes in her dressers. What a riot. We were even more blessed because my 2nd cousin did her RN graduated and took a job where my grandmother was staying. She had alot i mean alot of family popping in and out whenever. I think that is key, escpecially with your mom's agitation. Sometimes they will put patience in gentle restraints, so not to hurt themselves, but also others. don't let that upset you.It really effects the entire family, i really can understand what your going through. maybe you can talk with her doctor i know there are meds out there that help out alot. but if you have acsess to the facility where your mom is at i would drop in as often as you can. you'd be surprised how the patient is treated when family is there. hand in there you are not alone. have a happy mothers day. susan (mazel tov)


 hi missingmymom, Call the facility and get hold of the social worker who works there. If no action with her, the go the Administrator. That's what they are there for to help the patient and the family.I know there are mild anti-depressants you can inquire about with her doc. Hang in there, maybe with new med her mood may change.Try and stay close.Visit often, sometimes our loved ones know us but they just can't get it out. But at least you know what's going on and will be there to help.Good luck and keep posting. sincerely,susan (mazel tov)


 My mom was put on a very low dose of Seroquel to help agitation. Agitation is normal in someone with AD. As far as asking her to leave, I guess it just depends on the facility and how they rate. My mom is in assisted living too and I am just waiting for the phone call to tell me she will have to be moved. She struck a CNA last week and thank God, it wasn't anything awful but still, just the fact that she hit someone I thought would be grounds for her to be moved. Best of luck Miriam


 Thanks much...So far just verbal outbursts and a few name calling incidents. Sometimes she denies doing it and others she says, yes I did, and he/she/they deserved it. Makes me wonder where we are in the staging f this. She is only 68, but this all began happening about 5 years ago. The doctors dont seem to want to actually diagnose it saying, doesn't matter, the treatments are all the same. I'll be working with her IPA Mnday, and will cover all of this then...thanks so much.


 My Mom was diagnosed w/ early dementia a few mos ago. 4 yrs ago she was diagnosed w/ ovarian cancer-She's done chemo and its really taken a physical toll on Her body. My problem is that she thinks Her confusion and lack of memory are due to Chemo. We have noticed for about a yr. Her memory loss and confusion. She on the other hand is in complete denial-Thinks Her neurolgist is crazy-doesnt want to go back to Him and won't consider meds for early dementia. She actually doesnt think She is confused when its completly clear to our family and Her friends? Any advice?"
"Newby, looking for feedback","Hi... I am new to this forum. I am 62 years old, Mom of two adult sons, married to same guy for 42 years. My overall health right now is probably fai. Here is my scary problem: For probably 2 years my short term memory has been lousey, but it growing much worse. Some examples: was religously for 2 months this Fall doing a mood chart and journal daily Then, it just disappeared from my mind and about 2 weeks ago came across it on the computer and it was like ""wow...I was doing that."" Right now my family and I are in constant battles of ""I told you that"" and me saying ""you did not."". Another problem I am a marriage counselor, and just recently started taking notes in sessions, because the second the couple left my office, I would forget what we talked about . Problem with the note taking...I write down something that makes sense to me at the time, but when I go over the notes, I often don't understand what I wrote down. Haven't had this particular problem for probably for two months, but when I did the laundry, I couldn't figure out, let's say how to hang a pair a pants on a hanger...I had the pants in one hand and hanger in the other...I knew I wanted the pants on the hanger, but I could not figure out how to get them on the hanger....took me 15 minutes to figure it out. Recently one of the most embarrassing things that happened at work is I thought I had a new client waiting in the waiting room and had left all the paperwork to fill out while I finished with the client I was currently with. So my client is done, I walk into the waiting room to introduce myself, take one look at the couple and I siad"" whoops, you guys have been here before, huh?"" (I knew the women looked very familiar), so we go get settled, I try too look in my appointment book to see their names and what I had written made no sense. So, I had to ask them their names...found their file and they had been in my office the two previous weeks (so this is number 3 visit. Oh, well....could go on forever with examples. So my Dad died of AZ at 82 yrs old. He had a sister who died of it ,too. My mom is 93 and she is still sharp. I am Bi=Polar (manic depression), and I tend to stay on the depressed side. I take about 4 different drugs...but I have taken them for 15 years and they never have bothered me before My husband says I can't risk going to the doc & get a AZ diagnosis because I will mess up our health insurance big time. I know you all are not doctors but I would appreciate some feedback. Yhanks","Hi, welcome to Healingwell. I'm sorry that you are having some memory difficulties. First you should go see the doctor and determine that your memory issues isn't from anything physical. At 62, I am assuming you already went thru menopause? Sometimes menopause can do a number on your memory but with your family history of AZ, you definitely should take this seriously regardless of what it does to your insurance. Because if you are indeed in the beginning stages of AZ, there are medications out there that can slow down the progression of it. Please have yourself checked out."
Problems with elderly parents who both have Alzheimer's,"Both of my parents have Alzheimer's, in different ways. My mom is much more out of it and rarely knows what is going on around her, and she gets sad a lot. She has diabetes, lost a lot of weight, and is under control, but she exhibits every time I see her very odd unacceptable behavior. When she sits down, she ""adjusts"" herself, i.e. pulls on her Depends, twists her skirt and pulls it up and down. To watch her makes me feel very much on edge....so I can only imagine what is going on in her head. She removes her dentures at will, at mealtimes, and cleans them. It is so gross and embarrassing that I can't even look at her doing it. Also, she takes her eyeglasses off all day, cleans them constantly, insisting they are dirty. I know she can't see well without them, but here odd behavior continues. My dad also has dementia as well as Parkinson's although he denies that anything is wrong with him. Just last week my parents' table in the dining room was about 6 inches away from where it is supposed to be and since it is harder for him to push his walker, he became badly agitated and upset beyond words. Then out of nowhere my mom decided she needs to eat and won't go to sleep until she does. She had already had her dinner and I guess forgot. She became unreasonable, while my dad is screaming at her that she must be in bed by 9:30pm. I told my dad to calm down and not to worry exactly what time my mom goes to bed, but he insisted that my mom agree to going too bed at 10PM. Everything has to be in a certain place, take place by a specific time, and he is controlling this way. These things happen on a weekend, when no administrators are on-site yet they are reachable by my parents' aide, who couldn't even explain to me on the phone what was going on, and he did absolutely nothing to intervene, didn't find a nurse or anything. He is the one to know what to do in this type of situation, NOT me. I want my life back as my dad started calling me every other second until the assistant administrator told him he is not allowed to call me because it makes me upset and sick (which it does). So now I call them less on the phone and see them less in person because I can't stand it anymore. I have my own fibro and lower back pain to deal with and need to have a life of my own. What would you do if this happened to your parent or parents...that live in an assisted living??My parents refuse to go to a nursing home so they will stay where they are until they are in hopelessly bad shape Any ideas? encouragement please?","Hello, Yes it's the disorder not you and maybe you need to step back and let the staff take over more....as much as you love them you need to love your self aswell. Sometimes that means taking care of ones self and doing what we need to do. If you don't take care of yourself you aren't going to be any good for anyone. Be kind to yourself and they will be fine they have the staff to take care of them and if they have a situation they know how to reach you...maybe you need a couple days off so to speak. Maybe a hot bubble bath!!! just a thought....


 Thanks everyone for your helpful replies. I did make a point a couple of months ago that I will not have to pick up the phone when my parents call me. I had this meeting with the administrators and supposedly everything was in order. My dad had been calling me daily, harrassing me to call my mom everyday or she could die. I realize he doesn't have the mental capacity to think things out reasonably anymore. The co-administrator of the AL has taken the time to speak to my dad about all the procedures and that he is NOT to call me when something goes wrong, particularly during weekends when none of the executive staff are present. However I have been told that there is a way to reach them if/when the need arises. It is their responsibility to figure out a real plan for weekends, and the aide sometimes can't make a simple ""fix"" when he can do so. I went to a caregivers support group just now and the ""leader"" announced that her group is really meant for spouses, and not children of parents with Alzheimer's! There was one other person whose parents have Alzheimer's there as well. When I asked her if I could continue to go to her support group meetings and at first she clearly answered me with a ""no."" So then I started to cry since I need support so badly and she said that I could continue to come! I am so tired of feeling like a fish out of water and that no one cares at all about my troubled life. There is another group strictly for ""Alzheimer's"" and the leader told me I would not belong there either because it's the same thing....it is mostly for spouses and not children of those with dementia. My therapist keeps encouraging me to go to these meetings and then I come home and the first thing I do is cry.....how many people are there to give me support?? Then I have to send requested info to my eldercare atty. and I never saved any proof. Why didn't the attorney to keep track of these things in the first place?? My fibrofog is so bad and I just get so anxious with all the paperwork and I already take anti anxiety meds and antidepressants. I am truly beginning to feel like I've lost my mind and really, honestly, I would rather sleep most of the day and hide in the house. How can I find the right person or place to let me vent and f'n listen to me and my feelings. I am so emotional, and I am trying so hard to get my life back and feel normal. I have my papers scattered throughout my house, most of which regard my parents. I need help, I tried my previous therapist, but she mostly tells me I need to do guided meditation and things like that to calm me down. On top of all this my left retina detached and I had surgery to re-attach it. Now cataract(s) are getting worse and I fell totally blind in the dark. I know I can't drive before or after sunset because with the glare I can see nothing, and this is so depressing also. Who will be able to help me get my life back on track and listen to me vent and cry. I don't know what else to do. I am backing off regarding my parents' care and letting the AL do their jobs properly. And I can't help myself when I get so emotional...I just can't.


 I think snowy is right here and you hve now found us to vent to it is hard looking after your parents seeing them change and being sick self i did both of mine til they passed. i really miss them .my daughter has to do 75 80 percent of all around here due to recent hospitilization and my being deaf..i feel like a burden..i know this is hard but i also know we will listen to u and i know too that when your parents are gone you will miss them...set up a meeting with al doc and set guidlines for what you want n need n for what yr parents need..stay with us


 There is a dementia floor at the AL, but the management still don't think my mom belongs there. I guess with the assistance of my parents' aide they manage okay, but once her dementia gets even worse and she becomes harder to deal with they will both have to move downstairs to that unit. They can still partake in the entertainment at night and activities (but I know they won't want any of that). Then to move them downstairs will be a huge problem with them and I think they may have to have separate apartments. Meanwhile the Medicaid planning is still going on and I have to provide the eldercare attorney with documentation from their banks as to withdrawals and transfers. I don't think I have any of the deposit or withdrawal slips but I hoe the bank can provide whatever is necessary. Then I have 2 other banks to deal with. It just isn't fair that I have to do all this stuff when the attorney has already earned about $32,000 and it might even cost more.


 Hi Janet - Firstly id like to say your not alone in this situation, and there are people/organisations who can assit you with the proper care that your parents need. I know the stress and emotins you are going through as I am going through it myself, I am 34 and have looked after my nan for 4 years, solid! I gave up my job and teaching career to look after her because she brought me up, my nan is 86 and over the years had deteriated to the point of not being able to do nothing for her self, and also has short memroy loss, emphasimia in final stages, and recently got to the point of being agressive and wanting her own way like a child which makes my life impossible, due to being called every 20 mins 18 hours a day. She also phones the my sister about 300 times a day and also smokes near her oxgen""when left alone"". Oh and im not her carer and dont get paid for looking after her, as i do it becuase out of love What you can do if you want to put your parents in a nursing home: If your living in the UK, then what u need to do is to go and see a Social worker and your GP and arrange for them to come out and assess your parent/parents, the social worker will air your concerns and then ask your GP for a sittuation diagnosis on your parents and if they can manage by themselves, and if u explain to your doctor about how it is affecting your own life and making you depressed which it does, then he will probaly urge for your parent to be put into a home. The social worker cannot directly put your parents into a ""home if they are in there right minds"", but you can also ask for social worker to have your parents evaluated via Psychiatric doctor to which a report will be submitted from them to the social worker with there verdict. I hope this helps - spence x Post Edited By Moderator (Red_34) : 8/29/2010 6:37:35 AM (GMT-6)


 It'the disease,not them.They can't help what they are doing.Does the ALF not have a dementia wing?


 It's upsetting to see the ones we love go downhill mentally. What you're mother is doing can't be helped. Unfortunately that is all part of Alzheimers. The appropriate rules and regulation of society don't apply to them anymore because that part of them is lost. I agree that you need to step back and let the staff take care of your mom and dad now. It is what they are paid for. I don't mean to step away from them permanently or anything like that. It's more a delegation of duties. As for the phone calls, tell the aides that you can only be reached at certain times of a day and if your parents become agitated after that then they have to deal with it. I was the primary caregiver to my grandmother for 4 years before I put her in an assisted living. As the year progressed she became more and more depressed and agitated. I was getting phone calls at all hours because she would have them call me. Finally I had to tell them that I just can't handle these phone calls. And that I would talk my gma down but I just can't both physically and mentally handle the talk downs at all hours. My health was being majorly affected and I had to think of my kids and husband. I know we love them and we want to do what is right but sometimes we have to take a step back as hard as it is. Take your concerns to the manager of the facility and see if you and them can make a compromise.


 She was wrong to tell you NO!!!


 SNOWY, I AGREE WITH YOU BUT I HAVE NO DESIRE TO EVER RETURN TO THAT GROUP BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER FEEL ACCEPTED OR BE COMFORTABLE THERE. THERE IS ANOTHER ALZ. SPT. GROUP RIGHT NEAR ME AND I WILL CALL BEFORE I GO TO ANY SUPPORT GROUP MEETING. One day when the leader experiences my very same problems, I hope there is no one there to be by her side. Somehow, I seem to be there for everyone I could possibly help, so what is her problem?..................................................................................................................................................Edit PLZ refrain from use of all caps here in responce to Snowy or other members as it gives impression you are yelling...........thanks...lyn Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 1/22/2010 9:44:13 PM (GMT-7)


 Hi am just kinda lost here why do you have to do this stuff IF there are attorneys being paid to do so..perhaps it is different here in Ontario i dont know but i do know i either would be looking after it all ..which i did..or hving an attorney not both....jmho...lyn


 You can talk to us. You should still have a relationship with your parents. It is the disease that is making them this way. To deny your own parents phone calls, yes it is stressing and hard, but you shouldnt cut them out completely. Fibromyalgia is a hard disease to deal with--I know. I am taking care of my grandmother with dementia and I have fibromyalgia and I also am in chemotherapy. I do this 24/7 7 days a week. I only get breaks to go to my doctor appointments and 3 to 4 hours a week by my mother who relieves me. Why do I do it even though it is too much? Because I used to work in a nursing home--I know about behind scenes. I know they will leave patients for a few hours soiled in their own feces. I won't let my grandmother go through that if I can prevent it. You can get support by talking here, going to a councelor at mental health. In fact, if you ask DHS for the elderly caretaker manager she can send you information of support groups that are for families--not just spouses. Social workers can not move a person into a home unless they are a danger to others or themselves. If it is really that hard for you, you can make your parents a ward of the state. Therefore, you will never have to do anything at all for them. No banking, no calling, no visits. I felt so bad for those patients when I worked in the nursing home that I gave up my only 2 days off and went in as a volunteer and strictly visited the patients that had no family coming to see them. That way, even though they aren't there in the head, they know they aren't alone and someone cares. I remember a day I was called at home saying to come early because one of those patients that had no family coming to visit wasnt going to last a few more hours. Right before she passed away she told me ""thank you. I love you."". Maybe an act of God, for the few seconds of clarity moments before her death, one will never know but I at least know I was appreciated. I at least made someones day. Maybe you could come up with a plan and hire a finacial overseer who handles all the finances. If you have not done so, you need to be named the legal guardian. You can set up a routine with them like your parents are allowed to call you X amount of times in X amount of length. You could visit them X amoutn of times a week too. Just know, even in the disease, they are there somewhere in their mind. They may not remember you all the times, but they know you love them and care about them even on those days. Sure, they will say things sounding off the wall, and insane, but oh well-- its a dellusion. Like last night, my grandmother had a dillision-- told me to get the guys out of the freezer! I asked her what guys to get ""I dont know."" so I said ""Wow the freezer is bigger than I thought"" and she started laughing and told me ""I guess so it is."" So I had her look with me in the freezer and I showed her the food we had in it. They will sound weird at times, but just go with it, go with the flow. REmember laughter is the best medicine. Just regular Mental health councelors can help you vent off about your parents--just ask my councelor- I vent about grandma there. And you have us, we are like an family, always here for one another. (just ask Red, lol)"

 If you have a problem getting her up don't hesitate to call 911.... As for her tooth,let the dentist pull is if he can that way it won't cause her infection if left in to fall out later......


 Would you believe this? I gave my mom a piece of chocolate today and she tried to take it out of her mouth. I pushed it back in like I always do with other small snacks I give her when ever she has this annoying habit of spitting food out that she thinks is too big. well, when I turned away from her I heard something drop to the floor. It was part of a tooth. Her front tooth broke off in 3/4. At least she had the intelligence to spit it out knowing it's not to be swallowed. Unfortunately this is not the same decayed tooth that her dentist was reluctant to pull. I think the enamel of this tooth was wearing thin and just broke off. It's not noticeable at all because she never liked to open her mouth much and never does when she smiles. The remaining part is small enough so she doesn't look like jaws.


 I'm sorry but did you post to the wrong topic? I didn't mention bipolar.


 I see. My aunt is bi-polar and my bestfriend from childhood killed herself with the disease. bi-polar people aren't thinking straight but at least they had the ability to think and not have brain freeze


 If you continue to stay active mentally and physically, the disease may not get you as quickly. Fight! I wish my mom was a fighter but she's not and never has been. She always wanted things done quickly and take the easy way out. I try to get her to recite the alphabet daily but she stopped doing it long ago. It used to roll out of her tongue just like that but now she skips about 15 letters in between. As for even writing her name, it has now turn into scribbly lines and circles. My mom used to have BEAUTIFUL handwriting. Right now she's wearing 2 layers of diaper with a pair of vinyl underwear I got for her online. She's uncomfortable and hot and itchy. She's half asleep 20 hours a day and her legs are like jello and often falls backward if I try to her to walk just 5 steps by herself. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.


 That is fantastic! You should write a book.


 Something to let people know how you did it.


 Hello, My mother's dentist just informed me that she has a cavity on her front tooth that is pretty substantial. He gave 2 options for this. 1. Get a root canal and put a crown there. 2. Pull the whole tooth and put in dentures but.... for liability reasons the dental office will not do this unless my mom goes under. He suggested #2 because he said the tooth is beyond saving. The cost of the anesthesia alone will be about $1K not including what the dentist will charge. I'm more concerned of the injection to put her out. Is it safe?


 Her dentist said if she's not in any pain then just leave it alone and let it eventually fall off by itself. She can chew with her other teeth. At her age, putting a denture there is just for looks. My mom has fallen down twice yesterday which was very scary. Once in the parking lot of her podiatrist office and then a few hours later at home in my bedroom. Each time she lost her balance. The 2nd time she hurt her lower back. I think she fell backwards and landed on the carpet banging her backside to my desk. She's now complaining about the pain but no bones seem to be broken, just banged up.


 Thanks for the heads up but that wasn't the reason. I got her new shoes and I had her wear it around the house to see if they were the right fit. She lost her balance because the shoes didn't support her enough. Since then she's walking ok.


 Also because she was taking generic Mirapex which I could tell didn't work so well for her. I switched her back to name brand Mirapex 3 days ago and I already notice a difference in her flexibility and awareness of what I say to her and she's not as dazed as before. Now if only I know an easier way to lift her off the floor when she slips down from the couch. I had temporary numbness in my left hand this morning when she tried to life herself back up with my help but I had to let go because my hand didn't have any strength left. Eventually she gave herself a little push while I pulled. It's never easy but I can tell you this. When she was on the generic Mirapex it took me and her sometimes caretaker to lift her up because she didn't have any energy in her to help us out. Unfortunately I'm generally alone with my mom so I don't have the luxury of another pair of hands to help out.


 Thanks for the suggestion. The first one won't work because she can't follow directions. 2nd one won't work for the same reason. Think of lifting someone that can't think.


 Thanks for the links. I did a similar search online prior to posting here. Calling 911 on a regular basis is not a good idea and the hoist mentioned costs thousands of dollars. I think I just have to bulk up and LIFT. Thanks again.


 My mom slips down a lot. calling 911 would be a daily occurrence if I did. Her dentist said although it's pretty decayed it's ok to let it fall off itself since she's not complaining of any pain which would indicate infection. Meanwhile I've been flossing and brushing her teeth really well lately. They are sparkling clean and glossy.


 Mentally impaired means diff.things.Bi Polar is mentally impaired. Alzheimer Dementia is a Neurodegeneric disease,Two different diseases......They are not lumped together......

 I have dementia but I can still think reason but at some point I won't be able to.......BUT not everyone with dementia knows this or can reason about it.......


 I was dx 13 yrs ago,still going good.........


 Don't think so.Not a writer......

progression of alz,"I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT IS THE PROGRESSION OF ALZ, MY MOM HAS A MILD CASE AND SHE IS ON MEDICATION, BUT I WAS WONDERING HOW LONG BEFORE IT BECOMES MODERATE TO EXTREME. CHAVA","No 2 are alike!


 There is no way to tell. A person with AZ may have mild symptoms all their (AZ) life and never progress while others progress quickly even while on many medications.


 My mom was diagnosed with Alz 7 years ago and although she seemed to progress at a fairly rapid rate the first year, since then, the progression has been very slow. She is on two medications, Namenda and Aricept and her physician now feels that the meds are helping to keep her status quo."
coming to terms with Grandfathers Alzheimers,"so My Grandfather who I love dearly and have a very special relationship with is in the beginning stages of Alzheimers. He lives in a different state to me so I dont get to see him very often at all but we used to talk on the phone almost every day. Since he started getting sick he has stopped calling me and I know its because he simply forgets. Every time I call him the conversation is very frustrating we go around in circles and recently he has forgotten who he was talking to half way through the conversation and when I tell him it is me it takes him a while to figure out who I am. Its heartbreaking! I am now at the stage where I almost dread calling him which I know is awful and it makes me feel so guilty. But its just too hard to hear him be so confused and then not know who I am. I miss my grandad and I dont know who this person is, its not him. I dont know who I can relate to him anymore but I am afraid that if I dont I will regret it when he passes on. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks","I go through that with my Grandmother all the time. I found with her, that when she doesn't remember me, she remembers her daughter, my mother. So I just go over the family line like saying ""x got married to y and they had 6 kids. the kids are a, b, c, d, e, f and I am D."" It gets frustrating at times. If she seems really to not believe me, I just agree with her.


 Hi As a mom who now suffers with short term memory loss i see the frustration n pain my cait goes thru when trying to be around me 24/7 i remember things from long ago but hv to write down things i did yesterday or day before it is very hard on me to be left alone all the time i do need to get out n do things ..live i hv started going to my brothers place n the beach but i do know they r feeling the strings of caregiver role i know all to well what that feels like i looked after mom n dad til their deaths try to keep going there correct but dont judge her /him do memory challenges with them not hard ones..easy so they dont frustrate quick most of all KEEP LOVING THEM i like Red hv lost all my family n i am the head now to this dd but i do hv the special memory of doing things with them n for them blessings lyn


 Very good idea i need ppl to keep reaching out to me n i know they get frustrated n pain for me especially my daughter i see her hurt n i wish i could change it you are a great grandaughter REMEMBER THAT PLZ huggles lyn


 the person knows you are someone who loves them so never give up trying.......


 Keep calling him. Even if you think he's not there, he is in some form. Even if it's for a short time, he might find comfort in hearing your voice. I know it's hard. It was very hard on me too when my Gma had it. But I kept plugging along, even if I had a good cry when I got home. But I like to think that she took some comfort in knowing that someone still cared for her and loved her. My Gma is now passed but I feel comfortable with myself because I gave that extra mile to try to ease her mental suffering.


 I'm sorry to hear that I am going threw the same thing with my grandma. Stay in contact as much as you can they might not remember it right away but in the back of there mind they do. My grandma just moved to the stage of getting very angry and just mean to my mother and I the two that take care of her. But you just have to remind yourself that theres nothing to do but be there for them the only way theres even a chance of them remembering you longer is if there is still fresh memories. Another thing I have noticied is if they arguing its best just to agree it will work them up more and get them more confused. I hope the best for you and your family stay strong for yourself and your grandfather. Peace and much love Wisco


 Thank you for all of your advice! I do love my grandfather very much and every time I talk to him I am glad of it but it is very hard to think of him not knowing who I am and eventually not being here. I miss who he was, it doesnt even feel like that person is there anymore but i know he is the same person and I know he still loves me too. I will continue to reach out to him until the very end because I know he still loves me and wants to hear from me. He has done so much for me my whole life now its my turn to do something for him I figure.


 Definitely keep calling him. My grandfather was one of my best friends, and when he was diagnosed with AZ I was heartbroken. I kept visiting for a while, but after he started to forget who I was I simply stopped - I couldn't handle it. I have felt so guilty since he died for giving up on him. I know it's hard but keep calling him..It's harder if you don't."
DENIAL,"My mom has alz, my sister and I think she is in denial. How do we deal with this, she wont even let me go to doc's appt with her. How do we go on in the future and help her if she is in denial. I'm very worried. Is this common? My sister is also has notice that my mom is getting a little hostle. She has never been hostle with me, I know that this is part of alz, but I would of thought she would be hostle with everyone. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Chava","Yes, denial is part of it just like it is with any chronic illness. I agree on the POA. If you can get her to sign you or someone else as one right now, it will make things easier if she was to progress. If you can get her to sign a POA, then she has no say if you were to go into the docs with her. Hostility is common with AZ. My Gma would get hostile with my daughter, but in her eyes my son and I could do no wrong. I hated doing it, truly, but because of this reason, I had to my Gma out of my house and into assisted living - my daughter was only 13 at the time and took my Gma's hostility hard.


 Drnial NOT the river,lol.........


 Can you get your Mom to sign POA so you can be informed??? Also DPOA for legal/monetary things......


 Denial is huge. My Mom has been dx'd with dementia, but both of my parents were in denial. We tried to get homecare, etc. for them to no avail. They kept saying they were fine. I finally told my Dad that he would need to come to us when he decided they needed more care. Finally he did that just a couple of weeks ago. He told me that my Mom is wearing him out because she misplaces things all the time. My Mom who was the sweetest being on earth has become irritable. I think it's because she knows that things are not normal for her and it must be tough not being able to remember events, where you put things, etc. I also had to put my foot down about doctor appts. I told them that I needed to be with. I explained to the doctor when we went in that I needed to represent my Mom, and she agreed. I signed a power of attorney form so I can access her online doctor's records/appointments. Take care and good luck with your Mom."
Lewy Body Question,"Hello to all, I am new to this group but not to HealingWell. I have been on the Prostate Cancer forum for almost a year.

Thanks, Joe","Another good resource is A Psychiatrist With Lewy Body Dementia - http://knittingdoc.wordpress.com/ The author of the blog acually has Lewy Body Disease, and is no longer able to write very often.

 The meds that help AD will not help FTD....."
To all the caregivers.......,I am just curious to see how we are all doing. How are your parents/grandparents/partners? Are you taking some time out for yourself?,"That's awesome Snowy! We all need our own ""me"" time including people that have mild dementia. I sure hope you pamper yourself when Larry goes off?


 I couldn't agree more Snowy...just because you have dementia that it makes you unable to use a computer or something. I totally disagree! There might come a time in someones AD history that they won't be able to use the computer but with dementia, who knows how long you can continue doing the things that you enjoy, including computer time. Is that how you spend your ""me"" time? Or do you do something else such as take a nice hot soak in the tub? ;)


 Good for you! You are truly an inspiration!


 I cared for my mom, in my home, for a year. She was diagnosed with AD 7 years ago; she is now in assisted living and yet, after 7 years, she is still functioning well. Sure, there are many things she cannot do any longer, but so many things she still can do. She is 88 year old, bless her heart. She has her own room, knows when to go for her meals to the dining room, can use the phone (nunbers are on speed dial with our names on them), goes to some activities, and gets herself ready in the morning, with some assistance. She has been on Aricept and Namenda for 7 years and her doctor truly believes it is the medications that are keeping her ""status quo""... I visit her 2 to 3 x a week, do her laundry and just spend time with her. Miriam


 These medications are wonderful aren't they Miriam?Too bad they don't always work for everyone......


 I was just thinking the other day what a wonderful summer it's been being able to spend most of my Friday's off with my parent's having lunch and taking my Mom to do errands. I know this may be the last summer that my Mom remembers doing these things -- and I enjoy our time as much as she does.


 Chicagorunner, welcome to Healingwell :) We are active here but we are a small and humble forum with only a few actual participating members. But thank you for the link. Caregivers sometimes just do not receive the recognition they deserve.


 Larry is still able to go off & do things with our Dr friend,& other people.I enjoy my ""me"" time,lol......


 Ya know what jacks my jaws? Too many people say I don't have dementia because I can type on pc,still articulate.Yada,yada.Gimmie a break! I don't have AD as I was first dx with It's vascular Dementia......13 years now.........MY how time flies....


 I'm on my pc many hours a day.Sometimes I get on my scooter put the dog on my lap & ride around the neighborhood.......Ilfe is for the living & I'm still living....I do have problems at times with memory,mostly short term.Long term still very good......When stressed I'm a dork,lol......


 I know this was for caregivers but I was a paid caregiver for nearly 40 years......


 Miriam, it's great that you are spending time with your mom. So many people just dump off their loved ones at a home and forget about them. That burns me up to no end! So I love hearing stories such as yours. I'm sure your mom appreciates you being there for her.


 The medications are really wonderful. We never expected them to do what they are doing. When mom first began taking them, her doctor told us they would help, for a while, and here we are, 7 years later. I don't think he really knew at the time how long they would help. Her doctor heads up a dept at a very large teaching hospital in Chicago for memory loss/Alzheimer's/dementia so he's very aware and on top of new drugs, etc. I take mom to see him twice a year and he is so pleased to see how well she is doing. I have two sisters, so between the three of us, we do see that someone is visiting mom almost every day. One of my sisters is a nurse and works at the facility where mom is living now. She works 3 to 11p, so she is able to check in on mom, tuck her in, make sure to grab her clothes and put them in the laundry basket so she doesn't put them on again the next day...that kind of thing... I try to go in the late afternoon when mom gets bored and anxious and I bring one of my dogs, a Golden Retriever that the residents just love to pet and it gives them all something to chat about . I do work full time, so I try my best to get there to see mom, as I said at least twice a week and sometimes 3 times a week. She doesn't remember the visit, but I do. be well Miriam


 I've been looking around for a caregiver forum--not sure if this is very active--but I just saw a neat contest where caregivers can be recognized for all they do. My mom was a nurse and I can attest to how hard they work without enough recognition. All you have to do is write a little story about yourself and you could win a spa day or other prizes. http://www.eldercarelink.com/Go/contest/main/1


 Thanks for the reply. Looking forwarding to stopping in now and then!"
Bringing him home,My father is not doing too well. He is not eating or drinking very much at all. His regular doctor said he is fading away. We have decided to bring him home to live out his last days with me and my husband. I know it won't be easy........,"If your father is going to pass away soon at least he will be surrounded by the people that love him. To me that is the best gift you can give him. It is very very hard to watch someone we love die. I speak this from the heart. I was with my Gma when she took her last breath. My heart goes out to you and your family.


 I totally agree with Sherry..i was with both mom n dad when they passed...i like believing they knew i was there with them and for just an instant did know i was there....thoughts n prayers are with you....lyn

 Dorsery.s Daughter, I am not sure what brought me to the forum today. I have not posted since my fathers passing in October. It is so difficult for a daughter to lose a father. I lost mine in October after his seven year battle with Alzheimer's. You are doing a very courages thing by bringing him home. My father passed away in his home with all of his children and wife surrounding him. Even though this is a very difficult time, for you as well as you father, it is a time you will never forget. Remember to stay close to him, look him in they eye, talk to him, really show him that he is loved. I miss my father every day, but also try to think of him looking down on all of us with a clear mind, and he is truly happy. I wish you well on this journey. Hydrangea


 Hi, I'm sorry to hear that your dad isn't doing well but know that your have lots of support here. It's difficult to lose anyone but more when it is a parent I think. It is spring time a time of new life for some that is a comfort. You are in my thoughts and prayers.


 Thank ya'll so much. I will keep everyone updated.


 Hi, my Daddy is coming home today. I hope everything goes well. Dorsey's Daughter


 Daddy is at home. He is doing pretty good behavorial wise. But he hasn't eaten anything today. I have offered him different foods but he keeps spitting everything out. Dorsey's Daughter


 I have been away this week. I am so sorry that your dad is worse. I hope that things will improve at home. Bless your heart. Stacey


 Just checking in hun to see how you are doing is yr dad eating anything at all.... what about ensure drinks n puddings keeping you in thoughts n prayers like Red i was with both mom n dad till the end i know they are looking down on me and are now with peace lyn"
Something to share,"The Thief The thief came again. I can always tell. He crept in undetected and took his plunder from the storehouse. He has gotten bolder. It used to be how to make coffee or use the TV remote. He is no longer content with the inconsequential. He wants things that are more precious now. He took the memory of a first kiss, a very special kiss, given to a grandbaby moments after birth. It was the very first kiss in this world. The thief whisked away that precious, irreplaceable memory with no regret or remorse. Oh what a cruel thief he is. Sometimes he leaves a trace of a memory behind and other times he wipes every hint away. His thirst is insatiable. He will not be satisfied until he strips the memory storehouse bare. I know his name. It is Alzheimer’s. I cannot stop him as he pillages and robs those he meets. One day he will be stopped and eliminated. However, until then I must be vigilant, always striving to add to the storehouse while reinforcing the door.","VERY VERY TRUE it is definitely a thief one day we shall find a way to beat thi..i pray its soon\ take care n ty for posting that lyn

vascular dementia,"Hi friends my girlfriends mom has had Vascular dementia for some years now. She's in her early 70's but her mind is still clear in some ways. But for the most part, her symptoms seem to get a little worse by the year. Its really tragic for me to see my girlfriend suffer as she does. We live in Spain, and I know that her mother has been on the same meds for the last 10 years. I'm not even sure what it is but I could find out. What I'm wondering is: are there any better treatments out there that could help stop or slow down the progress of the disease. M's mother basically remembers her daughters and sons, and basic things, but I believe she thinks of them as teenagers. Also whenever I'm there she generally repeats the same stories over and over again without refrain. She could repeat the same story all night really. To give you an idea of where she's at.

coping with husband's dementia,"My husband has been on Aricept for four yrs; MD syas he has a dementia. He is mainly very forgetful: cannot remember where he puts anything, who he has talked with, what people tell him. He also has lost ability to do things around house because he just cannot remember how to do them or where things are. In addition, he has some personality changes. To compound his problems, he had back surgery last yr and is in constant mild pain but refuses medication. He is also Diabetic on insulin He is so depressed (takes antidepressant) because of not being able to do things he use to do and because he is not the person he was at one time. He is 75. It is so frustrating for him, and for me. Recently, he has taken up the childish habit of pouting if I don't do everything he wants or agree with him all the time. I hate pouting. He goes to bed when he pouts. Thus he spends a lot of time in bed. Any suggestions for how to deal with pouting? I just ignore him. Apparently, that is not the right thing to do. Thanks","People with dementia or Alzheimer's are not in control of their emotions nor do they understand what they are feeling anymore; it confuses them. For instance, when they become mad they don't know why they are mad or why they got mad in the first place nor do they recognize that they are mad; it's a disconnection of feelings and things are very chaotic. When he pouts, maybe you can try to redirect it. When he starts to pout, try to get him to do something that takes him out of that mental loop such as going for a walk or any of Snowy's suggestions; something that makes him happy. Ignoring a person with AZ or dementia can only make them feel isolated even more and they tend to stick with the last emotion that occurred.


 Try to engage him in some activity at home or go out someplace with him.Lunch maybe or supper.Do you have a senior citizens center? Both of you go eat lunch there,see what if any activities they offer.....We have exercise machines,computer room,card/domino tables,big screen tv,blood pressures are checked twice a month as 1 of the nursing services comes in. we have a van that takes some to the stores here in town,dr appointments,beauty shop or barber shop,birthday party's every month,the list goes on.........He's bored......."
Paranoia with Alzheimer's,"My father was diagnosed with AD a few years ago. He has become increasingly paranoid. He is supposed to have help with any financial decisions, but he has become paranoid about us knowing what he is doing. This may not sound so important, but he is making trades with money that we would like to keep to help care for him. We would love to be able to get help so that he could remain at home throughout the disease. He no longer is able to differentiate between 400 and 40000. It seems likely that he could make a BIG mistake. This is a very sad disease in so many other, bigger ways, but if you have suggestions it would be appreciated. When does a person with AD need to be declared incompetent? I think that would devastate my dad. Thanks! Stacey","You can contact his doctor and talk with them how to proceed to declare him incompetent and even though it would devasate your father, you would be doing him a favor by taking over these decisions for him. I agree you should of had the POA when he was diagnosed and still somewhat lucid to make that decision. Paranoia is part of AD unfortunately. My Gma would constantly hide things, forget where she put it and accuse my daughter of stealing it (she was always picking on my daughter for some reason). She would lock the doors all the time and I can not even tell you how many times she had locked me and my husband out of the house. Later when we moved her to the assisted living center, she would lock her door and the aides had to put duct tape over her catch so it wouldn't lock (they had to keep it unlocked in case of emergencies). Your father is going to start doing increasingly erratic things and it's best to get the POA as soon as possible. How is he doing the trading? Online, phone contact, in person? Once you have the POA, call these instituitions up and tell them that he no longer able to make these trades. If he is doing it online, you may want to get his password and change it. Someone needs to step in and take over before he ends up losing all his money.


 It's good that you have POA and how I could tell that it was time for me to intercede on my Gma's behalf was when she lost the ability to make LOGICAL decisions. The POA works when that person is unable to think logically and cognitively for themselves. If the decisions they make can harm them or others and yes that includes financial. When in doubt, talk to his doctor and they can point you in the right direction if they can not offer advice themselves. I talked frequently with my Gma's doctor when she started declining and he was a huge help. People with AD THINK they can do these things and that they have it all right. They can not tell the difference between what is the right way and wrong way anymore. They lose the ability to sort things out in their minds. And yes, it WILL hurt them them to have their independence taken away piece by piece and that is what makes this disease so horrible. It robs them of not only their lives but their piece of mind as well. It steals THEM. It is up to the caregivers to decide when it is the right time to take that piece of independence and no, it's not easy. In fact, it is an extremely hard thing to do. :(


 Stacey, how is your father doing?


 We are not sure if my Gma had Alzheimer's or another form of dementia (most indicators pointed to Alzheimer's though) and I watched my Gma declined slowly and it was very hard. She lived with me for nearly 4 years (after the death of my Gpa) when I had to move her into an assisted living center. I loved my Gma dearly and it broke my heart to see her unable to do things she so proudly used to do before. She was also almost blind due to macular degeneration, then her hearing went and she also developed bladder cancer (went thru chemo and radiation). She always had a smile on her face regardless of how many obstacles were put before her. But having her lose her mind was the toughest thing of all. My mother died when I was 10 years old but my Gma (my mom's mom) was always there for me growing up. To watch my proud, independent, strong grandmother lose her ability to do simple things such as brushing her teeth brought me to tears. My Gma died last December and I find peace in knowing that she is once again whole and with my Gpa but dang do I miss her! You are not alone in this because there are so many of us out there that have loved ones suffering from this horrible disease. So please do not hesitate to share your concerns here and please keep us updated on the status of your father ok?


 Stacey would a simple solution not be in taking the computer away and as POA selling all his shares. I take it he spends alot of time on the computer looking at how his investments are doing. The issue you may have will be when he loses this freedom.But what you have to remember is that one day he could invest in the wrong company and buy to many shares and lose the lot.


 I thought this might be the case. What ever you decide it will be very hard for you to make that decision. You could put a password on your computer and as mentioned before phone up the relavant brokers that you have POA and that he is unable to trade .All depends how strong you are at tackling this issue which sounds small. but to you it will be a big issue to tackle. Dont leave it to long as time is what we dont all have and eventually he will worsen.


 I made sure hubby had POA so whenever there's a need he can use it......We don't have to be incompetit for them to use it.Hubby was able to use it when I had surgery last year.It sure helps to have back up,lol.......


 When my Gma was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's she was pretty much still there. She was only doing odd random things but for the most part she could make her own decisions and was quite lucid. When she was diagnosed with bladder cancer, I would take her to the oncologist and the doctor would talk to me like she wasn't there. I did NOT like that at all. He would ask me questions and I would simply say ""I don't know, why don't you ask her."" And with a look of mild suprise they would. She was still competent and able to make her own decisions but many people, doctors included, think that once a person is diagnosed with AD that the can not make logical decisions on their own anymore. So even though the person may still be competent, many think that they can't understand. So no, you are not automatically incompetenet upon diagnosis however AD is not really known that well by the public. They know the name of the disease and what it is but there is a stigma associated with it that people automatically assume that the person can't think for themselves anymore.


 I do have a POA, but don't yet feel like I should take it all away. He is giving in somewhat to some of the things the doctor wants him to do. He is limiting his activity (by choice). And we've put passwords on some accounts. Hopefully he will never notice. My dad isn't incompetent. That isn't to say that he couldn't make a terrible mistake. I just so want this time that he has left to be enjoyable and not angry and depressed. We are making some headway. Dad is not near the end or in bad shape yet. The paranoia seems to come and go. It seems reasonable almost, because he just can't remember what happened to things. So difficult and yet so much worse to come. I hope that one day there will be an answer/cure! Thanks! Stacey


 All the time on the computer & trading could be causing him stress which makes the disease worse.......Fun time is 100% better............


 I hope he continues in the working in nature always good for the mind n soul imho be well huggs lyn


 You should have gotton DPOA(power of attorney) long before now......If he's wasting money its time to step in & put a stop to it somehow........


 Thank you. We do have POA. That was done around the time of diagnosis. He is trading online. I'm a bit fearful of his reaction if I tried to cut this off. He has been doing it his whole life. He still understands it pretty well. He just can't get numbers straight anymore. I'm surprised that we've had no major trading problems yet. I don't know how the POA works. I thought that he would need to be declared incompetent for it to be in place. I don't even know if he IS incompetent. He can still do so MANY things. He can't carry on a conversation very well, because he has lost so many words. Yet much of his thinking is still quite good. He is still driving - but VERY slow. Thank you for your thoughts and help! Stacey


 Sherry, thanks so much! Yes, it is just piece by piece and it is so hard. We will see the doc Mar 4 and hope that he will point us in the right direction. I so appreciate your help. It is comforting and SO sad to know that we are not alone. So sorry about your Gma. Stacey


 Thanks for asking Sherry! He is doing okay. He seems to have some days much better than others. He has always been a proud and in control man. So this is hard for him and for us. The paranoia continues to be a problem. We will see the neuro psychol on March 4th. I hope that he can point us in the right direction. I know that the late stages of this disease must be so much worse than what we are dealing with here. I already find this so hard emotionally to deal with. Thanks, Sherry! Stacey


 Thanks Sherry! You have really been through it all. I am so sorry. Stacey


 Thanks for the thoughts! I know, it should be easy. The money is my father's. He has worked hard for it and it is so important to him. It is the only thing he is getting much enjoyment from. I think we will have to have support from his doctor to take this step. AD seems to have many stages or levels. He still has a lot left. We are trying to stay on top of what he is doing. I just hope that his doctor will know if or when it is time and can help us. We can't get rid of the computer (he would then use the phone), because we are trying to keep a small business going. We are not in the terrible stage of AD, like Sherry has described to me. What is going on here should be easy, but he is still very much with us. Stacey


 I think after a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's any financial decisions they make are null and void because they're considered incompetent to reason.


 People are NOT immediately incompetent upon diagnosis of Alzheimer's. It is difficult to tell sometimes, as in our case. Some of the person's brain may be failing while other parts are not so effected. People are diagnosed very early on with some memory problems. When my father was first diagnosed he was just forgetting names and some words. That really did not render him incompetent to make important decisions. It is a difficult path. Stacey

 The only thing that has ever given my dad enjoyment is working and making money. I know it's very sad and I hope that we can find new things together to enjoy. He is trying to keep things more simple to alleviate the stress. You are right on about the stress though. I can see a big difference with him on days that he keeps life a little simpler. He is trying to stay busy with yard work and things around the house. Thanks! Stacey"
Drugs,"Hi Everyone, Yesterday I attended a meeting dealing with caring in general in the community. The point I wished to put across, was about the carer's control for a loved one who was incapable of of communicating with medical staff. From my experience I've found doctors and nurses prescribing anti-psychotic drugs as a matter of course to patients with AD, in hospitals, Nursing Homes and in their own homes without recourse to their care givers. In my own case I found this happening and when I discovered I was very upset. As a result I removed my wife from a 'Home' I took control by discontinued all medication. My expressed the was, view that too often the answers to problems were tackled by a ""sticking a plaster"" solutions, instead of tackling the underlying causes. Imagine my shock to discover while watching the late evening news to find my worst fears confirmed. A Government ordered review had found that about 145,000 people with dementia are wrongly being prescribed powerful anti-psychotic medication which cause around 1,800 deaths a year! These drugs are administered for: agitation, aggression, wandering and shouting. I have said before on this site ""If someone put me in a Nursing Home against my will, I sure as hell would be aggressive and agitated as for wandering; I'd run away as fast as my feet could carry me."" In my wife's final five years there were times she had to be rushed to hospital and on each occasion I insisted on taking her home as soon as she was treated, often against doctor's advice. I'd be scared to stay in hospital if I could still walk; I'd be inclined to escape! How much more so a scared an AD patient would feel in that situation? Hi Lyn, I'm pleased to learn that Cait is there for you. Our daughter Colleen is and has been my rock through these trying years. I wish you well and may your God go with you. Padraig","Snowy, From what I understand, you have a medical background and the best thing I believe is that you retain control of your life as best as you can. You are doing a wonderful job in helping others on this site. Saturday morning I received a copy in the post of the the meeting of the Officers of the Royal College of Psychiatrists of Old Age with Members of the Alzheimer's Society, held on 2nd June. It concerned the report on the use of anti-psychotics in dementia. It recommended that their use should be reviewed regularly and they should be gradually reduced and stopped whenever the patients' condition allows it. Your first hand knowledge of this mind stealing illness can prove of great benefit to many people. I notice that my Book is now available through the Net by keying in Dare to Dream - Padraig ID 66393. I'm not taking any money from it. If any aspect of our story helps that will be payment in itself. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Snowy, You have so much to offer as you are uniquely placed both from a medical and sufferer's point of view. There are times I feel so helpless and sad when I read of the total lack of understanding the fears and frustrations of loved ones suffering with AD. I spent a good deal of time fighting the system on behalf of my wife and in the end gave up and decided to manage on my own. People appear to accept the written word as it relates to the different 'stages'. Had I accepted what doctors and others told me my wife would have died at least four and a half years earlier than she did. No only that, she would have had an unnecessary painful death. I still feel very strongly about the way sufferers are being treated and miss understood, that is why I wrote our story, in the hope that some care givers receive a different perspective of how their loved ones feel. Emotions are the last of the senses we lose on death. How I wish people could better understand that fact. Keep up the good fight you have a lot to offer to help care givers better understand the patient's perspective. May your God go with you. Padarig


 Oh my friend how good it is to hv contact ..i hope to get you on msn so we can chat..thanks for the valuable info..luvs lyn...we shared alot of your care giving techniques..i will be reading your story..i hv missed our talks my friend...luvs and blessings...lyn


 Snowy, it doesn't....I believe this is a spammer trying to sneak their wares in with their signatures. I alert ed the administrator.


 Hoping you do read this my friend i have missed you very much lyn


 I'm very picky about the meds I'm given & refuse many.I do take Galentimine(Razadyne) but that's it.I did take seroquel for a time & it worked but the next time it caused me breathing problems so I quit that.....Thank heaven I still know whats going on & can tell the Dr yes or no about medications.........


 Yes I was a CNA licensed with the state of Texas for many years nearly 40.... Many people don't know how to react with someone with dementia,it's like ""Oh she has no idea what she's saying"".Yes I do STILL!!! I have my days though...... Thanks for the complement we don't get many of those.......


 Once again I see it being reported on the TV news that a survey shows that 75% of carers are unhappy at the treatment their loved ones with dementia receive in hospitals. It is reported that they are kept in hospital much longer than other patients with similar problems. This in turn speeds up their their illness. The report also reveals that 55% of nurses know little or nothing about the treatment or care of AD patients. This is very upsetting news to me because it is nine years since my late wife had a fall from which she broke her arm and walked into hospital. A month later she was released in a wheelchair unable to walk. During her stay I was in constant conflict with the staff. As I now reflect, it's no wonder I chose to reject any 'help' and decided to care for her on my own till her passing. My story is now available by logging in: Authorhouse.com Dare to Dream. I sincerely hope that those who reads it benefit from my experiences. May your God go with you. Padraig


 True but what has that got to do with Alzheimer's??

I have visited her daily but only recently have been able to talk to her she had a slight stroke, and Hypoxia due to advanced Emphazema and Neumonia which we didn t know she had and I have been taking her to her Dr appts and her Dr never mentiones she had this My question is she seems altered mentally, some times she is knowledgeable about her situation and who her family is and other times when I talk to her she is confused and don t reconize me as her son which is very upsetting the Dr tells me when she is released she will most certainly need to gointo a nursing home which I don t want at all I told him I will look after her and hire a nurse or aid to help with medical issues and personal hygene etc to that he is not impressed and obviously dosn t agree with this but I don t want and will not just put her in one of these homes and here in Ontario Canada tyheir have been many investigations into these places and charges against the staff and owners I actually live in Europe not Canada anymore but I will and can financially and personally mve back and look after her Is this dementia/Alzheimers can it be a tempory condition which can resolve itself What if anything can I personally do to help to improve this mental state And is me planning to care for my Mom myself a incorrect decission and should I listen to the Dr s Obviously due to this being a almost sudden situation I don t know much to anything about caring for someone with these issues so please any advise help or information would be very welcome and helpfull Sincerely Bruce Ontario Canada","Alzheimer's is not a temporary disease.....I have vascular dementia it is slower but the end is the same........Just keep on keeping on.........


 I hope that someone with more knowledge will post. I will hope with you that it is a temporary problem. If she had a stroke, then it seems that it would have an effect. Problems with strokes can often be overcome. Best of luck to you! Stacey

Ativan - Alzheimer's,Ativan is NOT a good medication for anyone with Alzheimer's.It can make them worse.,"I took Aricept for 4 yrs.I have been on Reminyl the last 3.The only anitdepressant I take is Remeron,BUT I have Seroquel as a PRN (as needed)medication.My Primary experimented with different meds with me,I got sick,losing 15 lbs in a very short time. I realised then I needed a Neurologist,the Primary didn't know what he was doing.He's a good Dr.BUT not for Alzheimer's. I was a CNA for 30 yrs.I still know what's what,even after 8 yrs........ My Neurologist supports me with the way I take my meds..........


 Yes I am.I was diagnosed in 1996


 AtivaORHaldolNOT THE BEST FOR THE ELDERLY WITH ad IT CAN MAKE symptoms worse


 Ativan is usually RX for anxiety and stress.......... As We said ( snowy and I) NOT good for AD ppl


 Thanks Snowy I TOTALLY AGREE


 Thanks for your post hun I have worked and owned a home where at the beginning YES ativan was pushed to much by the doc ......it became noticeable that the residents in my Retirement home and Nursing Homes I worked in that ATIVAN would and could cause more combative and aggressive behaviour ........ After seeing this for more that 30 odd yrs it became more of a ongoing battle with docs and proving the theory BUT theory was proved and many ( not all ) ..but majority were taken off ATIVAN and put on another med .......... Depends on the person .....IMHO.Just my half cents worth.


 I too worked over 30 yrs.im hosp.NH & private homes.Some Drs just don't get it.Some even order Haldol,OMG that's a nightmare...........


 Haldol is a NIGHTMARE you are so right Snowy I remember having being on it for not long and was a total zombie ....sure nuff got off that .....cannot imagine what it would do to our seniours with AD..........


 I totally agree toi have them complacecent is one thing and not combative BUT research does show that ativan and haldol are not indicated for Alzheimers ppl.....there are many other meds you mentioned Zyprexna which I would choose over the ativan anytime I think it is a personal choice as well as seeing how loved ones react.......being involved in their tx plan as well Take care LYN


 I have made my point with the ativan and I guess it is up to each to do the same


 I am off of an Alzheimer's diagnosed case, because they refused to accept my observations while administering Ativan to my patient. I am trained in the Field of Alzherimer's, and am also Med. Certified. Upon entering the situation in the home, I went directly to the medications that were prescribed to my new patient. I found conflicting drugs. Ativan, and RemRon. Ambien and Lunesta. the latter have very serious side effects when used in conjunction with each other. I accompanied my patient, and her family to her Physician. I explained my observations of the patient, after taking Ativan for agitation. She began to have tremors, or what appeared to be restless legs. She had skin tears on her shins, from her recent stay at a skilled nursing facility before coming home. She was on a regimen of anti-depressants, blood pressure medication to keep the blood lowered. I assume their diagnoses of Alzheimer's was a Vascular Dementia. Her Doctor insisted on administering Ativan for what they call "" Sun-downing"" A catch all phrase. After approximately 30 hours of episodes of crying, and other behaviors, non stop. The night Caregiver left immediately, stating he couldn't bare to see her suffer.( He panicked and felt helpless). I helped her son take her to the Emergency ward of a nearby Hospital. Immediately after our arrival to ER, she became very calm and lucid. I described to the attending Physician my observations of my patient,while taking Ativan. At approximately 4:00 in the morning, the Dr. ordered an injection of slow acting Ativan, the drug of choice for Alzheimer's. Within one half hour, my patient had severe tremors, and the Cardiac Monitor showed her heart rhythm all over the charts. The decision to give her the Ativan, was supported by her family Dr., as well as the ER Dr. She was climbing out of bed, off the walls and having a major Neuronal Glitch. I feel that once a Dr. has diagnosed a patient with Alzheimer's, he/she is given Carte Blanche to use this Patient as their own personal Guinea Pig. Finding an above board Dr. is the most important factor. One of the reasons for Conflict of Medication is the process of ordering and receiving them. Each time a Dr. orders, and then cancels a new drug, it is up to the Caregiver/family, to place the discontinued medication in a safe place. If a mail-order company is late in getting a medication to a patient, and the Dr. sends a Prescript ion to a Pharmacy, then these two companies have no protocol for alert ing the Caregiver of the conflict of medication. Not knowing the other is filling the conflicting Prescript ion. It is up to the Dr. to control the medication, and to keep the family informed of all changes that conflict with each other. Hope this info. helps you in your decisions on Medication. This has to be the toughest job you can encounter in your life. Peace be with you.


 Has anyone heard of Ativan being prescribed to an Alzheimer's patient? Is this necessary if he is already taking Seroquel as well? Any advice would be so greatly appreciated. Sincerly, danicamo


 Really, because my father in law is being prescribed Arricept (which I realize from much research is for Alzheimer's), Seroquel, and Ativan. To me...and of course by no means am not a doctor...he seems to be over medicated. Within a two week period (he is in a Protective Care facility) he has lost control of everything. He can barely walk, can not talk, can not feed himself, and has fallen 3 times. I am terribly perplexed and am not sure what to do next. Do you have a family member who has this disease? Thank you for your reply.


 Are you diagnosed with Alzhemiers?


 Ativan doens't work for all patients. For some patients can have the opposite efect. But on the other hand, for some patients is good. Seroquel can make the patient sleepy too. You need to talk to the doctor, and maybe he needs to readjust the doses or stop one of them. Good luck


 I like Snowy have worked with the Elderly for many yrs until retirement ....... Ativan is not indicated for AD patients but some docs do RX it ....... I had my Mom taken off of it due to falling and aggitation ....amongst other problems I believe caused by the ativan ........


 Any of the BENZO.medications are not indecated for anyone with dementia or AD.They can & will cause problems in the long haul.Even the next day or 2 after taking them they can get out of hand.


 That's funny. I am certainly not disagreeing with anyone here, but I have worked in nursing homes specifically with Alzheimer's patients for around 7 years, and Ativan was the primary drug we would give them when they would become very confused, combative, and in any way irate. I guess it depends on the doctor, and in many cases, when working in the nursing homes, the residents seem to have the same doctors...at least in my case. So, if I were first to answer this question, I definately would have said I think Ativan is a good drug for Alzheimer's patients, as to me, it's one of the only drugs I have seen used. Just wanted to add my 2 cents!


 Funny how different things can actually be from home to home, ya know?


 Funny that you mention Haldol...that is another drug I am familiar with.


 I'm working in residential care facility for the elderly and most of our residents are Alzheimers. Yes, Seroquel(sometime Zyprexa} and Ativan (Lorazepam) are usually prescribed with Alzheimers when they are agitated and combative. The reaction varies. Some become better and back, some become even worse and there are those who become zombie, it's really bad. The staff of the facility who usually take them to their doctor's appointment usually complain that this resident is restless, agitated, combative and does not sleep at night, then the doctor will prescribed this medication to calm them down and to keep them quiet. This usually happen when your loved one is in the facility. This is for their advantage, It's better to have a resident who's quiet, seated in the wheelchair the whole day,than a resident who wanders, screaming and combative.


 Zyprexa and Seroquel are psychotic medicine. Zyprexa has less side effect than Seroquel but it's an expensive medicine.Haloperidol is an old medicine for anxiety and has horrible side effect. Ativan is prescribed for anxiety,agitation, restlessness and difficulty in breathing. That's why it is also given to hospice to calm them and to relieve them in shortness of breathing. It is also prescribed for those who has sundown symdrome. These are the medicine given with AD. Aricept for memory retention, and forthe earlystage of AD,they are given: Namenda, excelon or low dose of Zyprexa. Usually it is accompanied by anti-deppressant medicine like Xanax, Prosac, Zoloft,Risperdal, it depend to the needs of individual. And because Alzhiemers change their sleeping pattern, they wander at night and sleep at day time they are given sleeping pills like Trazodone, Ambien, Klonopin, Remeron or Ambien. There's a lot of medicines regarding this disease but these are the most common prescribed. Some help but most of them not.


 Ativan I have been taking for my Anxiety I have just come to the TOTAL conclusion is the cause for all my probs with my memory loss and I have STOPPED taking it with doc in my TX plan .......... Just my opinion


 After being on many antidepressants some with no good results others with worse results I was put on Remeron.It was a life saver for me,but am now on the highest dose of it......45mg..........."
DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING AND HICCUPPING,"Hello, It has been a while since I last posted. My dad is 88 and was diagnosed with Alzheimers about 8 years ago. He is doing very well and can still live alone and do everything for himself except drive. I take care of him and go over to his house several times a day for about 4 to 5 hours. about 18 months ago he started having problems swallowing food. He said it felt like the food was caught in his throat. It happened maybe once every two months or so. The doctor said it was because he refused to get dentures and wasn't always chewing his food well. Recently it has gotten a lot worse. Now almost everytime he eats or takes his pills or even drinks a milkshake, he will start hiccupping and then gagging and vomitting up saliva (not the food) just saliva. It is horrible to watch. Sometimes it lasts for 10 to 15 minutes. He tells me it feels like the food (or pills) are stuck in his throat. Finally after 10 or 15 minutes the food ""goes down"" his throat and he feels better. I have researched this on the internet and found other people complaining of the same thing, but no one was able to tell them why it was happening. I know AD patients sometimes have swallowing problems especially in the late stages, but dad has no real symptoms of AD except severe short term memory loss. I am at my witts end. I have had him on a liquid diet for about 4 weeks but he still has this problem. It is not getting better. Does anyone have an idea what could be causing this? Thanks, Michele","His short term memory loss might be the reason that he doesn't chew his food well. I tried finding it online too but I couldn't find the why's either. It just says that in the end stage that AZ patients have a hard time swallowing (like you said). So maybe he is forgetting to chew well? Or maybe even on how to swallow? Swallowing is both a concious and nonconscious act. We swallow in our sleep because our body is telling us to do so and when we are awake, we make a concious effort to swallow liquids and food. But please keep an eye on him because the problem with the unability to swallow properly causes aspiration which in turn can cause pneumonia.


 Thanks so much for the advice. I will keep an eye on him. Michele


 Hi Alice, Thank you so much for responding. Your comments were very helpful and I am going to look into the ""Thick It"". The suggestions about how to swallow sound like they will really help Dad. I am curious about what you said about your DM being diagnosed with AD and then another doctor said she only had dementia. I have strongly felt for some time that Dad does not have AD. It has been 8 years and the only problem he has is with his short term memory and even then he can remember some short term events very clearly. When I asked the doctor about this he said everyone progresses differently. I agree with that statement, but seriously, in 8 years he has no other signs of AD. Every one else I know who was diagnosed with AD deteriorated within 3 to 5 years, i.e. not able to feed, bathe or dress themselves, not knowing their own children, etc. Does your DM only have memory problems or does she have other AD related problems? Do you think she has AD? It would be a great relief to me to know Dad doesn't have AD. Thanks for taking the time to respond. Michele


 Hi Alice, Thanks for taking the time to respond. It helps talking to someone who has been through the same things. Most people can't understand the stress we are under trying to care for a person with AD. There seems to be a new problem or crisis each day. They are always agitated or fixated about something, but I am blessed Dad can still live alone. Thanks for the information and tips. My dad has tried some of your suggestions (smaller sips and tip the chin down) and it has really helped him. He is doing so much better! Your DM and my dad have a lot in common with burning the food in the oven. I disconnected the oven a couple of years ago becasue I was afraid he would burn the house down. He hasn't missed it too much. Thanks again, Michele


 Hi there i too have dentures and so many times if alone i will eat certain foods w/o my dentures in i have not had troubles with this at all but that is me idk i personally think it requires more looking into but hey thats just my opinion i also hv a brother that for whatever reason wont wear dentures n he never has issues eating basically anything i am sure or relatively so that food is not digested properly due tp ;ack of complete chewing but again ive never hearfd of this maybe others have hoping you get better answers blessing lyn


 Great point Red huggs lyn wasnt quite awake but no excuse


 Hi Michele, My DM was orinally dx w/ AD, then another dr dx her w/ 'Dementia'. She has a problem w/ short term memory sometimes, but a big problem w/ swallowing. She choked on a peanut butter sandwich last yr. Thankfully, my sister was w/ her at the time, gave her the Heimlich (sp) and cleared the path. Scared all of us. She has had problems since then. She is in a rehab right now to recover from C-diff and pneumonia, she is 91 yrs old. While there, they had a speech therapist come in to observe her eat, talk, etc. The S/T sent her for a Video Swallow test at the hospital. This is the 2nd time she has had this done, 1st time wasn't too bad, this time she had more problems. She only wears the upper denture and she has Gastroparesis. They have taken to chopping her food very well. I've had the worse time trying to convince her to have her food this way at home. They have also added something called 'Thick-It' to ALL of her liquids, including water. These have helped tremendously to keep her from choking. The S/T also made some suggestions to help my DM. Keep your head facing straight ahead, and as you swallow, dip your chin slightly. Each time you swallow food/drink/saliva - swallow twice. Take smaller sips, bites. We have all noticed big improvements. It all comes down to being very 'mindful' of what you are doing. Focusing on all the steps of eating and drinking. I asked about the 'Thick-It', do we need a rx or can we pick it up OTC at the drug store? You can get it at w/o a rx at the drug store. My DM didn't like the 'Thick-It' to begin w/ but now she is used to it and it doesn't bother her. My DH has a problem w/ hiccups, he does not have AD. He eats very quickly, it does tend to bring on the hiccups, plus one food sets him off - Beef! I rarely cook beef anymore (I get sick just thinking of beef - long,weird story), so it isn't often that he has it. When I do fix it for him, he always ends up w/ the hiccups. Just wondering if there are certain foods that can trigger this for your father. I hope you both get some answers/help. I know it can be frightening for both of you. God bless. Alice.


 Hi Michele, I'm glad you found the suggestions helpful, hopefully, they will make things easier for the two of you. The dr who originally dx my DM w/ AD wasn't her regular dr. She was the one on call in the hosp when my was rushed there one time. She didn't know her at all and was rather snippy w/ my mother. Not a good idea! She was later dx w/ dementia by a neurologist. A lot of the symptoms are very similar. The dr believes this started when my DM had a stroke, which she had after coming home from the hospital to have her 1st pacemaker put in. She has a hard time w/ her bladder control. She never had that before. She held off using Depends for a long time. She had her own little Sr house, didn't want to live w/ anyone. about the time she had her 2nd pacemaker, she got extremely upset about living on her own. She does have Depression, anxiety, and no interest in meeting new ppl, the family is as much as she has interest in. She can't follow the steps for cooking anymore, would forget she had something in the oven or microwave, the smoke detector would go off and the fire truck would come. She was mortified. She gets stubborn about taking a shower, sometimes. My mother would read 5 newspapers a day, now not interested. Loved crossword puzzles and playing cards, now can't follow all the steps. She will repeat herself on occassions. She will tell you a story she told 1/2 hr ago, not all the time, she will even ask, 'Did I tell you that before?' She can't write for long, she used to have such beautiful handwriting, now very childlike. She hasn't been able to write cks or keep a ck book for awhile. She know all her children, in laws, grands and greats. She knows anniversaries and b/d for children, my DH and the grands - all 13 of them. She always remembers my phone #, I've had it for over 30 yrs and I can't change it - for the simple reason, it is the only # all my family can remember. lol I have a very dear friend (we were raised as cousins) her DM and my DM were BFF since grade school. This woman has been dx w/ AD and it is about 8 yrs w/ this dx. She is in worse shape than my mother. She is in her early 60's. She knows her children, but not sure of her grands. My DM is on Aricept, dr said either AD or vascular dementia would benefit from using this med. I know my mother was extremely upset to be told she has AD, but handled the dx of dementia much better. She can be extremely sharp and like her old self. Then she has days where she gets confused, not all day but for periods of a day. If you and your father aren't sure or comfortable w/ the dx, maybe another evaluation would help to define what is going on w/ your father. Maybe another dr, neurologist or such. I wish you luck w/ your father. He is lucky to have such a loving daughter in his corner. You are both in my thoughts and prayers. God bless. Alice."
Alzheimer's Survey - Need Responses From Caretaker and Patient,"**permission for this post has been attained from founder Peter Waite Dear Mild or Moderate Alzheimer's Patients and Caretakers, Hello I am an undergraduate biomedical researcher at the UC Irvine Medical Center, asking if you can fill out my surveys (contained in the link at the bottom) for mild or moderate Alzheimer's patients and their caretakers. My study was approved by the Institutional Review Board on June 10th, 2009 (IRB#2009-6884). My supervisor is Rimal Bera, M. D. I issue these surveys in pairs- one for the caretaker and the other for the AD patient- since I must compare your responses to assess awareness of chronic pain. I want my results to allow others to draw meaningful conclusions, hopefully removing some of the struggles that Alzheimer's patients and caretakers experience every day. These surveys take ~20 minutes to complete and there is no follow-up. I have done my best to protect patient and caretaker privacy- I never record the name of the patient or the caretaker, and questions are answered with brief responses/scales/checked boxes. Please read over the ""Reminder of the qualifications"" in the link below. If applicable, proceed to the caretaker and patient surveys that follow (both of you must be present to complete your surveys). I will provide $20 to each caretaker-patient pair that completes the entire survey. Please make sure to indicate, in the box at the beginning of the survey, which means of compensation you would like. Here is the link: http://www.kwiksurveys.com/online-survey.php?surveyid=LBJNN_e8afd4e9 Thank you for your consideration! Sincerely, Matthew Keating","Wow thank you for bringing up this idea! I cannot think of a way to redirect the $20 to a donation for Alzheimer's awareness (definitely open to suggestions), beyond simply promising that I will donate $20 to an AD society of your choosing. However I would feel comfortable sending the donation to the Washington University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, since they offer to send a notification letter to individuals (i.e. I would verify each donation by having a notification letter sent to the respective participants). Please indicate your desire for such a donation in the first text box on the survey. Another option is to receive my payment and subsequently make a donation on your own. Forums made possible by HealingWell.com allow for incredibly supportive feedback among AD patients and caretakers, far beyond providing opportunities to recruit participants for research (but believe me I have nothing but good intentions!). So why not reinforce this support with a small donation? Yet another option, I like how the Alzheimer's Association donor site allows you to search for your employer when you donate; certain employers will match the donation thus doubling its impact (oftentimes the minimum donation to match is $25 so I will send this amount if you indicate your intent at the beginning of your survey). Here are the links to donate: HealingWell.com: click on Donate at the top of your screen Alzheimer's Association: https://act.alz.org/site/Donation2?1760.donation=form1&idb=932446963&df_id=1760 Washington University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center: http://alzheimer.wustl.edu/about _Us/Donate.htm But whatever you do, know that we will beat Alzheimer's Disease!


 i believe your intentions are sincere so i have no problem with donating funds to Alzheimers society i live in Canada and here the numbers are sky rocketing with our seniors..this is a very sad n lonely dd no way should our elders have to go thru this with all they have done for us imho lyn


 So very well stated and so true..thank you for your interest in helping our loved ones caregivers and relatives..friends respectfully lyn plz feel free to email me as well


 hi just saw this again will respond tomorrow how do i donate he money thru you to ad society..i think they really need money for more awareness ..jmho..lyn


 i think this is great and my prayers are we do beat this dd soon...lyn


 It's inspiring to hear your perspective on Alzheimer's. Not only do you see suffering put into words on this Alzheimer's forum, but you are also surrounded by it where you live. Yet it won't bring you down. Could not agree more from my limited experiences with AD in my family, my friends' families, and inside clinics- no one deserves to go through this, whether it be those with AD or their caretakers and relatives."
rembering my momma and saying hi,i don't know if yaw rember me and momma. she passed away over a year ago now. i still miss her so much and love her. she was so sweet. anyways i wanted to say hi. i'll be hanging out in the depression and bipolor rooms. take care of yourselves.,"Are you okay hun thinking about you huggs lyn


 Hi sweetie yes i remember you n i am so sorry bout your momma i know how it feels i hv lost both parents to this dd stay posting to let us know how you are doing huggs lyn"
She won't listen to me,I need help please. I struggle daily to get my mom to allow me to take her PJ's off in the morning to change her into street clothes. When I try to pull her tops up she pulls it down. When I try to take her pants off she pulls it up or grabs it for dear life. The elastic on her waistbands is on it's last leg. When I take her to the restroom she won't sit on the toilet. I try to push her to sit down and she stands firmly in front of it. When I try to take her pants down she pulls it back up just like when I try to change her. She has about 1 bowel movement a week and I know she holds it in on purpose. Many times she would be sitting on the sofa for hours and the moment I take her to the restroom she would go like a light switch which I don;t think is a coincidence. IT's just that she felt it was time to go. She also holds her urine in for hours at a time. When she does finally go she ends up going in her diaper. Last weekend it leaked out while she was asleep because she slept on her side and it came out. I ended up doing the laundry at 4 in the morning to wash everything that was covered in pee. I then dragged her to take a shower because she was just covered in it from her lower back and downward. I am getting so tired and frustrated with her lack of support that I'm starting to get panic attacks each time I take her to the restroom. She won't tell me if she needs to pee or poop so it's all a guessing game for me. Any suggestions? What can I do to make her cooperate with me? We spend hours in the bathroom nightly before bed hoping that she could pee before hand so I wouldn't feel the need to take her at 1 in the morning which I have been doing each night and then once more before she finally gets up at 6:00 am. She tends to have more urine in the middle of the night for some reason. I've been getting up at least 3 times a night for over 5 years now and I've lost the ability to sleep through the night. I only nap. I get paranoid that she will get up and wander around and mess with things so I constantly wake up even though she's sleeping soundly.,"Oh Bella33, my heart goes out to you. You are such a wonderful daughter to do all that for her. Have you called home health? Don't if you have to have insurance or what, but they helped with baths, etc when my grandmother was in bad health. Surely there is an Alzheimer's helpline you could call for more help. Hang in there - lots of Luvs


 You seem to have a huge heart. I hate that your sis is only around every 3 months. At least you have a sibling. My brother died in a diving accident at 17 yrs old - long time ago - I'm 48. Both of my parents are still going strong, but (74 and 83) I am saddened when I think about having to one day take care of them. My grandmother lived to see 100. Is Alzheimer's always genetic - no one in my family has ever had that. My family fears cancer - runs on both sides. Terri


 I have fibromygia so I can definitely hop on the pharmaceutical bandwagon!! I know I pay for their houses, cars, etc. I don't know how you are caring for your mom and other family members. As for your selfish siblings, I firmly believe the ""what goes around, comes around"". I also believe you will have many jewels in your crown in Heaven and God will reward you for a ""job well done"". Just keep your faith and pray often. He does hear our cries. I have many stories that I have experienced when I was at my ropes end and prayed my heart out. At one point I thought He had deserted me (my ultimate low point). A small miracle happened (I know, I was there) and I knew He had never left me. It was His way of letting me know He hadn't forgotten me. Pray for peace and strength, Bella33, He also is a good listener when you need to talk. I've heard so many stories like yours where only one sibling is the caretaker - you are the strong one, the family leader. I hope I am as strong as you when it comes time for me to change roles with my parents. You are truly a gem!!! God bless you. Terri


 I have an Aunt like your sister - she is a minister. She too would rather help everyone else but her family. Please don't profile Christians by your sister and my Aunt. We all sin, but I'd rather pay for my own sins than theirs (leaders in the church that turn people away by others watching their own actions). Just remember they are human also and will too stumble and fall and have to answer to God for their own actions. I haven't been to church in a while mainly due to my illness so I'm not a Bible-screaming Christian. I DO BELIEVE in a personal relationship, however. Don't let your sister keep you from praying. She too will have to answer severely for her selfishness. Just remember, you are a wonderful person!! Maybe you should remind your sister about her faux-Christian attitude. All the best.


 I feel the same way - by the way, you can baptize someone until they nearly drown. Baptizing itself doesn't make you a ""Christian"". Don't believe your sister has gotten that part. Anyhoo, enough of that. You hang in there girl. Wish I could help you - I live in south Louisiana. I'm sure a long way from you. Its funny how, no matter where one lives, we all are fighting with illnesses that no one seems to understand or have a cure!!! Guess we all need to encourage each other! Hope your days get easier for you. I'm going to talk to my mom about who she contacted for help with my grandmother and will let you know what she said. Maybe we can get you some help SOMEHOW. All the best, Bella33. Many hugs for you.


 Hi Bella, I can only imagine what you are going through with your mom. You are a real loving daughter to take care of her in her state of mind. To let you know my mom was diagnosed in 2001 with Alzheimer Disease or similar and after 3 years of my dad and a local community centre couldn't handle her anymore, they had to admit her to a long term facility. She was on the Alzheimer's floor for most of the time until a fall she had from running through the hallways. She thought she was a child again and could run. She didn't know what she was doing though. She was placed in a wheelchair and moved up to the main floor. I struggled seeing her deteriorate before my eyes and couldn't bare to visit her as often as I should have. But unfortunately she passed away in December 2009 from an infection that took over all of her organs and shut it down. If she had not got the infection, she would've still been alive with Alzheimers! She was so friendly, loving, never violent even with her disease. I totally know how hard it is. My mom was like yours at the beginning, she fought, argued, woke in the middle of the night numerous times, almost left the house in the middle of the night. She was fighting what was happening to her, and all we could do was do our best to help her. I hope things work out for you and whatever you decide, i've been there also. All the best and take care!! It's hard to see someone we love so dear suffer like they are with such a horrible disease. I know, i'm still dealing with the mourning process. It's really hard, and being it's a MOM.....it's only that much harder. Need to talk, let me know :)


 I am very sorry for you losing your mother in Dec. I was crying while reading your posting. I am just terrified. How does anyone live a normal life? When I watch TV and see people stressing over their jobs or relationships I often wonder don't they have ill family members to watch over? I just assume everyone has my life story. Very naive I know.


 It may be time to just let her ""go"" in a diaper. Yes it may be messier but it might help you in the long run, mentally. It sounds like she is using the restroom stubborness as a way to hang onto control. She may be feeling that all the control in her life is gone but this is the ONE thing she can still do something about . As for her going more in the middle of the night, have you tried withholding liquids a few hours prior to bedtime? If you are paranoid about her wandering, try putting large and loud bells on her bedroom door so you can hear it if she opens her door to wander.


 One thing to keep an eye on is if she keeps retaining her urine, it can lead to a urinary tract infection. She may not be able to tell you about it so every once in a while, have her urine tested if you don't already do so. And you are so right about it being hard on the caretakers. I know it must be hard on them too to lose themselves but the ones around them are being torn to shreds because they are forced to watch someone they love become a shell of who they were.


 Does she like cranberry juice? If she does, this can help prevent UTI's or even treat them (as long as it is not severe and gone to the kidneys).


 Hmm cranberry juice always seems to work for me when I get UTI's unless I let them go for too long. There are studies that prove that cranberry juice kills whatever causes a UTI if taken early enough. My daughter too has stopped a couple of UTI's by drinking it. Yes docs DO like to prescribe those meds don't they? I am not complaining because many of those prescript ions keep me healthy but I just wish they were a little open minded about alternative options.


 i agree with Red i made sure mom always had cranberry juice and i also had to put bells up in case she wandered...i hv lost both parents and recently i totally lost my own memory do to seizure and other complications...yes it is frustrating for caregivers but i have felt the other end of the spectrum n i was scared felt so alone n really didnt want to be a burden on my daughter..i am now deaf as well...i was a geriatric nurse for many many years so you can see why this was difficult for me..they cannot help much of what goes on but i am sure you are tryng your best it is not easy but we are here for support n input ..lyn ALSO It ripped my daughters heart out to see me as i was i have become much stronger remember more but still have bad days....lyn..perhaps when she is on toilet run the tap n see if that may jog her to piddle..idk just trying to suggesst different ideas....


 I forgot to mention that she does the same thing when I try to give her a shower. So.... she only gets one once a week. It's ok in the winter but when summer comes I don't know how that will work out. My whole body hurts from struggling with her and I still work a full time job. I don't know how much more I can do. I threaten to take her to the nursing home all the time but either she doesn't understand what I'm saying to her or she just doesn't care. She shows no fear.


 I have a helper who picks my mom up from the daycare center and stays with her until I get home from work which is about 3 hours a day. My mom will not let her shower her. I wish she would so my life would be so much more simpler. My older sister comes around maybe once every 3 months and both of us each get soaking wet when we shower her because she moves around a lot and the water just drips everywhere. I try to baby my mom and ask her if she feels good after she takes one and she always smiles and says yes but unfortunately she forgets and we struggle all over again the next time around. I give her the full treatment. She gets lotion rubbed all over her when she's done and then she takes a nap afterwards so what's not to like right? I should be so lucky to have someone give me a shower like that.


 I actually have 2 older brothers too. I'm the youngest believe it or not and I'm the one that's doing the care taking. One brother has a heart condition and I'm paying his expenses while the other is totally into his own family so I hope he ends up in hell for his lack of support with us. My sister who is the oldest and does not work because she doesn't need to told me years ago that if I ask her to take my mom off my hands she will send her to a home instead so I'm stuck. I refuse to do this and live with my decision at the end. I KNOW my mom will die very soon if she's sent to one. She's very dependent on me and probably vice versa. I'm alone and do not have a significant other. So in a way I feel alone. It is always a burden either way to have aging parents. I wish we can all die in our sleep just prior to getting a disease that can't be cured which by the way is every kind out there. Don't get me started on the pharmaceutical companies. You know we will never have a cure for anything because they will go out of business if we the consumers don't keep buying their meds to keep going.


 I have a co-worker whose wife also has fibromygia and he's her caretaker and it's taking a toll on him. But men... they can't take this kind of pressure like us women. I told him at least his wife can think and communicate her needs to him which is more than I can say for my mom. My sister is a big time Christian who rather do missionary work then care for her own mother. I'm sure GOD listens and perform miracles but I'm probably on a very long waiting list. I don't know how much longer I can wait. Thanks for your pep talk though. It's very comforting and helpful. Take care.


 Yes I know. My sister has been trying to get me baptized for years but I believe in my own God and not be forced to follow their ways. She doesn't see what she's doing as selfish because she sees the big picture that she's helping so many children in impoverished countries to become Christians and spread the word of God. She creates a Christmas letter aka Brag letter every Christmas of all the places she's been to for missionary work or just plain pleasure. (Pleasure will be 70% of that ) I'm sure the letters are just more exciting if she does that instead of ""I'm still caring for my mom daily...."" You can't change people. I've learned that the hard way. Everyone is selfish. I think it's human instincts to protect yourself first. I may seem to be so giving and all that but my mom is all I have so I'm just protecting my interest as well. My aunt reminded me that my mom took care of me as a child so this is payback. My aunt wasn't around when I was growing up so she doesn't know how I was brought up. Believe me, I've paid her back years ago already. My mom has lived a good life and is well taken care of by me. What will become of me when I get older? No one ever thinks of that right?


 Bella,try to get into a routine even when she fights you,just try again in ahile.........


 Well... I took her to the toilet an hour ago. She rubbed her stomach to indicate that it was full and she was ready to go. She was about to sit and pulled down her own underwear when all of a sudden she jerked it back up. I then got anxious and pulled them down for her which is when she struggled with me yet again. I kept telling her to sit down first and she kept saying ""ok ok"" but is standing up. I then got really mad and yelled at her which was a big mistake because I know it means she will hold in her urine which is what she did. She sat there for 30 more minutes and then I put a diaper on her and walked away for a minute. When I got back she was pulling her diaper apart which got me even more frustrated. I then pulled her up from the toilet and put her to bed. When she doesn't pee before she goes to bed means to me that I will have to take her again in a few hours which means another sleepless night for me. She seemed so normal today after I got back from work. The caretaker said she peed at 4 and was fine. I then took her to pee before dinner at 6:30 but after that it went downhill. Everyone keeps asking me what's next for me. I don't know honestly. If I send her to a home I will not visit ever because it will kill me to see her there and not have her be with me. I expect to be in a great depression as the disease progresses. There is not a solution to this. No therapy in the world can heal my pain. I do pray everyday for a miracle but.... yeah there's always tomorrow.


 Totally! I never did what you are doing, taking care of her at home. My dad did for 3 years and it was torture on him, with her fighting, struggling and constant battles. She was not like that in normal state nor was she like that in Alzheimers stage while at the home. My dad took early retirement to be with her to travel, but that didn't happen, she needed care 24/7. I'm sorry to have made u cry. I cry when I type about my mom even to this day, and when i talk to other's about her. Really, I kept it all in to myself, thinking no one can help me deal with this and what she is going through. They don't understand unless they have someone go through it. I'm sorry your mom is doing these things when you are trying to help her. It is extremely tough. And it will get harder, since they will be dependant on you full time for everything. While my mom was in the home, I fed her lunch sometimes or her snack and it broke my heart to feed her like she used to feed me as a child. Wiping her mouth and so on. That's why I couldn't go often to visit her. It tore me apart so badly to be in that position, when really she should be still caring for me. It's not an easy ordeal to go through, I'll tell ya that right now. It's the toughest thing to do, and the worst disease anyone should have to go through. Would never wish it on anybody. The pain and sorrow you feel and you really can't change or reverse it at all which is even harder on you emotionally and physically. I always wished I could cure my mom and bring her home again, I knew that wasn't possible and now i'm suffering terribly, missing her so much more everyday. Time is supposed to heal, but for me, I don't think it ever will. I am the only girl and the baby of the family so it's taking its toll on me for sure. Plus my mom had a difficult pregnancy with me, dying on the delivery table, then being revived to be told it was a girl (me). She was revived and saw me grow and marry, but I never gave her all that I could while she was at home, healthy. Anyway, things will be different for you, thats for sure. Your life will be anything but normal, especially with your kindness of taking care of your mom. I couldn't bear to do what you are doing, i would be more of a wreck than I already am. Keep strong!!


 My mom is fully capable of eating by herself but she doesn't finish up which means I end up feeding her half way through. She is easily distracted and plays with her napkin or puts half eaten food on the table instead of her own plate. That's the perfect word to describe my mom, distracted. She's peed on the carpet in her bedroom many times because she gets up from bed with the intention to go to the bathroom but always find something else to do on her way there. The mind may wander but her bladder is still focused so... she pees where ever she happens to be standing at the time because she can't hold it any longer. I've been sleeping with her the last few weeks. It's just easier for me to keep tabs on her instead of coming and going out of my bedroom to check on her. I wake up constantly through out the night because I'm used to this sleeping pattern now. Yes I know it's a control thing with her when she pees or not pee. It's ok to wear the diaper now when its still cold but I'm concerned about heat rashes in the summertime. It takes her a long time to pee from the time she drinks anything. Case in point, she can drink some water along with her dinner but there is no pee before bed at 8:30. Last night I got her up at 3 and she peed a lot. The daycare center discourages her from wearing a diaper because they want her to pee in the toilet and be independent of a diaper. Also she is less likely to let them help her pull her pants down when she's wearing one for some reason. So, I only have her wear one before bed. The times she had peed on the carpet was earlier in the year before I started her wearing it. Alzheimer is the only disease I know of that affects the caretakers more so then the patient. So, my mother is very lucky in that aspect. I will keep her with me as long as I still have a heartbeat. I may even quit my job in the end to stay with her full time if need to and find a way to survive. I was an accident baby. My mom already had 3 children 2 years apart from each other and then she got pregnant with me 4 years later after my brother was born which was a big problem because all the baby stuff was already thrown out. My grandfather told my mom not to abort me and someday she will thank him for that. Yeah, thanks grandpa. One last concern I have is her lack of cooperation when it comes to taking her medication. She constantly keeps them in her mouth or she chews them up like candy. Again it's control thing. I tell her to swallow and.... she doesn't.


 My sister was more concerned of her kidneys. She used to get UTI all the time and it's a catch 22. When she takes anti-biotics she gets really really confused. I try to make sure she's clean down there. Although she only showers 2 times a week I make sure her underwear is changed daily and I wipe for her when she's done in the restroom. I wish Obama would speed things along on a cure for this disease. Too much time wasted on health care reform. I think the only way to make this personal for him is to have someone in his immediate family to get it. The founder of Google has PD so... he's spending a ton of $ for research for the cure. More rich people need to get this because money talks.


 Yes she drinks it daily. She's pre-diabetic from her last blood test result so I have to watch her fruit juice intake. Funny thing is that her family doctor said cranberries does nothing for UTI. MD's only know drugs.


 Most of my cousins are MD's so they've told me firsthand that they know very little about alternative medicines. After all only pharmaceutical reps go to visit and push their drugs right? Also in Med school they don't concentrate on that either. They're just ignorant on that subject. I tried giving my mom Turmeric capsules supplement to help her brain out. It actually worked wonders for about a week but then she stopped peeing. I later realized that it has anti-inflammatory properties so that will cause urinary retention. So I had to stop."

Information about my mother's condition,"Hi there, my name is Cody. The reason that I joined this forum and am posting this topic, is I need help. Five years ago, when I was thirteen, my mother became very ill. She was only able to hold down one or two bites of food before puking. After almost a month, she went to the hospital, with malnutrition and vitamin deficiency. They put her on an IV and within 24 hours, the hospital we took her to had literally filled my mother with so much fluid, she was three times her size, and I assure you, I am not exagerating. Her heart stopped, and was put on life support for 3 days. Within three days, she was able to breathe on her own, but for the first month after this whole situation, while staying in the hospital, had no memory of my father, myself, or my little brother. Once we were able to bring her home, her memory started to come back. Now, five years later, she is worse. Her mental capabilities are so bad, she can start a sentence, and within two words forget. And this is a very common situation now. She forgets absolutely everything. She will get up in the middle of the night, turn on the oven to cook, and come wake me because she had wondered into my room and forgotten where she was. Atleast three times a day, she asks me what day it is, or where she is, or what she had been doing before this. She was doing so good for awhile, that we thought we were in the clear. But then, she started getting worse, and it hasn't gotten any better. Could she possibly have Alzheimer's? I am confused on the situation, and I am just reaching out for help. Any kind of help would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Cody I took out your last name for security reasons. Post Edited By Moderator (Red_34) : 5/28/2010 5:20:21 AM (GMT-6)","Getting her to a good Nuerologist ASAP would help........


 Regardless if she has no insurance, I believe she should get to the neurologist ASAP. It sort of sounds like she is having mini strokes.


 That's great to hear that you are trying to save up the money to help your mother. What if you were to call one up and see if you can make some sort of payment arrangements with them? There were times in the past that I didn't have the money either but if I called in advance and see if they would work with me, they would. Good luck and please let us know how your mother is doing ok?


 Hi Cody, welcome to Healingwell :) I am so sorry to hear about what you and your mother are going thru :( How old is your mother? Has she ever seen a neurologist for her memory loss? Has there been any indication she had a stroke? Is she on any medications at this time? I'm sorry for all the questions, but this might give us a clearer picture.


 Well, she doesn't have insurance, so the only medical tests she has gotten was a follow up at shands, but they say she was fine. My mother's shrink and regular doctor say she is indeed not right in the head, and she is very physically unhealthy. She is 49. She takes many prescript ion pills (which are prescribed to her) along with vitamins. She must take at least 20+ a day. I could not tell you any of them, because I have no idea what they are. However, when I get a chance, I will write them down on a list, and reply to this with the list. And actually the other day, for some odd reason, right after dinner, she was putting the tub of butter back in the fridge. When she grabbed it, her legs bent, she twisted to the right, her arms clung to her chest and bent in an odd shape, she cocked her head to the right, and pretended as if nothing had happened. She immediately fell, and I was luckily standing behind her. This was three days ago. In the last five days, I have told her to try to exercise a little, but to stay in bed most of the day. Ever since this happened, her memory has become worse, and she cannot stand up for more than a minute by herself, without having to lean on something. She is always paler than a ghost, and has a hard time eating.


 We have actually tried to get her to a neurologist. We just simply cannot afford it. But, I am trying to save up some money to get her to a neurologist.


 She is still having memory problems. Only seems like it is getting worse, but I will call ahead of time. Thank you for the advice. I will let you know how it goes!"
Daddy died,Just wanted to let everyone know that my Daddy died last Friday the 26th at 8:00 am. He didn't make it but a week at home. He was ready to die. He told me two days after he came home that he wanted to die. The death was the most horrible thing that I have ever witnessed. It was so scary. I don't know if I could ever do it again. I miss my Daddy so much. I know that he is a better place and not suffering anymore though. Dorsey's daughter,"Thank you so much for your kind words. Dorseys daughter

Ok heres the latest venting,"I work on laundry after patient goes to bed. I didn't hear patient get up. I walk baack in and get cussed out, called prosatute (sp? sorry I cant think of how it spelled), more words upon that last word, patient said they were telling everyone that I am having men over left and right. There was no cars in the driveway, no one over, and me in the laundry room working on laundry. It got so bad that patient told me to get the heck (not as nicely said) out, and I was not wanted there. So I cleverly grabbed my house key, and said ""Ok I will leave right now since I am not wanted here."" And I left. I stayed on property, well hidden, but full view of what happened in the house. We have a garage here, with a couch and boxes around it, but the boxes are just angled right to where you can see the windows of the house. So I went on the couch. I had my cell phone, and the house key. I waited til patient went back to sleep and stayed out there til about 1am. about 4am, patient woke up again and came in my room to check on me. They do not remember what happened. But it sure made me mad. Did I do the best thing in that situation?","Female. My grandmother, however, I am paid by state due to my medical training. I kind of told my family over my dead body she'd go in a home without my efforts. I worked in a home before this, and on a different floor.


 As long as you could see what was going on in the house then I think what you did was fine. Sometimes it's best to go with the situation then to fight it. AZ patients are not in control of their emotions nor thoughts. So at that given moment, they wanted you out and would have steadfastedly insisted until the next moment in which they wanted you back. Is this a female or male you are watching?


 I firmly believe that a home should be a last resort kind of thing. Kudos to you!"
Caregivers anyone?,"I am new to this board, but not a new member. I am a live in caregiver to a patient that has dementia and alzheimer's. I work 24/7 6 days a week. And I can use some support to keep sane. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to talk with me. Thanks.","i completely agree with Red on this its a great thing you are doing you do need some support we are definitely here hugs lyn


 You are more then welcome to come on here and talk with us anytime :) Many of us are or were caregivers also so I am pretty sure we all know where you are coming from. Taking care of someone with dementia or AZ is hard and it takes patience, love and understanding. What you are doing is comendable. Not that many people would be willing to do what you do."
father in law just diagnosed!!,"hey guys, not been around for a while, but just found out my Father in law has been diagnosed with dementia! though we have suspected for a while that something wasn't right? can any one tell me what the best meds are in the uk for treating him. been out the loop in this forum for a while, so not sure what's available!!! cheers ps, how you doing Lynn (howlyncat)??? sandra xxx Post Edited (mrs mac) : 6/16/2009 7:54:21 AM (GMT-6)","Ebixa is ok I think. Keeping his mind busy does work if you can do it.I'm on my pc alot every day I also bowl online & win tounaments........


 I think a lot of the medications that are available in the US are also available in the UK. Like Aricept, Namenda, Exelon, Rasidyne. Their Market names might be different. I think the Alzheimer's Society in the UK would be a great place to get more answers.

 I'm sorry to hear of your FIL's diagnosis. I am not familiar with the meds they have in the UK but they have my grandmother on Namenda and it's seems to work OK but not the best. It seems her bad days are outnumbering her good lately so I may have to talk to her doctor about this. Lyn hasn't been around lately. I'm not quite sure why, health reasons, family, etc maybe...

She Wont Listen To ME..Bellas Story PART 2,Yes I do have a liner pad under her sheets and it's catching the urine so her mattress is dry. The problem is the sheets are still wet so I have to clean that whenever it happens along with the liner. Last night I had the liner on top of her sheets but they don't stay in place because when she gets into bed she slides in instead of getting on top of the liner which then shifts it all over the place. I slept with her last night and told my sister to sleep in my room instead. I got up twice with her and she peed both times in the toilet only. Praise the lord! My sister suggested I get a part-time job during the graveyard shift since I don't sleep anyways. I said this is my part-time job and she said I could get one more in addition. She's been exhausted from the many interruptions in the night from hearing us get up even though she hasn't done a thing to help out. I'm used to the pressure while the lady of leisure is ready to go back to her tranquil life.,"Good idea, thanks very much.


 oops I accidentally unsubscribed to this for future replies to this. How do I subscribe again? I clicked on the wrong link when I got the email notification. Sorry.


 Nope. I made it worse. It has x on all the topics I've contributed and when i click on it thinking it would take the x away, it took the topic away instead. Meanwhile. My mother has ear wax the size of a rock in her ear so her doctor cannot drain it for now. We got ear drops to loosen them up first. I knew she seemed off recently from not responding to questions and generally not here. She's also probably diabetic now. The list of ailments just keep growing.


 I did get notice about this posting so I think I'm fine now. My sister has diabetes and used that thing that pricks your finger. She did it on me and I was under 100 but my mom came up with 122 so she took her to the doctor to get a real blood test. When she had a blood test done back in Jan she was already close to that so he said she was pre diabetic. I was always concerned that my mom would have it because my grandfather had it. Her doctor told me last year that at her age if she hasn't had it by now then she should be safe. yeah right! Here we go again. This morning she kept a pill in her mouth. I brushed her teeth right after wards and orange water came out of her mouth. Good grief!


 Last night was a setback. She peed at 3:30 in the toilet and then when we got up at 6:30 she had already peed in her diaper which leaked into the bed sheet yet again. This time it was a lot more than the last. Her Pj's were soaked too. I feel like all I do is the laundry. Yesterday morning she kept her pill in her mouth for at least 3 hours. She spit it out when I fed her first bite of lunch. I'm really surprised it didn't melt by then. My sister left 2 days ago. She told me she was going to Morocco for a week with her husband. I asked her what for and she said ""what do people go there for? Vacation of course"" I didn't say anything after that. What I was thinking was ""WHAT THE HELL DO YOU NEED A VACATION FROM?"" Life never is fair. Usually the younger sibling is off the hook of parental duties but not in my case. I'm the youngest and I'm stuck with all the crap work. Mostly because I'm willing to do it rather than send my mom to a home which is what my other siblings want to do. Everyone wants the easy way out. No one is willing to sacrifice their freedom to take care of mom. So here I am... over 40 and living in a fishbowl while everyone else in my family has traveled the world.


 Last night she was dry. She got up on her own at 1 and then I got her up at 3. By the time we really got up for good at 6 her diaper was dry. When I was getting ready to leave for work and take her to the senior center I took her to the bathroom and this time she refused to sit down on the toilet much less let me take her pants down. We fought for 10 minutes over this. I spanked her bottom and she hit my arm. Finally she got tired of holding on to her pants and standing above the toilet that she finally let go and peed. Xanax is my savior. Without taking this I would really jump off a building. Every day is drama in my life. I sometimes take out old video tapes taken with my mom from 15 years ago to show her. She has a good time watching herself and doesn't see that she's any different now. All her friends have stopped calling. I don't blame them really. What's there to say to someone who doesn't recognize you and only talks gibberish. My uncle's wife used to be really close to my mom and I haven't heard from them in 2 years and they only live 13 miles away. I used to get really angry and hurt but I have to be in other people's shoes. If this happened to them I don't think I would be visiting either. Their son is getting married in August and I'm sure they will understand that we won't be attending or sending any gifts. I understand but doesn't mean I won't hold a grudge. haha My friends have been constantly telling me to put my mom in a home for my sanity. I then remembered an article I read about a woman who wrote about taking care of parents. After all do parents drop their kids off in an orphanage when they have behavioral problems or is autistic or is sick? Why is it ok to do that to the elderly and not to the young?


 Unfortunately spanking her is the only way I can a reaction from her. She's barely talking anymore and does not do anything I ask her to. Changing her is back breaking and getting her in and out of bed and the toilet is no walk in the park either. My mom is not lightweight so spanking her rear end is hardly punishment. She knows she's done something wrong but at the same time she's in no pain. In a way it actually wakes her up and pays attention more. It's not as bad as it sounds. Yesterday when I got home from work, the caretaker was trying to play ball with her. Usually my mom would catch the ball when it's thrown at her but just as I walked in the door I saw the ball in midair and my mom didn't attempt to catch it so it just hit her in the face and she didn't even flinch. The woman kept trying to show her how to bounce the ball but my mom acted like she was invisible. I look at pictures taken of her from 3 years ago and she was so alive and actually would pose for the pictures but now she never smiles and is not aware of the camera at all. :(


 HOW are you doing today BELLA n how was yr moms night huggs lyn


 I took my mom to her doctor's office yesterday to get her ear wax drained. She jumped each time the poor nurse pressed the pump to extract the wax through the tube. It got all over the woman. At least my mom can hear much better now and guess what? She's actually following directions from me which gives me hope. All these months that she's been deviant was because she couldn't hear what I was saying to her and she felt threatened with my actions because she didn't know what I was up to. She even peed when I take her to the bathroom and has not resisted so far. Her doctor gave a prescript ion so she can start getting diapers/bed liners/chair in the bathtub/toilet handlebar for free because my mom is on govt. assistance. I am so relieved. I hope she will sit in the chair when I bathe her once I get the stuff. One more bit of good news is that she's not diabetic. I still don't understand how her glucose level is lower now then when she was tested in Jan when she considered borderline diabetic. The test showed her at 29 for glucose and Glycohemoglobin (HB A1C) at 5.6 and he said that's the most accurate indication of all and she's fine. I asked if this was a mistake because she even had some cookies with her breakfast that morning before she had the test done. He said I have to believe that this is a miracle and leave it at that. While I was waiting for a copy of the blood test a couple of nurse looked at me and my mom and said we look exactly alike. I smiled and said ""ain't that the truth"" I took her for a joyride in my car after leaving the doctors office and she was actually enjoying the ride instead of trying to remove the seat belt or unlock the door to escape. I pointed to all the flowers on the side of the road and she actually looked and smiled and acknowledged that they were there. After 30 minutes I asked her if she wanted to keep going or go home and she answered no let's keep moving. I know this kind of interaction won't last but I was really absorbing this in like you won't believe. I told her doctor about her unwillingness to swallow her pills and he said it's useless to fight it. Eventually she will be fed through a tube because she can't swallow a thing due to her PD. I didn't want to hear that. 2 nights ago she kept her big pill in her mouth when she went to bed. I'm sure it dissolved slowly in her mouth. 2 hours later she woke up choking in thick phlegm and didn't want to open her eyes or get up. I eventually got her to go to the bathroom and made her spit it out. I then had her rinse her mouth and she went back to bed breathing with a clear sounding passage way. That was really frightening.


 Thanks. I took my mom to her regular Neurologist appointment. I told her about the hearing problem and the lack of cooperation in taking her meds. Her doctor at first thought of substituting Stalevo with Sinemet and Comtan but they would have to be generics and she is not a fan of them because they are not the real deal in her books. In the end I told her we will stick with Stavelo and I'll just have her take it by itself before her other pills and hope for the best. You'll never believe this. As we were about to leave the doctor's office I opened the door that leads into the waiting area so we could go and there was one man sitting there waiting for his turn. My mom started to take off her pants with her back side facing the man. I was mortified. I don't have a clue as to why she did that. Of all things she never allows anyone to remove her clothing so to have her strip like that today was very disturbing. I dropped her off at the daycare center and I ran errands. I had the day off from work but I couldn't leave her alone at home for the amount of time I would need so I took her to the center. As usual when I went to pick her up she was very disoriented and in la la land. I just don't get it. The nurse that escorted her out with me said my mom is very good client and listens to all of them and really enjoys being there. Well she could have fooled me!


 My mom's been going to that center for over 2 years now. At the beginning she would never do what they asked and they got really frustrated and asked me to take her out and put her in a Alzheimer related center far away from where we live. I was really angry because they have other people that go there that requires special attention too. There was even a mentally retarded woman who was there but they said at least she would listen to them. I was very close to writing a nasty letter to the state and hope to close them down. My sister went and talked with the Manager and in the end they let my mom stay. I guess my mom grew on them. I got into a heated argument with my sister over this because she acted like she was on their side and she suggested that it was time we put mom in a home for good. I won in the end and told her no state run facilities would take her if I said I was watching her and does not want their services. So there! There are a few workers there that I wish would be removed. One time I saw one of the nurses that feed my mom being rough with her by yelling at her to swallow her food. My poor mom's leg was shaking non-stop from being so scared. I happened to be there to take a jacket for her and witnessed it. When that nurse saw me she then softened her voice and I then said my mom was not hungry because I feed her breakfast every morning before she goes in. I cried on my way to work after seeing that. I wished I could win the lottery and not have to work so I could stay at home with her always. Now my mom is used to the place and they are all pretty attentive to her. In a place with over a hundred attendees the workers all know her name so that's saying something. At the beginning their drivers would take her home with others via van transportation but with my mom in her state of mind or lack of I got paranoid that the male drivers would do harm to her and think that they wouldn't have to answer to anyone because she wouldn't tell. So I hired someone to bring her home and stay with her until I got back from work. You just never know these days.... Still I prefer to be home with her when I have days off. People suggested that I still take her so I can get the break. I don't see it that way. One day I spend with her is one day I get to see her more.


 As i posted in last thread i hv started another one for you n the support you need please know you are being heard n i do understand i truly do i went thru it with both parents mom passed n dad was fine til she passed he went downhill very quickly his soul mate in life was gone he did almost all for her with exception to bathing changing ect n i was there daily As mentioned try checking into Soaker pads for her The Alzheimer Society should be able to direct you or a good pharmacy i do hope you find a couple of these as they are so good for saving changing sheets keep looking after you as well the caregiver can easily get sick imho huggs lyn


 Bella, a little hint from a retired nurse. Put the sheet on the bed. Put the liner pad on top. Take a second sheet, fold it in half, put it over the liner and tuck tightly on both sides. When wetness happens, you can change just this ""draw"" sheet and liner, and the sheet will hold it in place. Blessings on you for the care you are giving her.


 Yes that works well too huggs lyn


 GO to control panel n i believe you can fix it there if not let me know n i will check in am huuggs lyn


 OMgoodness more issues to deal with the wax should loosen up with drops did doc check her BSL when she saw him i am eally not 100 percent sure how to fix this i will ask other mods n get back to you asap huggs lyn


 It never seems to end i know im so happy she did get up n piddle in toilet during the night thats great ya i hv a younger sister i call..maiden of the manor..she was the spoiled one for sure but she never did a dang thing for mom nor dad n that ticks me off to this day when the house was sold i had to get4 of us together to gv checks her n 2 brothers the 2 brothers took dad out n stuff n visited alot with mom n dad but 98 percent was on me i handed her her check for quarter of the house money n said here i think this is plenty for what you didnt do.. lol we dont talk at all i so despise what this DD does to our loved ones hang in there n keep posting huggs lyn


 Bella as lonely n hard as this gets i honestly would not trade the last while with mom n dad it still very hard on me that they are gone sandi the youngest had everything handed to her i worked my bottom off in nursing and looking after them you will have the real satisfaction of knowing you did all you could n more for her i know this personally i fought tooth n nail with all 3 siblings all they wanted to do was stick parents in a home mom had worked all her life in geriatrics n this would hv really not been something she would have wanted mom did so much for ALL us kids even during her good final yrs babysitting n basically bringing up my lil sisters son who would hv rather drink then do any real parenting your comment about living in a fishbowl kinda hit me square in the head as this is what i am doing to self now too i think that is why cait may be acting out with me she is used to the up early gone n always on the go mom i did everything for her and loved it and yes she is youngest too hmmmm you have certainly given me some food for thought too i sure hope you had better night with mom n i will keep you in my thoughts n prayers hugs lyn


 i personally thinks its because our Elders are the backbone of the family i believe in all my time nursing geriatrics we might hv had 2 natives in there and that was because they had no family out here Elders were revered very very much in some. most Native tribes and looked to for guidancs knowledg n wisdom their basis is still around christianity and for the most part it works for then bella i must caution you about spanking her i know you are doing this alone n youve done proud but corporal punishiment is not allowed at least not here n you must hv grest doctor that is up with her care n tx regine way plz do keep positng


 Yes it is very dang sad i know i saw both parents go thru this but dad could still do his gardens n such when mom passed he was gone in no time at all they did share a beautiful life n love together for over 50 yrs i still miss them both so much its heartbreaker this is a really sad n horrible disease takr care lyn


 Bella thinking of you n your momma huggs lyn

 MORNING BELLA sorry i have been out n down with flu from hades i dont think a flu has hit me that hard in yrs the generic meds hv cheaper fillers n stuff in them but my mom was the same had to be name brand meds or nothing i think sticking to the med is a good idea for now my heavens ..what was she thinking sorry im not laughing but they do DO SOME wild n silly things dont they we had so many that were timid as could be held onto their clothes for dear life while others ran around in bd suits or we had to fight to keep dressed its all part of the progression i think im not 100 percent sure but your momma sounds like a kicker like mine was have you ever been or had the chance to sit back somehow out of her sight n knowledge n evaluate the situation at daycare just for even half hour..or hour w/o her knowing you r there it is your right n im wondering it seems she does have some issues with this place many are great dont get me wrong but you yourself n i know how frustrating n hard it is to look after one person with this dd not saying there is abuse by staff but there could be another member of that day care that sets her off for whatever reason reminds her of something sets of a warning bell anything out of sorts in her ..world ..ya know this isnt the first time right so i would check we had one of people from our RH always come in upset after her day at co op n thru investigating n watching we found that one of the others was constantly bothering her n slapping her lightly on hands for reasons we never could find out but we changed the ppl she was in room with n she became more passive n less aggitated just a thought idk whats going on there keeping you in thoughts blessings lyn


 oh sorry, I hope you are recovering from the flu. It sounds horrible! One more thing. 2 nights ago my mom peed in the toilet at 2:30 by 4:00 she peed in her diaper yet again. This morning she snored all the way from 8:30 to 4:30 where I then took her to pee. Her diaper was dry. I just don't get it. I was already up at 2 but she never woke up so I just waited and waited and thinking she probably already peed in her diaper but it didn't happen."
A great Online Resource for Alzheimer's,"hey everyone! I just joined here, but I have been a member of the Alzheimer's Association Message boards for a while now. There are so many great people on those boards (as i am sure there are here too) who have been so supportive and answered a lot of my very big questions. I am trying to find all the support I can get, and if you are like me you have to check this out. I know it may be wierd that my first post is like a banner ad for another message board, but I just want you all to know there is help out there. So if you go to http://alzheimers.infopop.cc/eve you will reach that message board. I go to the Caregivers Forum, but there are other sections that many other members tend to hang out in.

fahter passed,"I have been on the forum a few times looking for information about alzheimers. Just wanted to let everyone know that has helped me, that my father passed away. He suffered for over 8 years with alzheimers. He was only 75 years old when he passed on. He was a wonderful man and I will miss him more than words can say. My mother was his caregiver and is an exceptional woman. She truly loved him and never left his side. I know how difficult it was for her but she made a choice to never leave him. She took him and my children on a trip this summer, a vacation my children will never forget. He was in a hospital bed for the past several months when they came home and declined very quickley. He had is entire family with him when he passed. I know that he is happy and can see us all very cleary now. It truly is the disease with a very long goodbye. I know that everyone situation is different than the next. But please make sure that you tell you loved one how much you love them while they are still here. Hold them, touch, them, sing to them..... do everything you can to tell them know how much they are loved. I know my dad passed on knowing that we all loved him. I wich everyone well in the long journey they will be taking with their loved one.","I am also sorry that you have lost your dad i have gone thru it and i feel the pain...you do say some very poignant and true things in your post thanks for that..keep us posted on you okay..take care gentle huggs...lym

Aricept,"Hello everyone. This is my first post on the Alzheimer's forum. My mother has been diagnosed with dementia. Her neurologist tried her on Namenda, but her prescript ion plan only approves it for those in the moderate to severe stages. They said there was not evidence to support her being at that level yet, so coverage was denied. She was switched to Aricept. At first, she occasionally remarked about an upset tummy, but it did not seem to be too much of a problem for her and we thought the Aricept was helping hold her where she was for a while. She has been on the Aricept for about five months. Lately, she complains of stomach problems qute a bit, often refusing to go out to eat with relatives and friends. This was something she used to enjoy and do frequently. She also seems depressed a good deal of the time. Does anyone have a similar experience with Aricept? I would have expected the stomach upsets to be getting milder, not worse for the amount of time she has been on the medication. The neurologist suggested switching her dose until bedtime instead of in the morning. As a side note, it does not seem to have helped her as much over the last six weeks, either. Her doctor thinks she will be needing assisted living before fall. Thankfully, there is a lovely facility here in town, and a group of her friends are currently living there. I dread the change, and my sister and I feel it will be a major challenge getting her to agree. We are trying to keep her in her home as long as possible. My sister is there with her when she herself is not at work, and relatives and friends frequently check on Mother during the day. Thanks for any input or advice you can offer.","Thank you, Lyn. My sympathy on the loss of your mother.

 Welcome to our lil HW family........My mom was on this med and for her it worked ,sadly I lost her on March 20th of this yr........My Dad is not taking this med now herefuses to ,but the doc will be seeing him on Tuesday and hopefully he will decide to listen to the doc.......I am so sorry about your Mom ,this is hard to deal with I sure know that as well as do the other members on this site......On the Yellow sidebar go to thre resources and check out Aricept.....it will give you all the info you need the resources of HW are fantastic as are the people .......I am going to bump some threads up for you to have a look at .....Please post often adn I am sure others will be along (wknds tend to be slower) but we have a member Snowy that I know will give you her great input and advice....She has AD and is a very caring and giving woman.............Rosie will also no doubt pop on if she is around ......I am glad you found us and that you now know you are not alone in this anymore.......Take care and God Bless......Lyn


 If the Aricept is too much for her ask about Razadyne.I took Aricept for 4 yrs 'til it stopped working then went to Razadyne,that was 4 yrs ago.With Aricept I bought depends & hung on as the medication does work.The side effects do away after awhile............IT TAKES TIME!


 Aricept appears to be giving my mother-in-law diareah. ( I don't think she realizes the connection between the two.) Side effects are supposed to get better over time, but I don't think that is always the case. For depression, ask her doctor for an antidepressant, my mother-in-law takes one together with the Aricept. No sense letting her suffer with it, when a pill might help...................Inert Post Edited (inert) : 10/10/2006 10:22:07 PM (GMT-6)

 Mighty, I am not the regular moderator here on the Alzheimers forum and I am not sure when our AZ mod will be on. But, you need to change your user name. This is against forum rules. If it is not changed, it may be viewed that you are a spammer and you may end up getting banned from HW. Regarding your mother, I can't comment about the Rasadyne. My Gma is on Namenda and it seems to work for her, though personally I think she needs an additional med to help. Namenda has not bothered my Gma's stomach or anything else. This is another med that is used to treat AZ."
The Holidays,"In the past, for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas, my Gma has always went with us to various relative's houses. This year I am afraid that we won't be able to take her. She is having trouble walking still since she broke her hip and she doesn't even try to do the physical therapy - she has given up. So that would leave us to transport her wheelchair and some of these relative's houses are not very wheelchair friendly. Also, she has very little control of her bowels so I keep picturing the scenario of what if she has an accident while at the relatives??? I know it would be up to me to help her get cleaned up and changed but that may be physically impossible for me due to arthritis and neck issues. Her mental status has also declined so rapidly that she is losing the memory of some people and she gets lost in time and place. I hate leaving her there at the assisted living center for the holidays but I don't see any way around it. I dunno what this post is about really but I am just getting a little down about the holidays coming and the possibility of not being able to take my Gma with us. I was discussing this with my husband and he agreed that it may not be a wise course of action to take her out and about for the holidays. So we are going to go see her on the holidays and stay with her for a while. I think that is a fair compromise for both her and us?","Yes it is a very hard thing to accept. As I was growing up, my Gma lived 800 miles away from me but she always was just a phone call away and we wrote all the time. Then when my Gpa passed away and she moved in with us, I was happy to have my Gma back physically in my life. Now it seems like I lost her again. Granted she is only 15 minutes away now but still it's hard to not have her with me during the holidays.


 Sherry, my heart goes out to you. Gma has fought the good fight with your help, and it's hard for both of you to face this first holiday season with the changes that have happened. I think you've made the very best decision. We used to always visit my gma late morning on Thanksgiving and late afternoon on Christmas eve, then sometime during Christmas day. We would take her little gifts and sometimes some of her favorite holiday foods, sit and visit, then go on to our festivities with the rest of the family. I think by the time we finished our visit, she was tired, ready for a nap and ready for us to leave. It worked out well for everyone, and then she was able to participate in the facility's celebrations also. ((((Sherry))))

Is Klonipin Bad for someone with Alzheimers,Does anyone know if Klonipin is bad for someone who has AD If so what would be a good anti anxiety/panic attack medication. Thanks for any input -,"imho ativan would be a better choice but you have to remember it also can be addictive..i take it only when panic is bad......is this for you Hope....lyn


 i am doing much better thanks hun...i have neuropathy and use lyrica as well as ativan it does help me / lyrica helps with fibro....my very best to you and hubby...happy holidays sweetie...luvs lyn


 Klonopin is good short term, but you build up a tolerance to it fast. And then even if you stay at the same doseage, it will stop working and you can actually withdraw on a stable doseage even if you keep taking it. similar to opiates in tolerance issues. ultimately klonopin made my anxiety worse because i could never use enough of it, and the withdrawal is worse anxiety, panic, and flu/nervous system symptoms. Use with caution but do use it if its absolutely necessary.


 Hi Lyn - No - It is for my husband who also suffers from Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease How are you doing by the way Happy Holidays to you and yours !!


 Lyn - Same to you. Take care. Type to you soon. Hope"
vancomyacin and merrem and alzheimers,Has anyone had any experiences with intravenous vancomyacin and merrem and alzheimers? My father was treated for pneumonia with vancomyacin and merrem in the hospital and had a dramatic improvement in his ability to verbally communicate. He was treated with it one day and the next day he started talking again. He spoke in a normal manner for several days after. The doctors were treating the pneumonia not the alzheimers. His communication abilities declined gradually there after. The doctors felt the increased talking ability was the result of treating the infection of pneumonia but was not a treatment for the alzheimers. By chance has anyone observed the coincidence of this effect with these meds and alzheimers?,Hi i have not heard of this before but i am glad your dad had good response to it...i would have to say that vanco on a long time iv can cause some problems from my own experiences and documented ones...i have lost hearing totally it is being blamed partially on the long term iv vanco use but thats me n how i reacted.......how is your dad now...glad you found us here...keep posting great family support here...lyn
I am a newby to this sight,"Hi my name is Gerry, 15 years ago at age 57 my husband managed a chemical plant and was injured on the job.

caring - over empathically,"Something that rarely gets mentioned in personal accounts of caring for a parent or other close family member is the fear that some of their early signs, ie: short term memory loss, can inspire in oneself. That and a fear of genetic inheritance. I am far more aware now of suddenly losing a word that was perfect for what I was about to say or write and, although everyone I know suffers similar lapses, they become more troubling when you have had one parent end their days in 'a state of unknowing'. In a sense, I've found that spending too much time, beyond my capacities, can have this effect . It's as though one almost catches the suffering endured by the sufferer. Has anybody else experienced this?","MY sweet friend it has been so long i was away was in hospital myself on life support rough go but i am here i can really empathise now with ad peeps in the same situation to an extent i have real bad memory gaps memories are gone ..when i came out of seizure i did not remember caitlyn my daughter i am still battling these demons i have with trying to remember so many things i have forgot it is very hard to see the look of puzzement on caits face when i cannot remember someone something..twist of fate my friend i wonder all those yrs i looked after ad peeps ..hmmm...i can honestly say it is very scary for me so i am a lot more in tune with others in same simuliar circumstances......cant wait to read your book i was on the journey with you for so long my friend....love n blessings...lyn

 Hello Lyn, It's so sad to find that you are unwell. You have given so very much and you now deserve the best of care there is in return. With reference to the book. I finished it some time ago and there is just one small outstanding item; the pen name on the cover requires amending. It should be available by the end of the month. As for me? There are periods I find myself lost and try to get back into the mindset I developed as a child of shutting out the world. There's the constant fear that many AD sufferers find ever present; of being 'put away' when one can no longer cope on one's own. I'm still fighting those fears with the morning run. At 78, I must be at least one card short of a full deck. As view stories on different Alzheimer's sites it's noticeable that care givers still encounter the same problems I experienced with Jean, and the advice rarely changes. In choosing to do my own thing by ignoring set boundaries, I found some success and discovered the gift of caring for her to be a many splendid experience. Some of the interaction between doctors and care givers brings to mind a story. A fellow visited a doctor with a sore eye. He explained: ""That every time I drink a cup of tea I get this sharp pain in my right eye"". The doctor: ""Do you take sugar?"" Patient: ""Yes, why do you ask?"" Answer : ""I suggest you remove the spoon from the cup!"" It's good to see the funny side of life. Take care, and may your God go with you. Padraig


 Myrio, I too had a parent pass away from alzheimers. You didn't state how old you are, not that it matters much because many people develop symtoms at an early age, I was just wondering. Another question, are you on any meds that could be causing you issues with memory lose. I take Neurontin (gabapentin generic) and it does cause me problems with remembering words or people. When my mother started showing symptoms her doctor ordered a ct scan of her brain and it showed she was having mini-strokes. We had no idea. What I am saying is there could be something else that may be causing your problems. This sounds like something you need to discuss with your doctor. It may be an easy fix. Good Luck!!!!


 Hello Everyone, It's coming up to two years since the love of my life passed away. 52 years of marriage passed so quickly and now I'm left to reflect on my life, and what a life it's been! Myrio, I understand only too well your fear of ever suffering with Alzheimer's. Almost daily I find myself checking for signs of failing short term memories. Fear, was about the first thing I learned in life, but I also learned to deal with it. There are advantages and disadvantages in life and every aspects of life and when you see the disadvantages as challenges to overcome, you become stronger and reap the rewards. I owe a big thank you to Healing Well for the support I received during my care giving years. Some of you may remember my story of caring alone for my wife 24/7 365 days for four years and eight months. I had removed her from a Nursing Home when she could no longer speak, move and rigidity had set in. She was skin and bone suffered with bad pressure sores. I chose to stop all medication except for liquid pain killer. Two months after arriving home one evening, I summoned a doctor for advice. He advised that I not sit holding her hand over night, as she was likely to pass away when I went to the bathroom or to make a drink. Somehow I managed to bring her back to physical health and we enjoyed an extra four and a half years together! Strange as it may seem I now find life much harder without my soul mate. I would happily swap places to be caring for her in the blink of an eye. She was my salvation, my purpose for living. She left me with the strength to carry on because she made me whole. Had I not suffered the whole of my childhood by being locked away from the outside world and deemed a criminal at age two by the courts in Ireland and sentenced to 14 years detention, I could never been capable of caring as I did. For a child to grow up never to experience love, never mind nurture, when love walks into such a person's life they don't let it go. Without a formal education, I managed to learn so very much about the strange new world I was released into as a 16year old. For the first time the hidden story of every kind of abuse inflicted on children in the Industrial Schools system in Ireland, was released to a shocked world in May of this year. So long my secret shame is no more but theirs to live with. I'm hoping that by writing about my experiences of how I viewed caring for my wife, will help in some small way those caring for loved ones. Had I just written of my getting up each morning at 04.40AM and going for a run, then to do the caring, washing, cleaning, cooking, shopping, etc every single day for years on end, it would be hard to believe. With that in mind I have written about my background and life after I found love. My book is going into production on Thursday and it's titled; 'Dare to Dream'. about fear; to me it means that someone, or some thing has control over you. Once I took control of our lives my fear vanished, I became a winner. Hope this post is not too long. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Lyn I'm glad you are back & doing better.Still on 02 24/7.Last week Larry had me to the clinic,Dr said the next time we may not be able to bring you back. They thought I had the flu but I didn't,just a small infection in the lungs.They were ready to send me to the hosp.when I say NO!!!! I got a shot in de butt,extra inhale meds for my nebulizer & I came home.I'm doing ever so much better. I am going to get a finger Oximiter soon to keep check on my 02..........When I went in Fri.it was 73,not good at all............is 96 now.......


 Lyn, I feel so sad to learn of your condition. After all the years you gave to others, I sincerely hope that you receive the very best support you so richly deserve. After my experiences with caring for my wife, I find it very upsetting to keep reading and seeing the frustration that both loved ones and care givers are repeatedly put through. I'm only too aware that everyone is different: care givers and their loved ones, but there are so many common factors that come with this illness. By writing my story I'm hoping that many of the ways I managed to cope with looking after my wife on my own for so many years will prove useful to others. Circumstances differ for each person that make it impossible for almost anyone to go it alone. It was my good fortunate to have been capable of managing alone. We were a couple; she 73 and I, 76; married 52 years, by the time she passed. It'll be reward enough to know that by reading our story, it will help and encourage other caregivers through the challenges of providing loving care for their loved ones. At a cost of $3,800 to publish, I expect little or no return for our story, it's just something I felt compelled to do. There have been times I've felt down since Jean's passing. Some might call it depression, but like a March hare I fight it by running 7 miles each morning at 05.30AM! Hang in there Lyn and keep fighting. May your God go with you. Padraig

 Put youself in the repeaters shoes. I have short term memmory loss. My husband gets so frustrated when I ask him something he has just told me. Or repeat the same thing over and over and over. Sorry I can't help it. I just say I may have asked before but please tell me again I will try to focus this time. I'm not sure how alshimers works. I can still remember when I was three, My wedding, my first communion , when my grandfather died, my mom, my dad. But if you ask me about what I did yesterday ??????? Two months ago my brother passed away I don't know what I wore or how I got there. Ayway I went to visit one of my older sisters who is home bound a few weeks later and she asked me if I had seen my oldest brother at the funeral. I responded what funeral??? She said our brothers. I said which one . She said you kidding my kids saw you there with your grand kids. Maybe I just wanted to forget that one. He was the only one I could really relate to because of our similar iliness. Have to stop and think a long time. My problem is the only person close enough to talk to is my husband so I just try not to say much to him any more . I have no one to talk to and I am so frustrated and so alone, I could't began to tell you how many times I just break down and cry . Something as simple as"" did I already add salt"". Or just spilling a glass of water..Just make me crying for an hour. my memmory may improve with time. but I don't some one with alhimers has that possibly. I really miss my brother. about two weeks before he passed on , I went to visit him as usual and he knew he wasen't going to live much longer so he gave me some of his valued sentimentals. He said because you appreciate thing that others don't I said wait a minute what happens if I go first . Am I supposed to send back to you. Then we just joked around and laughed. Memmories wether New Or Old ''Good or Bad Are A Great Loss For All Involved I'm Sure it is Very Difficult Just remember ""The Greatest Is Love june


 AMEN.......Snowy.......luvs lyn


 Alazheimer's does that to a person,nothing you can do about it........


 Thank you both for clarifying that.....luvs lyn miss you my friend ....God bless


 It is a cruel dd and i despise it as well......we are here for support...just keep loving her w/o condition...lyn


 Even if you told her to stop repeating herself, she will forget that you told her to. It's the nature of the beast unfortunately. I relate it to talking to a child in a grown up voice. You treat them like you would an inquisitive child, answer the same questions over and over again. Would you lose patience with a 3 year old that kept asking the same question? Most would not. But sometimes if you redirect her thought processes by showing her something or have her do something else, it can stop the repetitive questioning much like the proverbial child.


 If your loved one repeat the same question multiple times she is not trying to annoy you, she truly believes it is the first time she is asking you the question, and your job is to reply as if it's the first time she is asking the question. This isn't easy and it takes a load of patience to accomplish, but try your best, and remember, her reality is now different than yours. Reminding her she forgot won't change this fact, and will only make her worse. so hang in there and keep practicing in everyday interactions with her... ........................................Deleted other post as it only had one word in it .......thanks....Lyn Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 10/7/2009 11:25:13 PM (GMT-6)


 This must be so frustrating to have the same thing said over and over again. I know, I have been there. In many cases I would just smile at my dad, or let him know I understand. For example, he may tell me that the game is on tonight and he needs to watch it like 50 times. I would respond as calm as possible ""Ok dad I'll make sure the TV is ready for you"" Then I try to change to subject to get his mind off the game, otherwise he may just repeat it again and again. So maybe try to get to distract your mom and bring up another subject for her to focus on. My dad likes to talk about his grandkids so I always bring them up when I need to distract him.


 I have Vascular Dementia & also at times ask questions over & over.That's the way it is,like it or not.........


 Have you experienced taking your child on a trip? Many will recall: ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" Many parents become upset, others just smile and try to distract them. Our daughter use to turn the question around to her children, asking them if we were there yet. Think about it; child and parent, you may well haven driven your Mom nuts, like all children do at times. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Like Snowy says, nothing you can do about it, except to love them all the more as you would do a disabled child. Alzheimer's disables the person. Padraig


 Yes. I am hating life right about now. What a cruel disease this is! I am angry, upset and mad as hell! My mother sounds so good to me on the phone and yet, my cousin says that she is fading fast. My mother told her a couple of weeks ago that she can't believe that she worked all her life for ""this"".....She wished she would die. Ugggg. I hate it!"
Razadyne,"Hello everyone, My mom's neurologist said my mom's brain functions are declining very rapidly from the EEG test result. She suggested my mom must take another med in addition to Namenda which she's been taking for the past 2 years. Aricept gave her nightmares and Exelon raised her blood pressure. This leaves with Razadyne which is the only one left of the cholinesterase inhibitors that she hasn't taken yet. Does anyone have an opinion on this older medication? Is it worth my mom to give it a try. Will it cause her more harm then good? Thanks!","Just the fact that you've been taking it for 8 years now and can post on this forum shows me that it's working wonders for you. My mom's only had the disease for 5 years and has stopped reading and writing for 2 already. Namenda is for the really advanced people I assume and being that she was only on that alone is not helping but... like you said not everyone can take a combo drug. Hopefully it will help her and not give her side effects. She's starting it tonight.


 After being on the Namenda for 2 months,I didn't know what i was doing,& was droolong.I still knew what was going on & I didn't like it.We didn't know If I would come back to where I was before starting the Namenda or no,but I did...........Not doing that again.........

 Bella, The Irish have a saying: ""May I be in haven half an hour before the devil knows I'm dead."" I think it's wonderful the way you car for your Mom. Never having had parents or family, I came to understand the meaning of love from my wife and the strength it fuels to return that love in their special time of need. May your God go with you. Padraig


 I take Galenyimine ( generic Razadyne) I have had no problems with it.Been on it 8 yrs.Nameneda is supposed to be taken with another AD medication,not alone.......I tried Namenda & it was a disaster so I threw it away.........It's NOT for everyone.......


 Hi SnowyLynne, What happened to you when you combined Namenda with Galenyimine? My mom has been taking 8mg just once a day at dinner time. She's been on it for about a week now and yesterday she had an episode while we ate lunch at a restaurant. She played with the zipper of her jacket non stop and I ended up feeding her in order for her to want to eat. When we were leaving the place she held the front door open and wouldn't let go. This concerned the waitress who watched this behavior. I gave my mom my car keys so she got distracted and finally let go. This was a big mistake because when we got to my car in the parking lot she wouldn't give the keys back to me. We then stayed there for 15 minutes while I tried to persuade her to hand them back to me. The manager of the restaurant then came out and asked if there was a problem. During this ordeal my mom was also flagging down people who drove by us. She seemed to be paranoid and very nervous and was babbling the whole time. Each time I said please give me the keys so I can drive us home she would say ""yes I know you need the keys"" It's like she says one thing but does the exact opposite. I think she got tired at the end and gave them back to me. When we got home she was back to her old self again. It was very strange. I don't know if it was Galenyimine that did this or something she would do anyways. Last week my sister experienced a somewhat similar experience at the hair salon with my mom. When she was done she refused to get out of her seat to leave the place. This happened before she started on the new med. It's getting so that I don't want to take her anyplace public anymore. I feel so self conscious and pathetic as to how people see us. We were quite a spectacle at the restaurant.


 Hi Bella, I think it's a sad reflection on society that anyone should stare at people with a disability like Alzheimer's. Can't say I know anything about the drugs you mention, but what I do know from my experience was that I stopped all medication, with the exception of liquid pain killer my wife after I took her home. It's just my view, that a lot of medication is prescribed for aspects of the illness, rather than treating the underlying causes the victims experience. I do know that, had I been treated as many patients were, I would in turn be frustrated, angry and depressed. Imagine what it must be like to be so confused and unable to express yourself? Holding on to the door may indicate the early signs that your Mom is beginning to lose her sense of spacial awareness. This I learned through bitter experience was a time my wife started to have falls. Her final fall resulted in her breaking her arm and ending up in hospital. That was the beginning of the end. It's a sad fact, that each function she lost I failed to spot the early signs. Suddenly she was unable to walk down stairs, moments later she walked down without effort. Her loss of speech was the same. Right up to weeks before she died I took her out shopping and I had these trips recorded. There was no way that I was about to hide her away from the outside world. Too bad if people didn't like me taking her to the bank, shops and any place we wanted. As far as I'm concerned disabled means; being unable to cope in one way or another. That means we are all disabled in some way, only in most cases the disability is not visible. Many loved ones fail to complete the journey to a final stage my wife did, where they become exactly like an adorable baby, in a loving environment. Lyn, I was sorry to learn you have been so very ill. I'll always remember you for your tireless efforts on behalf of so many people. I wish you well. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Ignorance is bliss. Of all the diseases out there I think this would be the best to have for the individual. You feel no pain and the burden falls on the caretaker. My mom always loved to look good. Now that she's not aware of this preference I do it for her instead. My older sister always thinks how her appearance is not important but I told her that is so wrong. We must keep up what always mattered to her. Later on when we look back at her photos I don't want a single bad one in there to reflect on her poorly. That's the least I can do. But then I always told everyone that my wish is to die a minute before her so I will never have to be around to see her go.


 The one who goes first is the lucky one. The ones left behind are people who are emotionally scarred and lonely. I never understood people who want to live a long life. What's the point? I think the quality of life is so much more important. If you can be disease free, plenty of $, lots of family and friends around you then yes by all means live it up. Unfortunately not too many of those people around. My mom is very loved and she knows it. I sometimes think she chose to live in her own world to shut out all the unhappiness that surrounds her. Total denial city."
Need Information on Namenda,"Hi Everyone - My husband 51 years old is currently on Aricpt, Exelon and Namenda - Can you tell me what you know and have expereinced o this drug - He also has had neurological lyme disease - he has had that for 14 years total but only diagnosed wit it in 2002.

 Usually only 1 with Namenda.I tried Namenda & it was a disaster from the get go,at 2 months I was drooling like a baby barely knew what was going on.I finally threw it away & prayed I would get back to where I was before going on it & I did in time.......I took Aricept for 4 yrs but then It quit working so I asked for Razadyne(now generic Galentimine)


 Aricept,Exelon,Razadyne 1 of these 3 with Namenda......"
AD and TIAs,"My mom is 88 nearing end of moderate stage Alzheimer's. Yesterday morning, she began to have TIAs. We called 911 and took her over to the ER. I spent the next 27 hours in the hospital with her, first the ER and then she was admitted. She has had every conceivable test. She continues to have the TIAs. She can actually feel them coming on, starting with a headache and then her speech slurs and it goes away with 10 to 15 minutes. They have yet to figure out what's causing it. All mom wants to do is go home. I feel so bad for her. I stayed overnight with her because I didn't want her to freak out, being in a strange place. Neither of us slept very well but at least she remained calm. Just wondering if anyone else her has had experiences with TIAs? This is her first, as far as we know. Thanks, Miriam","TIAs are ""mini strokes""...a stroke causes permanent damage, TIA's come and go. They are affecting her right side. She hasn't lost use of her right side, just weak. Her right side of face is slightly off and when the TIA hits, her speech gets very slurred and then ten minutes later, all is ok. She had every conceivable test known to man...all came back negative. No blocks, no bleeds, no vessels collapsed. They ""think"" the mini strokes were caused by, are you ready? SUDAFED. She takes it daily...well, not any more. She's now back at assisted living. I spent the night in her room last night, hoping today she'd be acclimated, but she is not. She is more confused than normal. Just very sad Miriam


 I had a stroke 5 yrs ago,it left no residual affects...........


 Can you please tell me what TIA's are?


 Oh ok :) I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. I have no advice for you because my Gma didn't have this but I do often wonder if she had some sort of stroke because before she died, her left lip seemed to not match her right when she talked. I know my Gma would always be confused when we had to move her from either the hospital to the AL and visa versa. It's tough watching them with so much confusion."
Help with my Mom...please.,"Hello everyone. It's been about 8 months since I last posted. Things are getting worse with my Mom and I need suggestions. Here is the background on my situation. My Mom is 75 years old. She'll turn 76 in January. She has been having memory problems for well over 5 years. Three years ago she was diagnosed with AD. She has been on Aricept and Namenda for the past couple of years. I am her son (38 years old) and take care of her. We each own condo's in the same complex so it is easy for me to stop by daily and care for her. I make sure she takes her medicines, insulin, eye drops...I take her grocery shopping, I do her laundry, etc. Last winter she started having very paranoid thoughts. First it was her doctors were doing inappropriate things to her (we never leave her alone with her doctors). Then it was her neighbors being mad at her. The it was directed at my sister. She thought my sister stole $600 from her. Of course this didn't happen. My Mom had hidden the money and I found it. Even though I explained that to her, it didn't help. This ""episode"" lasted almost 4 months. Well, things were better this spring and summer. I took Mom to the beach and she had a WONDERFUL time. Things were even great between her and my sister. But this weekend, she had a new paranoid thought - that my sister had stolen some of her clothes. She even remembers seeing my sister in a store wearing her clothes. She says my sister laughed in her face. Again, this is absurd. My sister is in her early 40's and is not even the same size as my Mom. And, the only time my Mom gets out to a store is if I take her and this never happend. My Mom has been VERY upset...angry...sad. She is now directing it at me too. She thinks she saw me and my sister talking and laughing. (I haven't seen my sister in over two weeks.) She is so angry at me now too. She gets very dramatic. Eight months ago we started my Mom on Serequel which is an ant-psychotic medication. We started her at 25mg. She is now taking 200mg. It helped before, but I don't see it helping anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to handle this situation. I feel so scared and alone. Even though I have 7 brothers and sisters, me and my sister are really the only two that are involved in caring for mom. And now with her being angry at my sister, it all falls on me. One of my other sisters has started helping with dinners, which is wonderful, but I still feel fully responsible. I want to ""fix"" this situation, and I know I can't. I have prayed to God to help me through this. I am very lucky that Mom sleeps very well at night and usually is only upset during the day. (I know this is different from most AD patients.) Does anyone have any suggestions. Have you all experienced this with your loved ones as well? How do you all find the strength to cope. I am a nervous wreck, I don't sleep at night and also have a stressful full time job to deal with. Help...","Thanks Sis Great input from Rosie already so I will just ask that you do keep us up to date on whats going on and know that I too had a family like yours .......No one did anything but Cait and I ......... I am sorry for what you are going thru God BLess LYN


 Can you take her out more?Do you have a lake where there are ducks,geese,swans? Get some corn & help her feed them I do this every day,& it's a great stress buster........Makes my day.


 Hello, I'm not sure if this fits this but...my mom has been yelling about missing some of her clothes. And she has been yelling indirectly at me. There is a lock on her door, only she has the key and still she is missing clothing. Lately I have been losing weight so I am now able to fit into some of my older clothes and when she looked at me she thinks that those were once her clothes. She shops in the same places and in the junior section too so our clothes do at times appear the same. There have been times when she would give me a shirt then turn around and told me I stole it from her. Because of this I try not to take anything from her but she then gets mad if I refuse. If I tell her when to pick me up some times she forgets as soon as i walk away. She is beginning to mix up words like saying brake when she means gas. Is there something else going on here? This woouldn't be the first time she as accused someone of stealing, but...I don't know what to do. Is there something else wrong with her brain, or...I don't know. Any help would be appreciated.


 Hi Rob My friend has sick (Alz) old mother. But he supports her constantly. I do not know how to transmit to you the information?


 My mom was given seroquel before and she would get nightmares. The kind where she would scream bloody murder. I lived in an apartment before and that was never fun. I'm surprised no one ever called the cops. Anti-psychotic meds are dangerous as far as I'm concerned and I don't think they do any good.


 Hi Rob, You are such a dear son to take on this huge responsibility. There is usually one in each family who will ""step up"" and make sure things get done. We lost my dad in January and we had some similary scenarios where he could not tolerate one of my brothers and one of my sisters. But that still left 5 of us to help out. Mom was actually the main caretake (thank God) and I was the one coming in two or more days a week to get her out of the house to get a break. Long story short, I finally made a schedule of Saturdays where each sibling took a certain Saturday of the month and I took any fifth Saturday. With this schedule we always knew, without a calendar, what day we were responsible to go to mom's house and spend a few hours with dad so she get out to do shopping and visit frieds. It worked very well, but NO ONE helped until the schedule was made. I included a note on the schedule about Mom's need for companionship and respite and I also asked that if anyone could not do their Saturday, that they contact another sibling to switch days. I was absolutely amazed (and thankful) that it worked so well. Each family seems to find their own way . . . but don't wait for them to ""step up"". The sister who your mom doesn't trust can do shopping and cleaning and help with the food prep ect. Everyone can do something. If you keep an ongoing list of things you need help with, the others will learn to look for the list or ask about the list. Its amazing. I don't know a whole lot about the psychotic episodes . . . Dad did have some of the too and we did our best to work around it. I hope you'll keep us updated. Your solutions will be invaluble to others so make sure you let us know how you manage this. Hugs and Blessings!


 Alzheimer's pass through this stage. There is a significnat personality changes and idisyncratic behavior evolve. They become, apathetic, withdrawn, anxious and agitated. They are suspicious, panoid; may accuse spouse of having an affair, or accuse family member of stealing. Keep in mind that these problems are due to the disease and are not done in purpose. Learn ways to cope wiht these situations and avoid mkaing them worse. an gaitated tone can upset your loved one, a calm tone can reassure. avoid arguing with reality. She might be confused and not be able to separate past from present and she might even forget who you are. if you can play along you may spare both of your frustrations


 Nova Rob How are things going Please keep posting and let us know how you and your mom are doing LYN

Alzheimer WEbsite,"Hello, I have just read something about a new drug against Alzheimer's. It should VerbID study with the nuns have been developed and is called Old-OCW-Clear-Wise. Has anyone already tried this medication? I ask because this looks very promising. Have read about it in nonnenstudie.com. Thanks in advance.

Here is what stood out : ""For 0.69 euros a day make sure you get your entire annual requirement of Old-Clear-Wise. =_tipon(this) onmouseout=_tipoff()> Dies sind 69 Cent am Tag Ihre Gesundheit. These are 69 cents on the day of your health."" I did not find anything promising on this site except a price list of all the product that were for sale. This is one I would be very careful about the claims on this site before ordering. Take care and I know how desperate many are for the miracle drug for this dang disease. With great respect, Kitt


 Right now there is Razadyne,Aricept,Exelon & Namenda for Alzheimer's.They do not cure it but they do help........


 Hello Renato and welcome to HealingWell. I went into the website and it is in a different language than English. I sure wish that it was in English so that most of our members could read it though. Again welcome............


 Hi michelle I think there is many medicines that can help alzheimers but no cure yet. One day we will find that oblusive product that will be the cure. I do agree in looking at the site that treatment of alzheimers should start at a early age. Iam taking colostrinin which like ocw helps on inflamation and have had no side effects,Iam youngish in my 40s Ihave seen what happened with my grandmother when she eventually died of alzheimers and prefer to take something to help delay getting alzheimers .


 snowylynne True all these helps alzheimers but I cant afford these drugs not with a family of 6 (all girls.) Why are drugs so expensive in the first place ,Ican understand companies need to make a profit but should it be to those who have no choice but to pay up ."
caregiver question,"my mother has dementia, along with other illnesses......she cannot be left alone and is almost bedreddin.....my father works 3 days a week, and isnt exactly in great health either.....i have fibro and cfs, and do what i can to help.....my sister works fulltime as a cna....is there any way or agency out there that would allow her to care for my mother fulltime and get paid for it?.......any info would be greatly appreciated..thankyou,....dutchone","Check with the county office on aging where your parents live. I understand what you are going through and you absolutely must get help. I too have fibro plus other bad pain and both my parents have Alzheimer's and live in an assisted living with an aide. It is so difficult to understand and deal with. The main thing is to get the help and take good care of yourself. Good luck with everything!


 Where do you live? I know here in Michigan, if someone cares for a person who has a disability they can get paid by the government - it's not a lot but it's something. Also too, you may want to ask this question to your mother's insurance company (she does have insurance?).


 Totally agree with Red on this check out insurance policies..hoping she has one....here in Ontario the home care has to come in tried to hv daughter get some monies for all she has done since my hospitilization but to no avail they want to send in home care..i am retired reg geriatric nurse so i dont know why my insurance or workmans comp wont cover it..disabilty does...hmmm"

Need input on the treatment of AD related aggression,"Greetings all, First-timer here. I need some input please. I was informed today by my mother's nursing home that due to Mom's increased aggression towards other residents in her nursing home, we either have to start her immediately on the drug Neurontin and get her aggression under control, or she will have to be moved to a psychiatric hospital. Last Friday, they also told me that she has ""Sundown Syndrome."" IS there anything else, some other method, some other way, some other drug?? She has congestive heart failure and the info I have seen on this drug, Neurontin, indicates it isn't recommended for patients with heart conditions. I feel like they are rushing me. Like I have been given an ultimatum, ""do this or else!"" And I don't think it is the best option for her!! Any suggestions?? Thank you for any information you are kind enough to share.","I wasn't aware that they used Neurontin for AD related aggression. I take Neurontin for nerve pain related issues. Has she been seen by her doctor? If not, do not take the recommendation of a nursing home but rather her doctor. There are a few medications out there that can help with AD. My grandmother is on Namenda for hers. There is also Aricept that has been shown be a good medication. My grandmother also has Sundowners. This is a chemical imbalance in their brain that is affected by cloudy and rainy weather. It typically affects the person's mind after sundown. The sun is sort of ""feel well and stablizing"" sort of thing for them. When it goes down, it affects their mind. It is actually pretty typical with dementia and Alzheimers.


 Many people think that calming Alzheimer's medicines are just heavy duty tranquilizers, they fear that giving their loved ones these medicines will turn them into ""zombies"" who cannot think, feel or communicate. However, many calming medications actually give them a new lease on their lives by enabling them to approach problems and memory-related frustrations with little more equilibrium. Calming medicines for them serve one ultimate function is to calm the patient and prevent from injuring themselves or others, and these meds can help them continue to focus and function on their daily routines, and from harming themselves and those around them... there are different types of medications that are used to calm Alzheimer's patients. They say drugs used to treat schizophrenia can also help limit patients aggression and the idea that people are out to get them...


 Ativan can cause worseing of the disease....


 I would refuse her being taken off Aricept/Namenda.......Sounds like she's doing good on them....Seroquel is a good substitue for ativan.It should calm her but not make her a zombie.Just remember it takes time to get into the system.........


 I was on Seroquel for 2 months for serious agitation due to an inept caregiver at a rehab my hubby was in after knee surgery.......I have vascular Dementia but at the time we were told I had AD,which wasn't so.I asked my Neuro to be retested & he agreed I was doing too well for AD.....I now take Galentimine(generic Razadyne)It works for me......


 Ativan is in the Benzo family NOT good for dementia of any type......


 ..Like SHERRY ..I have not heard of neurotin being used for AD patient and agression issues..i too take it for nerve pain...i hope you will continue to keep us posted on your Mom and what is going on with her...huggles..lyn


 Is she on Seroquel??


 I'm on Galentimine(Razadyne)


 Thank you all!! Can't think where my other response went. I understand about the ""zombie"" part. I also don't want what has always made Mom unique (on SOOO many levels) to be squashed. Since she is too far gone into the ""sundowner's"" and the aggession to try a non-pharmeceutical approach, we have determined that for now we will try using Zolaft daily and Ativan as needed. Not happy about it, but really had no choice but to proceed with pharmeceutical intervention. They also mentioned taking her off her Aricpet and Namenda because ""it reaches the point where it doesn't work any more."" This I know also, but who or what determines when it's ""not working anymore??"" Mom is still thrilled by the beauty of things around her, still loves to shop, still loves a good cup of tea, and a good meal eaten with her family. Sounds to me like she isn't past the point of the meds working. I am also taking her for a psych evaluation with a psychiatrist. Any ideas, input or suggestions on the Aricept/Namenda Thanking you all, I remain M. A.


 I know, but they didn't seem to have an alternative and they PROMISED it would only be used ""as needed"", like when the aggression seems to have reached the point where she is going to lash out at a resident. Since they haven't been able to keep her calm, I am wondering if they will be a:) able to get to her in time, and b:) make her TAKE the med as it is an oral medication. We will have to wait and see. What would be a good altenative to Ativan?? Thanking you for your assistance, I remain, M.A.


 Thank you, Snowylynne. So far, I have managed to resist taking her off the Aricept/Namenda. I have told them until she is apparently NOT enjoying anything, we are going to keep her on it. She is failing quickly now that her roommate passed away. They were attached at the hip and I know that Mom misses her. Her roommate was so lively and kept Mom going. To point out the hallucinations mom is having, they tell me Mom walks up and down the hallway alone, talking to somebody who isn't there. HELLO! She's doing the same thing she did everyday up to the point her roommate passed. Mom is walking with her and talking with her, I'm sure. BTW, they have told me Mom is at stage 6. You mentioned the Seroquel in a previous email. I didn't realize you were suggesting it as an alternative to the Ativan. They are only suggesting the Ativan specifically for those times she needs it. Which hasn't been any time since the incident two Fridays ago. I will research the Seroquel as an alternative. Do you have any particular information regarding the Seroquel as opposed to the Ativan. If not, do you know a good site that may have the information?? As always, I appreciate the advice and the information. I remain, M.A.


 Greetings all, Just wanted to update on my Mom and her situation. Aside from her ""aggression"" issues, the facility waited till she had lost 15 lbs before telling me that she wasn't eating at all. As I mentioned above, I suggested Zoloft for her. This poor woman has suffered from depression since her 40's and because of the ""stigma"" of the era, never did anything about it. I do not know if at any time prior to me taking over her medical care, antidepressants were suggested by her Dr. Probably not, as I have no high opinion of his medical skills, but Mother has been known to get home from the Dr's and THROW OUT any written prescript ions he may have given her.....so I will give the Dr. the benefit of the doubt. Since I took over her medical care in 2000, I have asked and asked and ASKED for an antidepressant for her and finally, in 2009 .. SOMEONE listened! She has been taking Zoloft since October and it is now the end of December and they have only had recourse to the Ativan THREE times. I am quite pleased. She seems happier and more lively mentally and that is FABULOUS! Also, I did take over her menus and so far, it seems that all is going well and she is eating again. The facility is giving me full credit for her increased appetite. I think it is the Zoloft (who wants to eat when they're depressed?) but if they want to give me credit for the change, who am I to argue? So Mom is doing better mentally with no major psychotics being used frequently. She and her new roommate are getting along famously, but there is no replacement for her old roommate and I can see her failing physically. She has given up tapdancing for the residents. But she is 87 and even she admits she is getting old, God bless her heart. For all who responded and offered their assistance, I give you my sincere thanks for your efforts on my mom's behalf. I appreciate it so much. Sincerely, M.A.


 I am so happy to hear your mom is doing better..i hv to agree with snowy on the ativan though there are other meds that wont cause as many problems with ad peeps as ativan does..keep us posted..lyn"
"Quick Facts ,Information..Warning Signs..Alzheimer's Disease / Check it out","Should we screen for Alzheimer's disease? Fewer than one-half of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are currently diagnosed; approximately 25% are treated with antidementia compounds. Screening has been proposed to help combat underdiagnosis of AD. An emerging consensus suggest that the three keys to the successful treatment of Alzheimer's disease are early detection, use of currently approved medications to provide symptomatic treatment, and development of medications to slow and eventually halt disease progression. I think this would rellay be a good idea and may help with early DX of the AD Any Comments or input?? LYN","Thanks Lyn . . . this is a great topic . . . I'm watching with great interest as I fear for my own mind. *sigh* I think it will be a great topic for newbies too. Some people just want to get a sense of what the beginning signs are. I have read that one of the earliest symptoms is inability to smell citrus or natural gas smells. Sounds weird but I actually get some degree of reassurance from this one as my sense of smell is still very good. As I remember, my dad lost his sense of smell well before his dx.

I know you are struggling with your health and your spare time . . . . you do a fantastic job here!!! (((((((( Lyn )))))))))))) Blessings!

 Just heard today that taking IBRUPROFEN at an early age ( 20's) daily can help with the onset of Alzheimer's..........it was on CNN


 HI Yes it is where they will come into periods of Lucidity and then out again.......... There isnt too much on the net but from experience with dad I knew he had this from yrs ago and it took some time to go directly to AD Take care sis


 NO problem Red I have seen this in NH 's as well it is sad but it happens YES I know I worry too becuase I am already having forgetting issues but the doc re assures me it is the Fibro Plus I believe for me Ativan /Lorazepam does work on making my short term memory really bad ........ Take care I so admire you for what you are doing with and for your GMA


 Exciting research being done to hopefully TRY and find a cure for AD.... Check out the link and see you may have to copy to browser...... http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-health/20080622/SCI.Alzheimer_s.Clue/


 I popped over here due to my grandmother's strange inability to hold on to things like her dentures and glasses. She has good days and then she has bad days where she can't remember anything. I was her caregiver until she fell. The doctor said she had to go to a nursing home. Now I go every weekend and she seems to be going downhill fast. Thanks for the info. I suspect AD. I am going to watch her closer now that I know all the signs.


 ALZHEIMER""S is NOT a Single Gene Disorder Diseases such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease are single-gene disorders. If a person inherits the gene that causes one of these disorders, he or she surely will get the disease, unless it is prevented by other means. AD, on the other hand, is not a single-gene disorder. More than one gene mutation can cause AD, and genes on multiple chromosomes are involved. Sometimes, two genes--one from each parent--are needed for a person to get the disorder. The two basic types of AD are familial and sporadic. Familial AD (FAD) is a rare form of AD, affecting less than 10 percent of AD patients. It is associated with gene mutations on chromosomes 1, 14, and 21. FAD is the result of a certain inheritance pattern called autosomal dominant. In this pattern, all offspring in the same generation have a 50/50 chance of developing AD if 1 of their parents had it. FAD occurs in younger people (usually before age 60) than sporadic AD does.

 ....TTT for new members


 I have been taking care of a friend of mine that was diagnoised with alzheimers disease 4 years ago. She is on the medications razadyne, namenda and seroquel. she had gotten so out of hand the dr. i take her to for the alzheimers said she needed to be on serquel to calm her down. she would get so angry. she would walk up and down the street until the neighbors would call the police on her even though she was not doing anything. she would hit her caregivers, she just didn't want anyone in her house taking over. since she has been on the serquel she is very calm. She is constantly having different symtoms and i just wanted to see if anyone else has anyone with these. Alice's face gets very red in the evenings with no reason, she always throws up 2 or 3 times a day. her hair is starting to come out. her teeth are decaying, she is losing weight. she has not spoken a word in 2 years now. her neurologist said she has aphasia which is loss of speech. I have gotten her home health care after trying for 2 years. she now has a great caregiver who takes great care of her. i still give her meds and buy her groceries and take her to the dr. and other things for her. i tried for 2 yrs to get her help and even though she couldn't speak, they said she did't qualify, i finally wrote someone in Austin and it took me another 2 weeks and they finally approved her for homehealth care. she has had this for 2 years now. they have raised her hrs after i told them she is unable to feed, dress, clean house cook, wash clothes or anything anymore. now she is getting 46 hrs a week and we get respite care also.they tried to tell me if she is not bedridden she couldn't get any hrs over 20. this is until they saw her. now they understand. sometimes she still gets really angry, i just wanted to see if anyone else had the same problems that i have.I have found a dr who does research on alzheimer patients. she is in the medical center in houston. it took me months to get her into it. her appointment is not until Feb.2009 But i will take anything i can get, just to see if maybe she has something else. she will have a kinds of testing done on her and the dr. is supposed to be one of best in her field, so i'll see what happens in feb.


 Thank-you Lyn. All of this has been very helpful. As you know, I am caring for my Dad, I don't really understand the ""stages"" and could use some coaching on that. The single biggest problem I have is his anger. Yes, he has lost a lot: His wife (nursing home), his vehicle, his license, and his self-respect. I have lost a lot too. My freedom to come and go, my ability to work, private time, privacy, friends, and so on. I get so dog-gone angry when he gets angry because everything he wants and needs, I provide for him. All the special foods he likes, special soap, a neck warmer, warm clothers, and on and on. i went yesterday to get a part to fix the muffler on the car and he had a massive tantrum. I was only going to be gone a half hour at most and quite frankly, I'm worried about the exhaust fumes rising up into the car because I smell it, it's carbon monoxide and highly dangerous. I have to have all windows open until I get it fixed. He throws a fit because he's left behind for 1/2 hr. while I see about this. He complains if a window is down even an inch. You see the delemma? I am gettinnng tired of him. I have to say that. It's all his way or no way. i went to pick up a christmas tree and got a madman blowing my horn in the car like the house was on fire. Aside from being irritating, it's getting harder and harder for me to ""keep it together"". I'm short tempered. My son is available to come up today and I caný afford the gas to go get him. He could take the pressure off for a bit. Thank-you for listening.

 Thanks Lyn, My hubbies Grandmother had AD and it was so sad as she knew nobody for several years and did not even recognize her children. My MIL tried to keep her at home but she has crippling arthritis and could not continue. Grandma went to Nursing home and my MIL went everyday to spend the afternoon from lunch time on with her. We would go and see her too. She lived well into her 80's. God Bless you Lyn for all you do with this forum Hugs Kitt


 Lil sis Smell is one of the biggies IMHO As posted both parents lost theirs Mine is still sniffing out all the "" bad "" smells "" lol I swear I say ""WHAT is that smell at least 50 times a day Take care lil sis and thanks for your love and support... I really DO love this forum and doing what I can to make awareness and helping out others in situations they are in Luvs Big sis


 What exactly is sporadic AZ? Is this where they have spells of dementia but can revert back to their own self on occasion? I tried finding out what it meant on the net but I didn't find much.


 Thanks for clarifying that for me Lyn :)


 Also there was a ? about the NON ability to smell gas and other things That IMHO is so true This is the reason ( one anyways) that you really have to watch loved ones in their homes and in yours especially with gas appliances.......... And they tend to lean over stove with long sleeve on ( omg I thought dad was gonna burn up once) with the burner on This was so out of character for him as he was always yelling at us kids about the stove pilot light and making sure burners were off He still was smelling gas all the time...I would have to take him and show him it was off Eventually I took knobs off the stove and blew out pilot lights it was that scary .......


 Keeping Your Mind Healthy If you hope to maintain cognitive function as long as possible, there are a number of lifestyle measures that may be protective, according to the Alzheimer's Association: Stay socially and mentally connected . Keep tabs on your cholesterol level and blood pressure readings to keep them in the normal ranges . High levels of cholesterol and high blood pressure boost the risk of dementia. Manage your body weight . Obesity in middle age doubles the risk of dementia later. Adopt a brain-healthy diet. Eat more vegetables and less fat. Pick dark-skinned fruits and vegetables, which have the highest levels of natural antioxidants -- for instance, kale, spinach, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, beets, red bell peppers, prunes, raisins, blueberries, blackberries and plums. These are the main points to help keep mind active Especially having a SOCIAL Life


 I am so sorry my friend 'It sure is hard when this happens I am really glad you are keeping up the visists with her in NH 'HAVE you checked out that particuliar on in Nursing Home thread it gives you the ratings and info about NH' I will bump it up for you Love and keep me posted God Bless you and your sweet GMA..........LYN


 GENES Like recipes, genes provide instructions about how to make something, indicating what ingredients go in and in what order. But, the environment (things outside the body like food, the air we breathe, or chemicals we are exposed to) and processes inside the body determine which ingredients are available and in what forms and quantities. Along with environmental influences, genes and processes inside the body combine to do more than just determine eye and hair color and other traits inherited from our parents. For example, genes ensure that we have two hands and can use them to do things, like play the piano. In almost every case, nature (genes) and nurture (including the physical and chemical environment) work together to shape all living things. Genes alone are not all-powerful. Most genes can do little until spurred on by other substances. Although they are necessary in their own right, genes basically wait inside the cell's nucleus (control center) for other molecules to come along and read their messages. Each of these messages is used to build a certain protein. Genes may build a protein correctly or incorrectly, depending on the content of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) message. A gene can produce a faulty protein if it has one or more mutations (defects) in its DNA. Faulty proteins can lead to cell malfunction, disease, and death. You can go to a Geneologist and have self screened to see what role your genes play in the AD......... I have had mom and step dad pass from this DD and I am going to be screened for sure as I have fibro and the memory loss is scaring me at my age 54 ........

Lewy Bodies & Hospice,"Mother is actually doing better at times with hospice care at her nursing home. The last ""family"" conference (me) was about putting her on hospice to get her additional attention and hence, mental stimulation. Had no idea it would work so well and so soon. With Lewy Bodies dimentia, she will never get better and only continue to go downhill. With the added help, I find mother out in the social area of her wing more often and much more aware of what's going on. Last visit, she even asked about some relatives. This is no cure, but making her days better for her. There continue to be times of passing consciousness but much less. Hospice doesn't mean the end, but a more pleasant existence. linda","That's wonderful ! You have such a great attitude. It's about giving your mom the dignity she deserves and finding some joy in those ""window of opportunity"" moments that come and go. Grab them ! All we have is this moment because no one of us REALLY knows what is coming next."
What Is Alzheimer's Disease and Effects ...........,"..........What is Alzheimer's Disease In Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, problems with memory, judgment, and thought processes make it hard for a person to work and take part in day-to-day family and social life. Changes in mood and personality also may occur. These changes can result in loss of self-control and other problems. Some 2 to 4 million persons have dementia associated with aging. Of these individuals, as many as two-thirds have Alzheimer's disease. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease at this time, it may be possible to relieve some of the symptoms, such as wandering and incontinence. The earlier the diagnosis, the more likely your symptoms will respond to treatment. Talk to your doctor as soon as possible if you think you or a loved one is showing signs of AD Who is Afected The chances of getting Alzheimer's disease increase with age. It usually occurs after age 65. Most people are not affected even at advanced ages. There are only two definite factors that increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease: a family history of dementia and Down syndrome. Family History Of Dementia Some forms of Alzheimer's disease are inherited. If Alzheimer's disease has occurred in your family members, other members are more likely to develop it. Discuss any family history of dementia with your family doctor. What Are The Signs Of Alzheimer's Disease? The classic sign of early Alzheimer's disease is gradual loss of short-term memory. Other signs include: Problems finding or speaking the right word. Inability to recognize objects. Forgetting how to use simple, ordinary things, such as a pencil. Forgetting to turn off the stove, close windows, or lock doors. Mood and personality changes also may occur. Agitation, problems with memory, and poor judgment may cause unusual behavior. These symptoms vary from one person to the next. Symptoms appear gradually in persons with Alzheimer's disease but may progress more slowly in some persons than in others. In other forms of dementia, symptoms may appear suddenly or may come and go. If you have some of these signs, THIS DOES NOT MEAN you have Alzheimer's disease. Anyone can have a lapse of memory or show poor judgment now and then. When such lapses become frequent or dangerous, however, you should tell your doctor about them immediately. I will be doing more input on Alzheimers causes effects and other DD that can occur or lead to Alzheimer's","....To the top for Wiggy

Power of Touch and Other  Ideas..........For Caregivers of Their Loved Ones,"PLEASE Do Reach Out and Touch Them ...Acknowledge Them ..They Know..IMHO AND They So Desrve Respct and Dignity Shown to Them All individuals, regardless of age or abilities, have the need for touch and love and the desire for companionship. Touch is a human need and personalizes caregiving. People respond to touch depending upon their upbringing and self-image. A touch can convey compassion, not just sexual interest. It can convey reassurance (as a gentle stroking of the forearm), safety (as an arm around the shoulder) or relaxation (as a shoulder massage) among other feelings. Take out old family photos and go thru them with them telling them who they are OR seeing if they still can remember some of the ppl in the pics....... Doing big puzzles with them also keeps their minds active and that is truly need IMHO,if you are left with nothing to think abiut you will get stagnant and go further into sellf making self more prone to quick downfall in the dang disease If they like to play cards make huge ones out of bristol board and they can still try and play ( it doesnt matter if they get it right ..IT matters that they are being shown and given attention) the GK's and GGK's can play with them ..Take for walks out to see th flowers and let them touch them.............. smell them ......they need this Caregivers have the ability to show the loved ones by just touching them hugging them and sitting to listen to them talk about whatever even if it doesnt make sense to you ....I do not believe in outright lying but I do believe in going to where they are in their world ..obviously I am talking about those not in the last stages but I truly believe we can slow down the progression of this DD by showing and giving more of ourselves to them However you cope with the changes in your loving relationship, you may be able to find additional emotional support and relationships in friends and family, children, pets, and coworkers/volunteers. The Power of Touch All individuals, regardless of age or abilities, have the need for touch and love and the desire for companionship. Touch is a human need and personalizes caregiving. People respond to touch depending upon their upbringing and self-image. A touch can convey compassion, not just sexual interest. It can convey reassurance (as a gentle stroking of the forearm), safety (as in an arm around the shoulder) Encourage family members and guests to face their elder when talking to him/her. This is an essential skill for hearing-impaired or demented elderly. Gently massage some lightly scented lotion on your loved one’s hands and feet. Yeah, old people’s feet get gnarly, because/so they don’t get touched often. Have a podiatrist take care of nail clipping and necessary medical procedures. Whenever you sit or stand with your loved one, retain physical contact by holding his/her hand or arm. This also can help to orient a demented or sight-impaired person. Avoid signs and actions that show your discomfort or repulsion to your loved one’s ailment(s). People are very conscious of the way that other people perceive them and take on negative frames of mind.

 POWER OF TOUCH..............................GOES A LONG WAY IMHO AND IN OTHER'S OPINIONS All individuals, regardless of age or abilities, have the need for touch and love and the desire for companionship. Touch is a human need and personalizes caregiving. People respond to touch depending upon their upbringing and self-image. A touch can convey compassion, not just sexual interest. It can convey reassurance (as a gentle stroking of the forearm), safety (as an arm around the shoulder) or relaxation (as a shoulder massage) among other feelings. So often we rely on the ""miracles of modern medicine"" and technological solutions to the stresses of aging and physical illness (and even spiritual/emotional losses). Most religions have traditions of the healing and curative powers of touch. These traditions can be interpreted as myth or fact. Yet even modern science recognizes the importance of human interaction and physical contact. Touching or massage can promote physiological responses such as decreased nervous tension, decreased muscle contractions, increased circulation, and decreased heart rate and blood pressure. Ten years ago as I watched a good friend of mine die of AIDS. As David’s disease progressed he suffered from terribly disfiguring Kaposi’s sarcoma. People avoided him on the street and averted their eyes. In the days before he died, I made a conscious effort to face him as I spoke and rest my hand on his knee or shoulder when we sat together. At times this was not easy for me. I did not – could not – cure his disease. But I know that I made a difference in his frame of mind, especially given his own perception of himself as ""untouchable."" When I volunteered as a Long-Term Care Ombudsman at a nursing home, I frequently found myself sitting and talking with residents. THEY reached out to touch me – grasping my arm (sometimes bone-crunching!), tapping my knee and even kissing my hand. People in residential settings are not solely ""patients"" – they need attention and affection more than ever before. Caregivers have a great opportunity to enhance the well-being of their loved ones by being more conscious of the power that they hold in the fingertips. I have included a few additional examples: Encourage family members and guests to face their elder when talking to him/her. This is an essential skill for hearing-impaired or demented elderly. Gently massage some lightly scented lotion on your loved one’s hands and feet. Yeah, old people’s feet get gnarly, because/so they don’t get touched often.

 Thanks my friend I sure do miss them I cherish each day I had with them Lyn


 PLEASE do check the Alzheimer's Resources and you will find plenty there to help you and loved one on this journey MAY your God Go with you Luvs LYN"
Mom's day,"Hi There, I am not new to this site, normally on the fibro forum. My mom has Alzheimer's. She was diagnosed six years ago. I cared for her in my home for one year, until I just could not do it any longer, I guess I am not emotionally strong enough and I really had a melt down. My sister (I have two) volunteered to take mom and mom has been there since. As many of you know, it simply isn't easy to care for someone with dementia. Mom has been declining and it is getting more difficult. She does have an aide that comes to my sister's home six days a week, and on Sundays, my other sister and I pick up my mom and take her out for the day. It's been this way for the past six years. Over the weekend, I received a call from my sister who cares for mom saying she took mom to an assisted living facility, one that my other sister works at, she's an RN, and my mom fell in love with the place and asked ""when can I move in?"" Long story short, today is moving day. I am very excited for my mom and yet I also feel I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. With everything I have heard from people about ""the move"" I have such a knot in my stomach and yet mom is nothing but happy and excited. One can only hope this excitement lasts after she's moved in and we have to leave. I'm just asking for some little prayers from you that all goes well and that I have the strength to get through this. It seems with every decline in my mom, I have felt a loss, losing her bit by bit and I think this is just another step in that process. Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled for my sister. Anyway, I think those of you that have been in my shoes understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks for listening/reading, Miriam","My Gma was the same way. She really like the assisted living center (and she still does) but she had some anxiety when she realized that I wasn't staying with her. That lasted for about 6 months and now she is in the swing of things. She still calls me to be sure I'm ok (she worries herself to death about me sometimes) and I have to keep reassuring her that things are fine. She knows that I am but a phone call away and I think that helped ease her mind as well. Good luck to you, your mom and sisters and I hope her move is uneventful."
"Avoiding ""Burn Out"" Do something for yourself each day","For all caregivers,there comes a time when you will suffer from ""burn out"" and you will need to be able to acknowledge this and do something about it .For me its a little bit short fused...........especially when other family members dont understand why you are not putting your mom or whoever in a home (make it easier on yourself they say).Crying for no reason is another sign for me,although I know it is for a reason.I find that if I just take 20 30 minutes each day and go for a walk or have a hot tub I will be recharged and ready to go another day.You have to give yourself some TLC in order to be able to give it to those you are caring for .............What do you do for yourself?","I had burnout 3 times in 30 years of working.I know what's it's like,it's horrible.Take time for yourself,If you have someone come in several times a week,get out & do something nice for yourself,go to a movie,a nice lunch,visit a friend or whatever you want,just don't stay home.


 SL..............I remember those ""burn outs ""all to well. Sadly I saw a couple of really caring,loving and skilled RNs get so bad that they got into pills and ultimately overdosed.I went to the funeral of one girl Cathy 30 yrs old(16 yrs ago) and that was so difficult to see.Her family knew nothing of her problems .they were just left with so many questions.,and no answers.This happens way to often but goes unreported..................................You are absolutely right .take a bath,go to a movie and for sure have someone come in for respite care;Get out of the house if only for awhile and you will be better to look after yourself and those you love .Take Care and God Bless you and Larry

 I know this isn't quite on subject but it is from my perspective: My mom is the caregiver and I have reminded her to keep a list of things she needs done around the house and post it so that when I, my brothers or sisters are there we can help her with these things. We are in the habbit of looking for that list and we kindly scold her if it is empty. It is a way for her to ask for help without feeling like a begger. I have also called my siblings to arrange a time for one to visit with dad while other(s) of us take mom on an outing. We think we are going to make a schedule of this so that she does not have to ask. I give her every Monday and one sister gives her every Wednesday (mom's choice of days) so she can remain active at the senior center. If you know a caretaker . . . treat them special!! You can give your approval of putting the loved one with AD in a home but don't use it as an excuse to bow out of helping. If you are not the primary caretaker and not the person with AD . . . please help these 'gifts from God' to get a break. Blessings!


 AR.In my opinion you and your siblings are doing exactly what a family should do when they have a loved one with AD.Making the lists and making sure that you give your Mom some ""free time"" is wonderful.I commend you and your family for going that extra mile,it makes all the difference in the world.More families need to do something similiar for their loved ones...........................Basically you are all pitching in and yet are able to have some time to do stuff for yourselves and in my opinion this makes it better so that yous do not start to resent your loved one for needing you so much and you avoid the ""burn out"" GREAT JOB........God Bless and Keep You and Your Family Safe and Healthy

New to Group - Dad in 2nd? Stage,"I looked for a forum where I might be able to talk with others in a similar situation. I noticed symptoms with my Dad about 4 or so years ago and when I first mentioned this to my Mom and my sister, they were in denial. I believe he has now reached possibly what is called the 2nd stage; however, I'm not certain about that. My mother is 89 and my Dad 90. They still live alone by choice; however, my mother is now becoming frightened as she is crippled. While I just turned 62, I am not in a position financially to give up my job . . . 2 job losses in a period of 3 years and the dramatic decrease in my IRA in this financial crisis has cost me money that I needed for my own future . . . (I am single, self-supporting.) My mother doesn't want to put him in a nursing home and refuses to move to an Assisted Care Facility. My Dad at a point where he is still not totally out of it and when my Mom tried to tell him that we have a volunteer coming in to be with him when she went shopping, he went ballistic. Today I woke up to a note from her saying that my Dad asked her if she had any nickels and dimes and when she asked what he wanted them for, he told her he wanted to eat them. She keeps asking me what to do and I'm just as without a clue as she is.","I received a lot of help from the Alzheimer's Association. Their website is www.alz.org . They even have a hotline you or your mom can call. I wish you well, Miriam


 P.S. to this post He was taking Aricept but last October stopped taking it as he believes a doctor told him he no longer needed any pills.

A new report from the Alzheimers Society of USA has found that more than 5 million ppl now do suffer with this DD.....Mind robbing disease...this represents approximetaly a 10% increase from 5 yrs ago and the numbers have Horribly doubled since 1980 according to the study released from the Alzheimer's Association of America 1 out of every 8 ppl over the age of 65 now has this disease:: this includes the half over 85 with it as well Between 2000 and 2004 Alzheimer deaths or deaths associated with AD had rose 33% This is a real startling amount of PPL and it really hit a chord with me ......... Scientists do predict that7.7 million ppl that are above age 65 plus will have this disease UNLESS new research is being done The President of the American AD Association says there is HOPE Right now there are 9 drugs in Clininical Trials for AD.....that with newer more advanced Diagnostic tools may have the potential to change the ways that this disease is growing and contiuing to grow at a very alarming rate ....... You can read about more of this in the resources and clinical trial going on right now I pray fervently that some day we can do something about this disease that literally ROBS us of our loved ones God Bless LYN,"There are also many under the age of 65 being dx with AD,FTD,& Vascular dementia.


 This DD makes me so angry at times and other times I am so sad for what I ahve seen and for what has become of my Dad it is so hard to see him this way but I know I could not have him away from me

I'm fine too & wil ask my Neuro for a pet scan with contrast medium.He can always say no,lol. May even go back on the Razadyne too.Neuro said when we think i'm ready he'll fix it up.


 This number of people afflicted with Alzheimer's was posted about ten mths ago.........Can you imagine the numbers now of ppl with AD,even with research and meds sometimes it is caught too late in the stages to do anything We have to help as much as we can too support our Local Alzheimers Society and the fundraising events they do for Research.......... Our Seniors and loved ones do deserve this ........IMHO........ LYN

 Alzheimer's disease affects approximately 5 million people in the U.S.1 It's a progressive disease that affects the brain and can result in: Loss of memory Loss of ability to think and speak clearly Loss of ability to perform everyday tasks Changes in behavior Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, there are prescript ion medications and other treatments that can help slow the progression of symptoms, improve ability to perform everyday tasks, and help maintain independence. If you or someone you are caring for is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, you may want to talk with the doctor about a unique Alzheimer's medication called Namenda (memantine HCl). It works in an entirely different way than all of the other Alzheimer's therapies on the market and has been shown in clinical trials to safely and effectively treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. *** Please do check out the Resources in Yellow at side for more information on this medication as well ..........LYN

When is it over?,"Hi...new member here. It's been about 4 years since my father started losing the threads, began to construct his own world. And just over the past few months there is only silence after the initial greeting. I hug, stroke and massage his hands and feet, which he seems to enjoy. But now when I make eye contact I feel that it somehow threatens him. As if he knows he's too far away and can't get back. Has anyone else had this feeling? Jaysal.","Thanks SnowyLynne It's maybe me, projecting my own emotions and fears onto him. I visit him every second day, to assist with his meals and put on his pyjamas etc, which is great practical help I know, but always inside and behind it all is this desparation to hang on to him. He was my world.


 Thanks Red. Hoping always that it does bring some comfort by being there. But also wishing he isn't aware of the need for comfort so that he isn't stressed at all. Want it both ways I know.... hate this insidious disease.


 Hi Lynnie, thanks for the welcome. I think there's a difference when it's your partner, I've seen my mother do the same thing but with more intensity, I imagine the need to connect with a partner is stronger. My ""gut"" feeling is that we are inadvertently asking them of something they aren't able to give and it threatens them and they get frustrated. What I do now is only use eye contact briefly. I guess it wasn't so bad when each day he got further away but I was able to go with him ( if that makes any sense).... now there's no place to follow. It's a minefield of emotion isn't it? You have just helped me!....reading this back to myself I got very anxious....and realise that with my brain pathways still working normally, the inability to connect is frightening, and it makes me feel inadequate.... how must it feel for someone who's pathways are becoming further apart every day?


 Dear Miriam I have loved and adored my father for 60 years, and it's only now that I can truly love him unconditionally as he did me as a child. He doesn't know ""who"" I am, but he knows I am different to the people who surround him...I wear the same perfume, use the same phrases and mannerisms, in the hope it will give him some reassurance and sense of familiarity. But all of this is guesswork, I can't know what his world looks like to him, and I suspect the reassurance is for me. It is as you say the ""long"" goodbye and sometimes the grief will ambush me when I am feeling vulnerable...but I am so grateful now that I can say goodbye, he's not been snatched away, he isn't in pain and he isn't concerned with the stress and anxiety of daily life. Most of what distresses me is my need to explain to him what's happening, to ask if he is okay, to let him know he will never be alone, always be cared for. And I recognise it's my needs not being fulfilled that hurts so much. He most certainly isn't the man I knew, but with the barriers down, the reserve gone, his essence is something exquisite. And finally I can love him in a way I never dreamt was possible. But I still want him back!


 Red My father went through this stage of being the frightened child and like you it was gut wrenching to leave him. So much guilt and hopeless despair in not being able to help them. When I look back this was the hardest time of all. Like a mantra I kept repeating to myself soon, soon this stage will be over and thankfully now it is and he's in a place where nothing seems to bother him. But there are other people where he lives, whom I have known for a few years now and they seem to be locked into this frightened child stage, so confused and troubled. I used to go every day but now every second day so I have spent quite some time with the other people there, and from what I have observed they do forget the distress quite quickly. Everyone is so different though, as are the effects of this disease....all that is common is how much it hurts the families. I think of it as a trade off, how much it hurts is equal to how loved and wonderful they were. What I find very touching though is the extreme patience and gentleness they show to one another, even though seemingly they aren't communicating any sense as we know it. And I wish we could be as generous with our time and care as these new personalities are.


 It happens you just keep loving them stroking or whatever.If he feels threatened when you look him in the eyes don't do it...........


 It is always so hard to see someone we love decline in mental health. Even though he may not be able to express himself, I bet he is relieved to know you are there with him. It's the little things that mean so much.


 hi jaysal.... i'm not sure if it's my place to welcome you in around here, but welcome...... i'm going through basically the same thing with my partner right now, she seems further away everyday.....we've been together 20 years... jaysal, i think you described something that i couldn't.....she seems to want to get aggressive and skidish of me when i look directly into her eyes for a response....i had not been able to link the 2 until i saw your post, so thank you very much.... i hope i will be able to help you if i can in any way lynnie


 It is called ""the long good-bye"" SO aptly worded. My mom was diagnosed over five years ago and continues to decline mentally. The doctor says she's doing well. Yes physically. Mentally? She doesn't know who I am when I go to visit her. During the course of the day, she will remember. Seems that voices can trigger some memories. There are times I don't know who this person is. Her personality has changed so much. She has become so childlike. My best resource has been the book called ""The 36 Hour Day"". You can purchase it on line or in book store and it is very inexpensive. Then again, I've read and read for the past five years and it still doesn't prepare me for what she is becoming, or who she is losing. I wish all of you well, Miriam


 I understand your grief. I too grieve for the woman who was. My grandmother (and grandfather) was always a big part of my life. My mother (her daughter) died when I was 10 and she was always there for me. She did not live in the same state as me but she was but a phone call away. Then when I got older, we would go visit her and gpa. After gpa died, she moved in with us and lived with us for 4 almost 5 years. I was her primary caregiver after her mind started going. I seen the woman I love decline rapidly both physically and mentally. She is in an assisted living home now and I still go see her twice a week. But everytime I go, I don't know what I am in for. She has never forgot who I am and she clings to me like a frightened child. It tears me up inside when I leave her. Somedays she will call me up and babble nonsense and it's usually fear filled. I am usually able to calm her down but it still is hard on me. I absolutely HATE this disease! But what I found that comforts me is remembering the way she was and I feel extremely grateful to have known her before her mental decline. I look back on those memories with fondness. Hang in there, we all know what it's like to see the one we love diminish."

A Song For My Grandma,"My Grandma died in 2007 from Alzheimer's. We kept her home with us instead of putting her in a nursing home. We are lucky enough to have a large family so there was always someone here to take care of her. It was, and still is, extremely hard. We miss her so much. Watching her just drift away from us was one of the hardest things that we have ever dealt with. During her last days, we had hospice come to our house. They kept her comfortable but it certainly didn't make it any easier for us, though they did try. My husband was so overcome with emotion at the end, that this song just came to him on his way into work. He called it ""Family Glue"". We have decided to sell the song and donate 50% of the profits to the Alzheimer's Association. I know that you will all be able to relate to it, it is completely amazing. It has been 2 years and the song still brings me to tears, but it also helps me. I hope that his song will do the same for some of you. You can hear a sample of it and purchase it on our website ** . On August 11th it will be released on iTunes, Amazon, Rhapsody, Napster and eMusic. I will also put a copy of the Press Release that we have sent out. I just want to say everyone out there is in my prayers, I understand what you are going through. ~In Loving Memory Of Our Grandma, Anita ~ Thank you for reading this, Elisa I'm sorry to hear of the loss of your grandmother. It is never easy to lose someone we love. I had to remove all your links and last names. As noble as your cause is, this is still in violation of several forum rules.

"Sounds farfetched, but wouldn't hurt to try",Doctor says an oil lessened Alzheimer's effects on her husband http://www.tampabay.com/news/aging/article879333.ece,"I read about this in energy times and received the full article. She may be on to something but I don't think I could make my mom drink the amount of coconut oil she suggested.


 ......They are pricey ...I would suggest really looking deep into this before spending the money I am up on most things that come out for AD but to me I dont know about this I have to do more reseach into it Yes Omega's are good for the brain IMHO........... THanks for posting info LYN


 I use the coconut oil for my mom. I measure 1 tablespoon of cocoa and add some honey to taste and then add 3 t ablespoons of the coconut oil. Mix together and spoon into the bottom of egg carton and put in refrigerator to get cold. It will harden up and you can give it to your loved one like candy 3 times a day. That will give you 3 tablespoons a day. Hope this helps someone who wants to try the coconut oil.


 .....It does sound out there but who knows right???


 Coconut Oil? isn't that one of the Bad fats, colesterol wise. If not whip it up in the blender with some pineapple juice. Tell her it's a pina colada. i have heard that the Omega 3,6,9,s are good for the brain, but pricey.


 I pay $13.75 for 32 oz of MCT Oil, the supposed active ingredient i coconut oil. MCT oil remains liquid at room temperature, unlike coconut oil. I add a dash to my hot cocoa."
Advice or meddling?,"I need some advice. My Father-in-law has late, stage one Alzheimers, my mother-in-law is going to pass away in few weeks from cancer. My Husband wants to find in home care for his dad when she's gone. I think it isn't realistic and am encouraging him to live with his dad for a week to get a good understanding of what he's capable of alone . Do I let my husband and father-in-law both struggle with possible harmful consequences or start looking for a facility?","Thank you for responding. You are the only one and I appreciate the input.


 Thank you for all your suggestions. When my mother-in law passes, I guess we will have to just make up our day to day routine as we go and be grateful he is with us. Right now I am sad and tired of waiting for this new stage in our life to begin. The unknown is scarey to us and I am always too proactive and organized. This libo is frustrating but I will start to 'baby proof' our home. My husband is currently looking for someone to live in his father's home and that opens a whole mess of worries in regards to trust issues! Your kind thoughts are appreciated.


 Most with Alzheimers need a structured day every day.Routine is needed it helps them....This won't be about you but about him..........


 Let him try it & see what conspires......It may be ok.......He will need some help at times from you though........


 My sister and I took care of our grandmother who suffered from late stage Alzheimer's for several years. We also both worked full time jobs, have families, etc. It isn't always easy but you also have to think of how your husband will feel if he doesn't at least try. It's almost like he's losing both parents at the same time. You have my deepest sympathies. There are day care programs that can be very helpful. We also used to give my Grandma ""jobs"" to do that really couldn't go wrong but made her feel useful again. We'd have her sweep the deck that was fenced in and things like that. You'd need to prepare your house almost like you'd baby proof it. For example, My Grandma loved to cook. We'd let her cook if she would ""teach us how"" and we could supervise her. Otherwise, we locked up the knobs from the stove. She loved to sew so we kept her supplied with her machine, needles and thread. Then we gave her garments we ""really needed her help repairing"" that in fact we later used as rags. If we couldn't supervise, the things went away because we needed her help doing something else. She never knew a thing and it really made her feel useful and important for us to ask for her help. You could try doing some things like that adapted for your father-in-law of course. If he did household repair, you could give him something from freecycle to ""fix"" if you don't have anything suitable. If he gardened, you could need his help pulling weeds from an unused part of the yard. Maybe washing the car? He may well have some important lucid moments while doing such activities your husband and you will treasure. I don't know if this will help you or not but it worked for us. It's also really important to remember that people get angry and it's ok. Arguments will occasionally happen with adults living together even under the best of circumstances. Something you like might get damaged but things like this are small in the grand scheme of things. Hope this helps. Good luck in whatever you do.


 I would seem that by staying with the Father in Law for a week would be an execellent time to observe just what abilities are, such as can they handle actually taking their own bath or are they muddling through bathtime and it is so so, Do they remember what day it is or do they have to keep looking on a calander someone marks for them. If you ask them a question do they get irrate because they cant remember the answer? Such as ""What did you have for lunch today?"" and they get irritated and say leftovers, etc... because they don't remember what they had. (I have this client, she don't get to upset, but she'll say the first thing to come to her mind a food, any food, just to answer your question, even though you personally know you made roast. I let my client find the salt and pepper for me when I'm cooking, she will offer to find the cooking pot because she still knows where that is. and she puts the butter etc back in the fridge when I'm finished with it. It is really great, and she loves to be in the kitchen being productive. And she gets to be at home for the time being. I am only there 3 days a week, but I give the family a break during those days. Well, hope everything turns out the way you want. Sherrvonne."
This is frightening - protect your loved ones,"Apparently two reporters from the National Enquirer recently signed Brooke Shields' mother, who has dementia, out of her residential facility and took her off premises. http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/celebs/c109044_brooke_shields.html This started me wondering: should facilities not maintain a list of approved visitors/people allowed to sign the person out, just as day cares do for young children? Or perhaps they do, and I just am not aware of it. If I had a parent in this situation, I'd be in the administrator's office today finding out how they would prevent this from happening.","The facilities in my area do have lists of ""approved"" people who can sign out their resident patients. They are very aware of the legalities involved with visits and excursions. I think the personnel in the facility in the Shields' case should be disciplined at the least or fired. This is a 'heads up' for everyone. Too bad it comes after the fact but TG her mother was not harmed. (And, of course, 'harmed' is a relative term.)


 At the assisted living facility where my Gma is at, they do have a list of approved visitors. And in fact, if they don't know a person who is visiting someone there, they will call the relatives to ask permission. The doors are security locked so only the immediate family have the codes. But that sure is scary! Some people don't have any respect or ethics!


 That is scary! Good to post here as a reminder to everyone! We took our Grandma in and used a daycare facility to help us out. I was too afraid of her treatment in a home and we really wanted her w/ us. A friend was an administrator there or I'm not sure I would have trusted them either. It was tough to do working full time and w/ the family but it was very worth it for us. It showed me what great friends I have too. Everyplace we were invited my Grandma was welcomed. No matter what she said or did, she was treated w/ respect. People at my job even volunteered to stay w/ my Grandma so we'd have trusted caretakers for her and could get some time off w/out worry."
Help with losing a pet,"Hi, i'm new to the site. My mother has Alzheimer's and my Dad is her caretaker. I make sure I go over every week to help give my dad help with my mom. the reason i am here is to see what we can do mom, she has a dog (Dolly)that is 14 years old. Sunday Dolly was not looking to well,at 8:00 pm mom wanted to take Dolly to the Vet. This is tuesday ans dolly's doctor said there is nothing else can be done, Dolly needs to be put to sleep. Mom doesnt want to go live without dolly. Dad is about to go crazy. What can we do to make her stop talking about dying?","I saw your post and hope you don't mind me posting my views.. Do you have pictures of Dolly? if not then take a few of her now.. second, losing a pet can be as hard as losing a person so just understand that whatever happens it's going to be hard. I lost Maximillion my cat of 17 years last January and it was so hard to have him put down. Talk to your mom and tell her every chance you can that Dolly's time here is limited and that she's not well or happy anymore and should be put to sleep to ease her pain. that'll be the hard part is explain it to your mom simply by letting her know that Dolly is in great amount of pain and that the humane thing is to put her to sleep, and that you've had 14 good years with Dolly and that you have pictures to look at and maybe frame some pictures.. Good Luck to you as this will be a hard time for you you have my sympathies in the up and coming loss of your pet... ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((HUGZ)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))


 Thank you all for your support and views. we had to take mom in to the see her doctor so she can handle losing Dolly. They made her talk to 3 shrinks because she told the doctor about not wanting to live. they also gave her something to make her calmer. After the doctors we went to see Dolly at the vet, Dad took lots of picture of them together and mom was ok with letting them put Dolly to sleep. ( Rest-N-Peace Dolly) Next week mom as apointment to see the shrink. thanks again,


 When I was sick the thing that made me feel the best were dogs. I loved them. And they were easy friends for me. The did not know I was sick and they always loved me. I ended up with a total of 5 dogs. When I lost my favorite dog in dec. I thought I was going to die. I even had him with me during my treatment for my alztheimiers at enivta. I would come go to pet smart or a shelter and tell them that you are looking for a older dog....not a puppy right now, too much work. And see if you can find a nice old dog that someone lost or did not want. The older dog will be most grateful. Be sure to get a nice dog. No pit bulls mix's or anything. Then bring it home to your mom. If she has a big heart and I am sure she does....tell her something like....you wer driving down the road and look what you found. And what should you do with the dog. Then let it feel like it is her idea to be saving the dog. Instead of it being put on her. Sounds sort of silly. But it will give her a great sense of worth to save another. She will still get very depressed when she loses' her main dog. If her main dog is a male, then be sure to get another dog of the same gender. I tend to like male dogs better. My baby bull dog then became my ""baby"" after losing my favorite toto. Song birds are nice too. Like a male canary who sings their heart out everytime I enter a room. These little things give so much joy and sort of a distraction, if you will, to our own self.


 Bring another dog home & see how she does..........Or a kitten..........


 I'm not sure how gone your mother is with her Az but I like the idea of getting her another dog, maybe one that looks like Dolly. You can always say, if you find a dog like Dolly, that it was a mistake and you brought Dolly home. Sometimes we have to do these little tricks to keep them happy. We all know that losing a beloved pet is horrible and they're irreplacable but people with Az have a different way of looking at things. They tend to stick with the same emotional and physical patterns. So when something happens and it puts a wrench into that patterns, it can aggravate, aggitate, or make them beligerant or depressed.


 Post back when you can, and I hope your mother is still doing well and I'm glaad you had photo made...and when your sure she might be up to it maybe think about getting another pet as pets can be the best of therapy (hint if your not allergic to cats a cat can be a good pet and they usually live longer than dogs, but it depends on the breed, pure breeds have shorter lives it seems.......... Anyways I wish you well in what you decide to do... well wishes to you........


 Oh..also buy her a pretty plant....or more. I like Orchids because you cannot kill them. And the blooms last for 3 mos. You can get them at Home depot. And that can be something beautiful that she can look at and enjoy and she can care of it easily. It will make her happy. What women does not like flowers?"

Question for Snowylyn,Hi Lyn - You were diagnosed 8 years ago - that sure does give me hope You are on generic Razadyne - how much do you take What other secrets can you share ........,"What kind of test did they perform to find out it was vascular dementia?


 If you will ask specific questions I might be able to answer you.I just can't think of anything off hand,LOL.......


 Good Morning SnowyLyn, My husband had a PET scan done and is neurologist just blurted out Alzheimer's - no explanation, very nonchalant like oh yeah AD life goes on - he has also had a spinal tap and we are waiting for the results of the tau protein - how sure do you think he can be that it is definetly AD and not some other form of Dementia - do all forms of dementia turn out the same - with the same problems and outcome or can you live for a long time - maybe just a little confused - HopeFloats Also what type of tests did the psychologist do?


 Sorry bout the LYN, Lynne I am positive and so is my husband - we are still waiting to get the spinal tap results back - his philosophy is let's not worry until we have to - he is busy doing things around our house - he has a great attitude - thanks for all of your input...


 I was actually dx at age 57 in 1998.When I was 65 I decided I was doing too well so told my Neuro how I felt & he agreed I needed further testing.It came out Vascular Dementia.I had been on 24mg(theraputic dose) of Galentimine(generic Razadyne).I am now on 16mg a day. Ask anything you want of me.If I can I will answer you........


 I was sent to a shrink & he had all types of different tests for me.A royal pain,lol......I have some ADHD too added to the mix...It's not bad I just fail to pay attention as I should....


 If you don't ask you won't know.


 All dementias are different yet the same.I have Vascular Dementia.It's different in each person as no 2 are alike at the same time. I did math,spelling,pictures,writing.I don't know what all the diff.tests indicated,but I was told not to think about having AD.ADHD is also in the mix but I rarely think about the negative I keep positive as much as I can. Stress is bad for anyone with dementia,don't argue,don't push to make us remember things as we can't.Redirect as much as you can.BTW I'm LYNNE not LYN.

 I don't think anyone can tell you how long each stage will last. Some people who get AZ have it progress rapidly and in others it can take a while. The medication that your husband is on is meant to slow down the progression but there is no cure - unfortunately :( But I want you to keep this phrase in your head for the future: Your husband is STILL in there. This has helped me tremendously when my grandmother came down with AZ. She is an assisted living center right now but she used to live with me for 4 years. I was taking care of her and as she declined I had to keep telling myself that she is still in there. Definately come back and post as often as you like with questions or concerns. I know this forum helped me immensely with my grandma.


 Dear Hope Floats: I can't give you answers either, I can only share a little of my experience. Both my Paternal Grandmother, and her son, my Father, were/are afflicted with Alz. Both began to show signs quite early, like around age 50 -55. I first noticed my gramma when I was in my twenties, she would talk about the ""little people who came at night and moved everything around, so she couldn't find stuff'. I tried to pin her down on it, did she mean the grandchildren, ""heavens, no"" says she, these are evil little folk who come when I'm asleep, the grandchildren, are always asleep then, too"". what it was, of course, was she was burrying things, hiding things in odd places like flour in bathroom hamper, that sort of thing. She was always kind and pleasant, except she reserved her anger for the little folk. Her husband lived to be 94, and took care of her right till about six months before he died, when we got services in for her. She lived another two years dying at 92. At the final stage, the worst of her symptoms were quite playful. She would wait till someone wasn't looking and steal food off of their plates. Keeps xmas and Thanksgiving interesting. My Dad, he began letting my stepmother take over everything at around age 55. He began to tell the same stories over and over again. He began misplacing things. The biggest problem was, he was phobic of doctors and it was hard to pin down what was really going on. He continued to deteriorate, at an uneven pace, like he'd become more and more forgetful, then he'd have times when he seemed very much his old self. He is currently in a fairly modern facility which allows dementia patients free range of the facility, my choice, big time. I took care of him myself the last 2.5 years before placement, placement was by the Police and local Adult protection agency, b/c he was becoming combative and after three police involvements, they put him in for 72 hours observation, and was then transferred directly to a facility. I had imput into which facility, I was given several choices. Come to find out this past February, he has a golf ball sized tumour sitting in his head putting pressure on his amyglia. Ergo, the acting out, intimidating, aggressive behavior. Because he feared doctors so much, he refused the Cat scan ordered two years prior, otherwise they might have caught it earlier. I don't think that would preclude the alz. however, he would still have dementia, regardless of the tumour. My Dad is happy where he is. There are lots of men in that facility, and he is very popular b/c he is really hilarious, always was, and they all follow him around waiting for what will come out of his mouth next. He is in the best possible situation. i can get to him in twenty-five minutes and tend to all his needs, pay his bills, etc. It is a difficult but rewarding journey, many run away from it. I don't recommend that course of action. Come here, get all the supports you can, cry alot, beg a lot, be firm with authorities, you are his advocate. They are making great progress with managing alz. the only thing to fear is fear itself.


 Is it a bit scarey when docs say, it works, but we don't know how or why it works. This is pretty flimsy science. My Dad seemed to do well on Aricept but was changed to Reminyl, after he threatened to drive a bulldozer through the doctors office. Probably no correlation. I found the Reminyl (just my observation) caused him more agitation, however the unknown brain tumour was in play simultaneously.


 Awfully glad to hear that SnoweyLynne. I don't really know, with my Dad how much erratic behavior is attributable to the disease process and what's caused by the tumour. That really took me blindsided. I was dealing with him in one way as having alzheimer's and then to hear ""Brain Tumour, size of golf ball, been there for some time, inoperable."" It oddly; isn't a sad thing as he is happier, now, than I ever remember except as very small children when he put together amazing Christmas's for us, full out, hundreds of lights, a room full of presents, until my mother became so sick, mentally ill. Then everything went away. Well, I guess we all have good and not so good memories. My dad will be trumpetted out of this life in Grand Style, you watch me, now.


 I wish I knew so much more about Alzheimer's disease to help others and to help me learn more about both my elderly parents who have it. It is so sad to see a parent get old and turn into someone they're not. They make things up, insist on doing things they can no longer do, and as it progresses it's even worse. Of course, I am sure this disease is the worst for older people. My mom is 86 and my dad is 91. They can't communicate well anymore, or hear each other, or know when to get out of each other's way while using their walkers. My mom is starting to get lost using her walker. Thankfully, they live in an AL and have a great aide.


 Thanks Lyn, I do not see the posts - can you help me Do you have any idea on stages and how long they can last??? Thank you again - our family appreciates it, especially me......

When and how to take away the car keys,"When and how to take away the car keys Overall, many older adults are capable of driving safely, even into their seventies and eighties. But people age differently. Several factors place seniors at much greater risk for road accidents. More important, a person 70 or older who is involved in a car accident is more likely to be seriously hurt, more likely to require hospitalization and much more likely to die than a young person involved in the same crash. Knowing the risk factors and warning signs of an older loved one who has become unable to safely operate a vehicle will help you gauge when it’s time to take away the keys. There are also strategies to help you talk to seniors sensitively about giving up driving and present them with practical transportation alternatives. Changes that come with age can adversely affect driving ability. These include: * Visual decline—including poor depth perception, narrowed peripheral vision, poor judgment of speed and poor night vision, along with increased sensitivity to bright sunlight, headlights and glare. * Hearing loss—especially the ability to hear important warning sounds while driving. * Limited mobility and decreased flexibility—which increases response time slows pedal selection and steering control, and limits the ability to turn one’s head to look for hazards. * Chronic conditions—such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, sleep apnea, heart disease or diabetes can impair driving skills, even suddenly. * Medications—as older people often take more medications, which, in combination or taken with alcohol, can result in risky unpredictable and dangerous side-effects * and drug interactions. * Drowsiness—is often due to medication side-effects or sleep difficulties that come with age, resulting in daytime tiredness and an increased tendency to doze off during the day (or while driving). * Dementia or brain impairment—makes driving more dangerous and more frustrating. It can also cause delayed reactions and confusion on the road. When it’s time to hang up the keys: Talking to a relative about his or her need to stop driving is one of the most difficult discussions you may ever face. However, it’s better if it comes in the form of advice from you or someone he or she knows rather than by an order from a judge or the DMV. One of the main reasons seniors are reluctant to give up driving is that it is one of the few ways they can continue to feel self-sufficient. The discussion becomes even more difficult when the person still maintains most of his or her faculties, just not those that enable safe driving. How to approach “The Talk:"" It helps to have a thoughtful, caring plan in place before saying anything, says Harriet Vines, author of “Age Smart: How to Age Well, Stay Fit and Be Happy.” She suggests: * Be empathetic. “Imagine how you would feel if you were in your parent’s place,” Vines says. Ask others to join in the meeting. It helps to involve other family members in the discussion—to help, but not to confront. * Keep the conversation non-accusatory, honest and between “adults,” not “child and parent.” Say things like, “We’re concerned,” “We care” or “We don’t want you to get hurt or to hurt others.” Once you’ve both come to an agreement, you can continue to support your loved one in ways beyond just offering rides. * Encourage the senior to use positive language to describe their situation to others and help them gain comfort in asking for assistance. * Help the senior make a schedule. He or she can plan activities and combine trips on oneday when a caregiver can drive them.","You take the keys away from a loved one who cannot drive. If there is a chance that they could hurt themselfs or worse yet....another person in the street. It is your moral obigation to take the keys away. But first I would start with the alternative ways to get about . And if you want to keep yourself from being the focus of alot of misery over being the one to take the keys away. Lie....do something under the hood of the car so that it will not start at all. So it will not be your fault. Then stall for some time. Have the car taken to a mechanic etc. Taken away. And then day by day....stall. Say how much it is going to cost...etc...no parts...etc... Till you can figure out what to do.


 The thing that worried me the most about losing my keys...it was not the car. But my independence. How was I going to buy food. How was I going to get things done? I think that these are the things that need to be addressed. In a positive note. Alternative transportaion. Teaching them another way to get around. Or living in a place that makes that easier. To be able to still have a life of sorts and not be stuck at home.


 I would just add that while it's good to have a few family members present to discuss taking the keys; it shouldn't be a group confronting an individual. It's embarassing to the individual to have a group present when they're told they no longer function like the competent adult we all want to be. I'd also present the alternatives at the same time...like how frequent the bus comes, the friends they can meet if they go on the group outings w/ your local senior center, etc. Biking and health reasons can even be an option to mention depending on their situation. There are some very sturdy trikes for adults that are becoming more and more popular. Hope it helps."
Common Themes for Those DX With Alzheimer's Disease,"Common Themes Among People Diagnosed With Alzheimer’s Disease 1. Denial. Too many people believe that people with Alzheimer’s Disease are not capable of understanding the disease. However, Snyder has found that some may go through periods of denial because of the difficulty in accepting the disease. Bill, a person diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease said, ""I’m interested in this idea of denial. I think denial is helpful sometimes. You don’t want to carry this all the time. Denial can be very adaptive. It’s a psychological defense; we all use it and it can give us time to accommodate to a circumstance that may be very challenging."" It is understandable that there is denial in some cases because of the unpleasant stigmas associated with the disease. James, another patient said, ""A degree of denial is essential; like somebody drinking hot coffee, we sip the truth of our condition gently."" There may also be denial due to the fear that the person with the disease may become prematurely dependent. Or they may simply forget that they have the disease. Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease need understanding if they fluctuate between acceptance and denial. 2. Ambivalence in Disclosing Diagnosis. Because there is not widespread understanding of Alzheimer’s Disease, there are often misconceptions about the disease. Some with the disease fear that others will think the disease is contagious. Those diagnosed may also fear the stigma associated with the disease; therefore, they may not disclose it to their friends or family. Betty, a person with Alzheimer’s Disease, said, ""when it comes to Alzheimer’s, you’re not sure how people will respond to you, people may brush you away because they're afraid of the disease."" Snyder believes the ambivalence begins in the doctor’s office. She contends that when doctors do not appropriately disclose the Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis to family members, that they are beginning the cycle of ambivalence. 3. Wanting Things to Stay the Same. There are often times when the feeling of: ""If things could just stay as they are at one point in time,"" that those with Alzheimer’s Disease could learn to adjust to the disease. Harry said, ""If only it could stay just as it is now; it would be great."" Unfortunately, with this disease, it is always changing. Each day is different. One day the person with Alzheimer’s Disease may be able to do something and the next day they may not. 4. Fear of the Future. Among Alzheimer’s Disease patients, there is a fear of losing a sense of self. ""What is going to happen to me?"" is often the question that arises among those with the disease. One woman said, ""I’m almost 71 and I’m not amazed that people die, so it isn’t the death; it’s the loss of oneself while you’re still alive."" There are so many tragic images that can lead to fear of losing oneself to the disease. One wife very aptly said, ""I’m very much aware that it’s a true medical disease. I realize now, at least in our case, that it appears to be a gradual process so it’s something we have to work our way into and through. So I’m finding it doesn’t mean an immediate personality change or becoming violent like I’ve heard. All this stuff you hear may happen among some people at some level but it’s gradual and you can adjust to it."" 5. Day to Day Experiences of Memory Loss. Everyday is a new experience with Alzheimer’s Disease. One person adjusting to the disease said, ""I take a step before doing something and ask, ‘Am I the same person? Can I do this?’"" There may be daily changes in language and abilities to do certain tasks such as driving or paying bills. One man, who was an editor, said, ""I’ll search for a word and I can see it walking away from me; it gets littler and littler, it comes back to me but at the wrong time; I can’t be spontaneous."" Bob described his feelings about no longer being able to drive. He said, ""losing my driver’s license was like someone cutting off my arm. I lost something that was a part of myself."" 6. Changes in Self-Esteem/Self-Concept. Everyone defines themselves by their roles in life or by their characteristics. Those with Alzheimer’s Disease may be in a state of flux about how to define themselves. For example, before Alzheimer’s Disease, a mother may have defined herself by the role she played as the matriarch in the family. A man, who defined himself by his role as a doctor, may now find that that persona is lost. One woman demonstrated her ambivalence about her identity when she said, ""sometimes I’m me and sometimes I don’t know who I am, I don’t know. It comes and it goes. You’re not really you, you’ve got someone kind of in back of you."" Those with Alzheimer’s Disease need to be reminded that they are still people who will continue to be remembered for the roles and traits that defined them as well as their new roles. In later stages of the disease, providing the person with activities that reflect their previous expertise and interests enhances their peace of mind and autonomy. PLEASE Respect and give them all the DIGNITY they so deserve",TTT for newer members
Stomach Flu when you have Dementia,"My Gma had an accident in her bedroom. She tried cleaning it up herself but ended up making a bigger mess before she told me. She left a strip of stool/diarhea about 6 foot long on her carpeted floor. She felt so horrible about it that I didn't get angry with her because obviosly she couldn't control it. But the stench was so awful!! And another time, she was prepping for a colonoscopy and she tried running to the bathroom. Diarrhea was running down her leg and onto the carpet in the livingroom before she made it to the bathroom where she had no control and it exploded into the hallway and in the bathroom. I had to clean it up and my husband cleaned the towels - but he ended up throwing up because of the smell. I think that as they get older, they don't view bodily habits like a regular person. My gma will start talking about her bowel and urine habits while we are in public such as a restaurant (until I shush her a bit lol)! My gma uses Depends underwear but I found that it doesn't do a very well job of keeping stool in - urine yes but not stool. But Depends have various types of diapers that may work better. Also too, they make adult size rubber pants that may help keep the mess in. Use a Depends with rubber pants and that might work.","Also went thru the accidents with parents and I have had my own with the crohns I wear depends ( pads) Mom and Dad I put them on the Depends Diapers... as well as got them covers for the beds......... They cannot help it and they are so sad to have to see go thru this arent they ' Hard on the loved ones too .......... LYN

 People with AZ and who take sleep aids, well it can work either way. When my grandmother fell and broke her arm, she was on vicodin which in turn caused massive episodes of dementia. I called her family doctor because she was waking up at all hours of the night, not getting any rest nor were we because we had to help her back in bed because of her broken arm. He recommended we try an otc sleep aid. I stopped her vicodin and just gave her Tylonel. The first night she took the sleep aid, it did the complete opposite. It made her more awake and more jittery. She would not sleep at all while on a sleep aid. I asked her doc about this and he said that the chemical balance in her brain is messed up which is why she had the opposite effect with the sleep aid. So I just wanted to warn you that Ambien, which is notoriously known for causing sleep walking, driving or doing strange things to a person with an amnesia affect, may do the opposite to your mother. Meaning that if Ambien can do this to a healthy normal individual, it can make matters worse for your mother.


 Tylonel is perfectly safe unless taken in high doses and for long periods. Also too if a person has liver issues to begin with then it is not that safe. As for the sleep aid, I'm not really sure. This is something you will have to ask her doctor. I know their brain chemicals aren't typical so they may or may not respond as a normal healthy person would.


 I gave my mom the whole tablet of Ambien last night and made her sleep in depends just in case she pees while she's fully asleep. She slept for about 6 hours straight and snored like crazy but also was mumbling in her sleep. Since she starts sleeping before 9 she was awake at 3 which didn't help me much since I don't go to bed until 10 to 10:30. There were urine stains in her diaper so she did pee in it while she was sleeping. I think it will be pretty expensive to make her wear one nightly if I'm to have take Ambien nightly.


 Update on Ambien. My mom isn't exactly sleeping through the night but she is snoring which means she's in a deep sleep with it. She still gets up to pee throughout the night even after she's taken Ambien. I took her to get an MRI 3 weeks ago. She wouldn't stay still because the loud noise was bothering her. I ended up holding her hand and rubbing her leg the whole time. I was wondering if I was getting the MRI too. When the got her out of the tunnel she was crying and her face was beet red. Afterwards she was smiling and laughing like a kid when we got to leave the place. Today she had her teeth cleaned at the dentist. She refused to open her mouth wide enough for the x-rays to be taken so now she has to live with the 2 cavities in her mouth because without the x-rays the dental office has no proof to bill Medicare. What can I do? The dentist and assistant were quite annoyed with her for fidgeting so much during the cleaning. I wish doctors of all fields would take classes in having some patience and sympathy instead of acting like we're wasting their money making time.


 She was at the same dental office over a year ago. At that time it was an older dentist who kept chit chatting with the young pretty dental assistant which made my mom really nervous from all the excess talking. I asked him to stop and he did for about a minute and then continued. I complained to the office manager and told her we need another dentist for the next time. I took my mom 3 Saturdays in a row to get her teeth cleaned and had multiple fillings done. At least then she still held still but this time she wouldn't cooperate at all. I am very worried about what's to come as she progresses.... Yesterday she took a blanket and walked around the house with it. I told her to leave it in the living room so she wouldn't dirty it. It became a tug of war with her when she wouldn't let go. I finally grabbed it from her and she accidentally scratched my face missing my eye by a fraction of an inch. I got so mad I called her the f*& b word and told her I wished she was dead. She got really scared and went to her room. I then started to cry really hard and got a flash back of my life the last 6 years and how much longer will this last. How did my youth escape me?


 I didn't mean to make myself sound like a mom abuser. Good thing about dementia is that she forgets quickly. I am the only person who takes her to all her doctor appointments. They are all aware of my situation and know it's a tough call but it's one I have to deal with alone. My one wish in life now is to die a minute before my mom so I won't have to see her go and yet I won't have to deal with the depression that will follow me afterward. I was and am always very close with my mom. We certainly have role reversal now. I always clung to her as a child and now she's doing the same thing to me. Everything always comes back in circles huh?


 Today has been the lowest point of my caretaking duties. It all started when I came down with food poisoning Monday night. I threw up 7 times throughout the night then had the runs nonstop for 7 hours the day after. My mom sat by me pretty quietly not really knowing what was happening to me. Last night she got the runs too. She seemed pretty ok with it and just went with the flow going to the toilet when it was time. Then this morning she got up and went to my room. She started to take out a magazine I had in there and I told her to go to the bathroom to brush her teeth. She then went to the living room instead and I noticed an awful smell on her. She had watery stool running down her leg and didn't even notice or care. The stuff was all over the carpet. I practically ran her into the shower to rinse her out and tossed out her clothes. I was so neausous from the smell and having to clean it off in 3 places. I then didn't want to take any chances of her having an infection and took her to the ER. Luckily they said it was just a flubug and gave her a prescript ion for Lomitil and sent us home 2 hours later. They had her in a diaper and I'm keeping her in it tonight. Can anyone recommend a brand that's lightweight and comfortable to wear. I hope to keep her in one for the next few days. There is nothing worse that losing your bodily function or maybe there is. The person who have to clean you up. YUCK! Anyone with similar experience? Thanks.


 Yeah you definitely know what I'm talking about . At least your grandma was aware what was happening. My mom was so disoriented and walked around really carefree which made the situation so clueless. My mom once tried to poop in my sister's wastebasket in her bathroom and missed. My sister had to pick that sucker up too but at least it was in one piece and.... DRY. Most diapers are too bulky and she'll end up removing it herself. The most stressful thing about this is that she's not aware of it happening which is giving me a phobia now. It's not like a cold where you catch it and then it goes away. Pooping is a necessity of life and usually done daily.


 The sad thing is that she's not aware that she did it or will do it again so no attempt to do it at the right place is what bothers me. My mom won't wear depends. Funny but THAT she's aware of.


 I'm sorry about your condition but like you said you knew after the fact and that you were embarrassed. My mom still doesn't understand why I've been scrubbing the carpet from the mess she made. That's the difference I'm talking about . History will repeat itself because it was never learned the first time around. My mom's not an invalid so she will continue taking off the diapers because she can do it and want to. She even prefers to go without underwear. Not so cute when you're 70.


 That's why dementia is bliss for the one suffering more so than the caregiver. You being of sound mind feels shame and embarassment for your daughter's cleanup but not my mom. Don't get me wrong, of course I'm not saying she's having a ball with this disease either. She gets very jumpy and scared and doesn't know why a lot of times and I know from personal experience with an Anxiety disorder that it's not fun. This past week she's been wearing depends with the side strip that pulls off but she's been pretty good about keeping it on. She's been dry too so that's been a blessing. Being someone who likes to go light she will want to be back in her panties real soon. I just hope once she starts to poop again that she will go in the toilet and not in the diaper. That will be a whole new chapter and headache in my life.


 She's been eating her regular food for days now but now she hasn't had a bowel movement since Saturday when she had the runs. I gave her cereal this morning with Rice Dream instead of milk to get her off of dairy. I'm just afraid she's lost touch with going #2 when she gets the sensation and holds it in until she explodes again.


 The Nuerologist prescribed Bactrim for my mom's UTI. She's suppose to take it twice a day for 7 days. I started the first dose Wed night. She got up at 2 in the morning and peed right there in the hallway between our bedrooms. I stepped right into it when I got up when I heard her walking around. To be on the safe side I'm only going to have her take it at night. The last thing I need is to have her disoriented at the daycare center. On Tuesday night she peed in the trashcan in the bathroom. The liner had a hole so her pee leaked right into the carpet. It smells like chemical. So now there are 2 places with that odor. Her bowel movement has been practically non exsistent. She may go once every 4 days and they are always hard and few. I wonder if giving her rice dream in place of milk is doing it. She eats prunes and bran cereal daily as well as yogurt and plenty of fruits and vegetables. She eats very little meat. Finally her doctor prescribed Ambien which I have yet to give her. She's up at least 3 times a night and I've had less than 3 hours of sleep nightly. This doesn't ever get easier or better.


 As I recall my mother slept well with Tylenol PM but being that it is still a pain reliever and my mother has no pain I didn't feel it was right for her to keep taking it. My cousin who's an Anethesiologist said Tylenol is notorious for causing liver damage in countless people. I gave her half a 5mg of Ambien last night and she didn't sleep through the night. I'm afraid of giving her the full dose because of all the negative stuff I've heard. She's still not going #2. Honestly I prefer this to diareha. I hope the Bactrim won't do just that. Thanks for the warning about Ambien. What is a safe and useful sleep aid for dementia people?


 I wish her doctor was that informed. She keeps prescribing things that my mom shouldn't be taking. Honestly, unless a doctor is your own personal physican I don't think they really give a crap. Speaking of which... my mom still hasn't gone. I am going nuts with worry that she will be totally blocked up. I'm not sleeping and every thing she does is driving me insane. I've threatened to kick her out many times and all she does is dare me. She's constanlty turning on the faucets and letting the water run. She draws her face with lipsticks and lipgloss and toothpaste in her newly washed and coiffed hair from the hair salon. She takes all the pillow cases off and bedsheets. I challenge anyone who thinks other illneses are worse than Dementia for the caregiver.


 It's expensive to keep them in depends but you need to ask yourself, do you want to clean up the mess? :) Does she seem better after having 6 hours of sleep? Is there any way to keep her up until around 9:30 or 10 so that way you are getting the same amount of sleep as her?


 A person with dementia has a tougher time when they have any type of infection,they seem worse....... ...Thanks Snowy.............. .....Nothing Truer IMHO Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 3/28/2009 10:44:03 AM (GMT-6)


 Bella I am sorry I am not going to say anything except this I have lost both my parents to this and I am always asking WHY could I not have had ONE more day........ You have to be able to take the place of the parent in this DD and some ppl can just not do it Plz look for help This is not the way she should be treated She has a dememtia..........she has to be afraid......... Plz see a neuro with her maybe that would be better and get some Community Care in there before things could get out of hand LYN


 I cannot comment on this as I got a bit upset with your post and I dont want to say anything out of line at this time 'I will post tomorrow LYN"
Should I bring Mum home for Christmas?,"Hi Everyone, this is my first time posting on here, though I've read quite a few of your posts and found them very helpful and interesting. My 92 year old Mum is in an assessment hospital and will go into a Nursing Home sometime in the new year. She has gone down hill very quickly lately and I have issues about the medication she has been prescribed as she was on no medication for AD when she lived at home a few weeks ago, and is now on sedation and anti-psychotics. I feel sure these are making her worse but it's a terrible fight to get the psychiatrist to reduce them. Mum never dozed during the day, she was always on the go - 'working', tidying cupboards out, not that she ever threw anything away! Now Mum often dozes when I visit in the afternoon and I cannot wake her. We used to talk all the time about the family, what was in the news but now she hardly talks, and then it's only a few words at a time and usually they don't make sense. She has no emotions, I tell her family news and she has no interest, it's as if she's depressed but she's on an anti-depressant. I haven't taken my mother out of the ward in the 8 weeks she's been in, partly because it's so cold and wet outside (it is Scotland after all!) and the ward is very hot and my mother feels the cold. And no one has even suggested it. Now today I felt pressure being put on me to take Mum home to my house for Christmas dinner. I'd love to have her there - I'm 56 and never spent a Christmas away from my Mum. But would it be the best thing for her? I'll feel guilty if I don't take her, but afraid she'll be upset at the change. She appears to have no memories of anything outside the ward so won't she even be afraid of the journey and going to a strange house? And will she enjoy it? I'm sure she'll enjoy the food, but she lives in her own little world now and interacts with nothing and nobody. Will the laughter and noise of a Christmas dinner upset her? I'll be cooking and in the kitchen, someone will have to sit with her in the lounge and she now doesn't know my husband and children and she'll want to be with me. A good friend brought her Mum home last Christmas and had to take her back before the meal as she became so distressed, and this is obviously on my mind too. Any ideas? Have you gone through this? Did it work out? I'd appreciate any advice you can give. Erin","What if you were to take her out to lunch one day and see how well she does in a restaurant? If she seems to be ok there with the hustle and bustle then she may be able to make it for Christmas dinner. And even if she does do well in a restaurant and not during dinner, then that is ok too. The fact is that you tried. She may not be able to tell you how much she appreciates you but I know she would LOVE to be around you during the holidays. I was worried about my Gma and how she would handle being at my MIL's house during Thanksgiving but she did great! In fact, she told me that she had a wonderful time. Of course though, my gma isn't as bad as your mother just yet. But I believe that even if they can't express their love or gratitude, that just the fact that they are able to spend time with loved ones, comforts them just to know that they are loved.


 Welcome to HW and the forum YOU have been given great advice already from the members I too agree with RED Take her out for a trial run so to speak and see how it goes for you both Even if on AD's she can still become depressed........ It is a hard decision but again I think Red has come up with a great idea for you PLEASE do stay with us here and get the support and understanding we all have of this DD that takes our loved ones from us Also read other threads to get insight God Bless you and your Mom LYN


 ERIN When you go Friday to Doc take a total LIST of all questions you want answered.......... I truly wish you do find out all you need to know to help your mom...... God Bless you for being the great daughter you are/ I looked after both mom and dad in their homes til death ( he was here and then in hospotal I I had to finally give permission to turn off life support HE did not want that My siblings went behind my back and did this to him I was sick and I am so sorry I could not have been there to tell the docs check chart there was a DNR( do not ressucitate on it ......... Luvs God Bless .........LYN


 Hi Everyone I feel bad for not having been on here for so long and giving you an update on Christmas. I couldn't take Mum out for a run in the car because the weather was so cold and wet, and when we went to see her a few days before Christmas we were told she was in isolation as she had Norovirus. Poor thing was being sick and had diarrhoea. She wasn't well enough to come home on Christmas day but we took her presents and helped her with her dinner and we had a nice time with her. She recovered pretty well really. I saw the doctor a week before Christmas too. I asked about her medication and the doc said 'She's not on any anti-psychotics now'. I was surprised, as she still had been the last time I'd asked a nurse - and when I said 'Oh really? Since when?' the doctor looked a bit embarrassed and said 'Since yesterday....' Hmmm, a bit of a coincidence I think that the doc takes her off them after five weeks, and the day before she sees me. Doc then said she would cut out her evening sedation and leave her on one dose in the morning. I asked if that was a good thing to do at same time as removing the anti-psychotic and she said yes, no problem. I further asked if cutting out the morning dose would not be better, but she said no. I later found out she'd reduced both by half but hadn't told me, though I feel it was a better decision. I'm now going to have to move mum to a nursing home and pay for her care, as pressure is being put on me to get her out of the hospital. But she's settled and I like the staff, and Mum won't notice if the decor is better, but I've no choice. I still tell myself that if things don't go well I'll just take her home with me, I won't have her on lots of sedation again. She is far worse than in October when she went into hospital for a small fall that did no damage and they over sedated her. I'm still angry! I just try to make the best of it when I visit, but mum mainly just sits and dozes or sits in silence while I struggle to think of things to say that might interest her, and then perhaps she'll repeat a word like 'desperate' over and over again in a high pitched voice. Of course I never find out what she's desperate about . Thanks for listening! I know I go on a bit! Erin x


 Hi Erin, So often I read of the medical profession resorting to sedating Alzheimer's patients as a matter of course. Over six years ago my wife fell and suffered injuries. She walked into hospital, a month later she came out in a wheelchair. I kept insisting that they walk her daily. Each visit I found her asleep in a chair. When I attempted to walk her I got involved in a dispute with a nurse and was told they were walking her. My wife was a quiet gentle person and remained so during the Alzheimer's years. Only after I got her home did I discover they had sedated her during her stay in hospital. When I phoned them up I gave them a piece of my mind: ""You must have been bloody sleep walking her!"" The profession's approach I found failed to take into consideration the carer's frame of mind, the stress and depression they go through inhibits clear thinking. So it was in my case when I acceded to place my wife in a NH. Once again the practice was to dose her up on medication. A year of torment followed as I watched her approach death and the accepted answers to my questions went: ""That's the way they go at this stage."" The decision to take her home was a scary one, but one I knew I must take. The NH handed over a large paper bag full of different medications all of which I turned over to our local doctor, with the exception of a pain killer, I used till no longer required. When she started shaking I put it down to part and parcel of AD, but then it stopped after a number of days. It was withdrawal symptoms! From the day I took my wife home a great burden was lifted, I had to be clear thinking to take control and where a doctor was required I insisted on being involved in decisions. It was not unlike the treatment of a child with the mother being involved. Four years and eight months after I removed her from the NH I cared alone till her death. It gave me a deep insight to myself and the unnecessary suffering unknowingly inflicted on AD sufferers. I would not dream of calling myself an expert but I have been lucky to have seen the worst, and being capable of managing single handed the best years of this DD with my wife. Sorry to have gone on but I feel passionate about the way our loved ones are being treated, so many walking around in the dark. Erin I understand you anger only too well. May God give you strength in your time of need. Padraig


 Thanks for your understanding replies, it's comforting to know others have gone through what I am now. I felt soooo sad today when I visited, I think I'm grieving for the mum I had and the realisation that we'll never again to be able to have a conversation. She likes her hugs and kisses though, even if she does cover me in orange juice dribbles mixed with chocolate! But it's so frustrating and upsetting listening to her saying the same words over and over again, and looking worried and maybe in pain, and not knowing what she's trying to say. I suggest things, ask her what the problem is, but she ignores me and continues with the high-pitched moaning. And then suddenly she'll stop and use her normal, lower voice, to ask me a question. But immediately she'll go back to the moaning. Does anyone else have this going on? None of the other ladies seem to do this. I'm wondering if it's because if it's easier for her to make this high sound than to use her normal voice. I went to visit a care home today and reserved a room for Mum so she should be moving there in the next week or so. I told the manager about my concerns about the sedation and she was very understanding - and then we left her office to see a row of five old ladies all dozing in their chairs! I didn't say anything, perhaps it's for the best if they can't do anything else and life has very little quality. Thanks again for listening and replying. Erin


 Hi Lyn Thanks for keeping in touch with me, I do appreciate it. I have been meaning to come back and tell you the latest news. I'm afraid my mum passed away a week ago, Monday 23 Feb, at 6.15 in the evening. She was transferred to the nursing home on the 18 Feb and really she should not have been moved because she was not well. She was sleeping most of the time and just flickering her eyes open from time to time, and moaning a bit. The nursing home were immediately concerned about her and called her own doctor who stopped all sedation - at long last. They also weighed her and she was only 78lbs and was refusing most food and drink. Four days later the doctor was called out on the Sunday as the nurse said her heart rate was very fast and the doctor phoned me to say she had to go into hospital. I told him that she was not to be resuscitated and he said that it wasn't at that stage but that if she didn't go to hospital it would be. I argued what was the point as what would she be coming back to? But he was getting upset with me arguing against him sending her to hospital so I reluctantly agreed. Five minutes later he phoned back to say that the hospital didn't want her (!) as they'd only give her a tablet and she could have that at the home, so I was happy with that. My husband and I immediately went to the nursing home and saw the doctor as he was leaving and discussed her pain relief and he agreed to top it up if necessary. Mum was looking very ill and grey and the nurses were trying to get her to drink something. Of course I thought if she'd been in hospital they'd have put her on a drip but then that would only have prolonged things and by this time I was just hoping she wouldn't linger to long. What horrible thoughts they are, to wish your lovely mother's life away but you all know it was because I love her. Her eyes flickered open and I am sure she knew me, her head nodded a wee bit when I asked if she was ok. I went back the next day and met her own doctor who was very thorough but said it was only a matter of time as the tablet hadn't done much good and her heart rate was still very fast and she was dehydrated. A couple of hours later she'd gone, just before I made it back to see her. She went peacefully, no distress or pain, just stopped breathing. Six days short of her 93rd birthday. It's the funeral tomorrow. I've been so busy this past week it's kept my mind occupied, but when I suddenly see her nightdress, or her spectacles I am so sad. Next week I think the reality will hit me. But I try to concentrate on the positives, I had her for such a long time and I have such happy memories of a lovely lady. I have written the eulogy for the minister to read out - I began jotting down a few notes and it ended up a five minute speech! The minister asked me to put it in the first person for him to read out. I'd love to read it myself but I'd get choked, this is the next best thing. Well I'd better go to bed now. It's good to share with you, I do feel I'm on my own sometimes, everything going on around me just the same as ever, but it's not the same for me. I still have issues with the care mum received in the health care system, and I wonder if things would have been different if I'd had the confidence to bring her home, but I'll never know now. Thanks again for your support. Erin


 Wow, that's a toughy. I can't even begin to think what to do. Is there a particular nurse who works with your mom at the home, you might consult. My stepmom is in a nursing home (not alzheimers, 3 strokes and kidney failure). Getting her anywhere is a heck of an ordeal. However, there is a primary caregiver, nurse at the home that I go to for her opinion, on Stepmom's care. My Dad and I live together, I'm his caregiver, he has Alzheimers and is becoming despondent, doesn't notice his surrondings, doesn't remember his farmhouse he and I moved out of in September. Gets whereever ( my name, doesn't remember his wife, doesn't remember his other children's names, and so on) He's just really jumbled up. Doesn't seem to recognise his surrondings. Would the doctors be able to advise?


 Hi Erin01, My wife spent one year in a NH before I could no longer take the stress and hurt of watching her become worse. I can clearly recall the first day I took her out for a day. It was Christmas day, I took her to our daughter's house for a the day. I chose to make a DVD of her that day, such a very sad sight. She could not speak and could just about move one arm. Looking back I know I did the right thing and I agree with Red. After that I took her home first for a day then a weekend and finally for good. It was just in time, as I nearly lost her so many time over the following five years. I was always driven by pure natural instinct in my caring for my her. When I look back, I never cease to be amazed at how doctors and nurses perescribe drugs for every thing. Once I took control of caring on my own I stopped all medication with the exception of a laxative in her drink. So very often I looked and found the underlaying causes for problems. Like many others in the early stages I was so stressed out I was incapable of thinking clearly. Strange as it may seem I now thank God for the absence of nurturing in my upbringing, nature provides us with instinct. I was indeed privileged to have found that my wife in spite of her lack of speech and movement could communicate by touch and through the eyes. The emotions were all there. It so hurts and angers me to read people write 'there is nothing there', how painful that must be for a loved one. When children can sense conflict between parents with age that sense becomes blurred: we are all grown up children! The best thing I said to a doctor who though it was wonderful the way I chose to look after my wife on my own: ""Don't dogs look after their pups"". I feel better for getting that off my chest. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Thank you all for your wise words and advice. I'm sitting typing this with blurry vision, it's touched me just to read what you've written. I cry easily these days, and shout easily as well which I never used to do. My poor husband thank goodness is very understanding. Well I'm definitely going to try to take mum out for a wee run in the car first, hopefully starting tomorrow so I'll take her big warm coat and rug with me as it's freezing tonight. If we get on ok with that there is a small restaurant not far away I'll take her to for coffee and then all being well I'll take her for Christmas. I know you're right, even if she can't express it I'm sure she'll like the attention. It's difficult though when she's asleep so much of the time. I'm so annoyed she's sleeping away the short time I have with her, not with her of course but with the psychiatrist. BTW she's not on any AD drugs now - she was on Memantine which she's been on for a few years now but in the summer her psychiatrist said it probably wouldn't be working after all this time and we might as well stop it. No adverse affects were mentioned and I didn't ask. I was advised to reduce the dose gradually over four weeks, which meant that she was finally off them at the beginning of October, just when she fell and went into hospital. And then they said she was hallucinating (she's been doing this for a while but so what?) restless (she wanted to walk around, they wouldn't let her) and aggressive (she's deaf as well as having AD and they shout in her face and then immediately do something to her and she is taken by surprise and being sedated she was lashing out). I've been blaming her change in behaviour on sedation but now I'm wondering if the withdrawal of Memantine has anything to do with it. I read something recently on the net about a lady whose behaviour got worse when Memantine was withdrawn eg aggression, depression, and she changed back when it was restarted. However, this story was on a Merck site so not sure if I should believe it and I know Mum's doctor won't! Has anyone got any experience of this? Mum is now on two dozes of Trazodone and two of an atypical anti-psychotic, Amisulpride, which I believe is not approved by the FDA in the States. Amisulpride is supposed to have some anti-depressant effects, and Trazodone is sedative, anxiolytic and anti depressive. And it also has lots of side effects - confusion! slurred speech, drowsiness, difficulty in concentration, lethargy, and lots of others. If I were brave enough I'd take Mum home and look after her myself but I'm not good if I miss too much sleep and they tell me she gets up a few times a night. But it remains a possibility. I'll let you know how I get on with trying to take her out. I'm hoping to see the doc on Friday so will discuss it with her. It was a trusted nurse who was putting the pressure on me! Thanks again Erin


 Erin, I am so glad you are looking at ways to bring your Mom home for Christmas. What a wonderful daughter you are. My inlaws took G-ma to the nursing home and after that I don't remember anyone trying to take her home. I guess they were afraid as before she lost her memory completely she would get paranoid and belligerent. They did bring her to their house when Gpa died and she walked the house day and night looking for Frank, her husband. That choked me up as it is such a horrible disease and to watch someone who was so bright and witty, such a good person have this happen to them is heartbreaking. My MIL is crippled with arthritis and she was not able to keep Gma at home. WE all went to visit Gma in the nursing home and my MIL went everyday to feed her lunch. We took her a Christmas present which she had no idea what it was for but the bright bow lit up her face. She kept turning it over and looking at it. I know somewhere deep down it triggered a memory from days gone by. Let you Mother see the colors of Christmas if it works out. No guilt for you if it does not. A very special holiday to you. Hugs Kitt


 My heart goes out to you, Erin, as I have just recently trodden the same path. My Dad was admitted to hospital a month ago, he just became so aggressive, and I could not manage him. It got so I was sleeping with one eye open and my foot on the floor. Soooo, having been the second time, the Police had to be summonded, they accompanied us to emerg, where they held him for 72 hours, observation. The consensus amongst all doctors was, he'd have to be placed. I had spent two solid years standing firmly against institutionalization. It broke my heart. I would not bring him home, it would just add to the confusion. I go there to see him, I also get him and take him to see his wife in another home, about twice a month.


 Welcome Erin I am so sorry all this is going on Charlie is right AD ppl do not have to be medicated to the point of being unable to do anything IMHO They are still in there and they ned the power of touch and the love always.......... STAY with us LYN

AZ and medication question,My grandmother has been on Namenda for about 4 months so far. After the first week or two of being on the medication I could tell a big difference and especially with her emotional stability and somewhat with her memory. It seems lately that her memory is getting even worse and she has these manic episodes where she calls me and thinks either I or someone else is stealing her money. She will call me in tears and tell me that I never come to see her and why don't I love her anymore. I gently tell her that I come and see her twice a week and we usually have a nice time going to lunch together. This seems to calm her down. Tonight she called me again saying that someone was taking her money and she doesn't even have any money to buy bread at this place. Obviously she doesn't need money in an assisted living center. I tried to comfort her by saying that all her money is in the bank (this usually helps) but tonight she couldn't be comforted. Does this mean that the Namenda is not working as well anymore? I plan on discussing this with her doctor btw. I'm going to call him tomorrow and tell him what has been happening. But it's frustrating to see the grandmother I love become happy again only for it to be stolen from her. I just want her to be happy and it really bothered me tonight to hear her so distraught.,"No she is only on the Namenda at the moment.


 No I haven't called the doctor today. Today was my husbands birthday and we had a bunch of people over for cake and ice cream after my daughters basketball game. I plan on calling him tomorrow and leaving a message for him to call me back. Thanks Lyn and Snowy :)


 I am happy for your dad and you I lost both my parents within 2 yrs of one another to this DD Stay with us LYN


 I am so glad you got rid of that med Snowy And ya sure did BOUNCE back Say hello to Larry wil ya Hoping all is well with you both Luvs LYN


 NYK - please read the forum rules. You can not advertise your website and business here. 4. No advertising or links to advertising or ""Spam"" is permited (including signatures).


 Is she not on any other med with the Namenda? Namenda is usually given with Aricept,Exelon,or Razadyne,not alone.......


 Sorry Red in a fibro mess I was...rainy and damp weather Anyways Snowy is spot on it is given more oft than not with another med I know you would have talked to doc by now what was his/ her answers to you I am praying and hoping this will work out for her Sounds like she was doing so great Luvs LYN


 My Dad Has alzheimers and he as well did have a significant imrovement after starting Namenda, he also had all the symptoms you described, paranoid delusions and anxiety. But what this really represents is improvment, they are having the same concerns as the rest of us, financial, security and social, however they will never improve to ""normal"", and are coping with it the best they can. I look at it this way, he is atleast improved with his memories and recognize me and family again and has atleast some rational thoughts. I know it hurts to see our loved ones decline like this but I will take anything I can get and will definately continue with the Namanda as I am sure this is slowing his decline.


 I tried Namenda & it was disasterous so I threw it away.At the end of 2 monthss I was drooling like a baby........not to mention more confused ...I bvounced back......

lewy bodies & relatives,"Janice and I went to see your mother last Saturday. I have such mixed emotions. She was being fed when we arrived so she was awake. She appeared to know us and was able to carry on a limited conversation. It appears that all she can do now is lie in bed and eat. It makes me so sad. hate these ""caring"" notes (like the above) from relatives. makes me crazy! what am i supposed to do? sent her the post about lewy bodies, but my cousins still expect more. i ""almost"" like my mother without her caustic comments and emotional abuse i lived with for years. i have ms and can barely do some things for myself, no less a mostly bedridden old lady. mother's body rejects moving on its own, so she needs the care she gets at a nursing home. they used to ***** & moan about how much better care mother would get at a nursing facility near them, but everything happened during a time i could not drive (for 2 years) due to ms so i had her taken to a home near me. they are about 40 minutes from here. guess the saying about choosing your friends but not your relatives bears repeating!",Dont let what they do or say boiher you YOU have done the best I have seen what you have done I know you are a great daughter LYN
Thanks,"Thanks for the responses. We have since taken him to his general practitioner who agreed he needed to see a neurologist. So have made appt, sooner than the last one(thank goodness). I really appreciate the input. Take care. thanks, dodi",dodi I am so glad the appointment is for sooner I do hope all will be straightened out then DO take a list of concerns and issues with you PLZ Make the doc listen and answer all you have This is what I feel they need to do to help the loved ones of our seniors stricken with this DD Keep us posted and God Bless LYN
Is it nornal???,"My mother in-law says that she does not want to eat, she not hungry. Is this normal? I don't want to keep telling her to eat, because she get's upset. Please help! Thank you for your understanding.","Thank for your response. My mother in-law has Alzheimer's and diabetes. Im worried, is this part of Alz, or she is depressed becuase she wants to go back home? Right now she has does not have a place of her own, she was staying with family CT where she is from. She was staying with her sister during the week and with her niece on the weekend, but in between that, It was very hard for them to take her to appts, get med and just dealing with her was starting to take a toll on everyone. Now she is here in TX where she is with me and it rather boring, we go out shopping allot, but she rather sit in her room and stare at the tv. I take her to get crafts but she does not want to do any of them. What do I do? I need your help! Thanks so much


 Yes it is a normal part of this DD not wanting to eat as red said Maybe you could get the doc to RX her some Boost or Ensure and make her some yummy milkshakes With low sugar of course........... She may also have problems with the Diabetes from not eating making her not want to do may things or even have the energy to do them PLZ keep us posted LYN And yes what if any meds is she on


 Does your MIL have a dementia? If so then yes this is ""normal"". I think they lose the sense of hunger along with other things. Or they will take one bite out something and think they are full. My grandmother does this a lot. Is there any foods that she really enjoys? You can try making something with her, let her help if she is able. She may want to try the foods then. Is she losing weight?


 Is she on any AZ medication?"

 His web site is still up I think.Just type in his name you will find it.........."
Lewy Body Disease,"Lewy Body disease is a dementia it differs from Alzheimers in its Symptoms and findings after death What is Lewy Body Disease??? It is simuliar to Alheimer's but the SX are typically different on close examination ,with different signs found IN the brain after DEATH. The cause is still unknown. Lewy body disease has relatively recently been accepted as a separate disease in its own right. The disease gets its name because of the deposits which are found in the brain after death (named after the doctor who first wrote about them). Lewy bodies are round deposits which contain damaged nerve cells. They are probably formed as the cells try to protect themselves from attack. It is of utmost importance to diagnose the demetia as there are different medications for the differenrt Dementia's as well as symptoms and treatment plans .....Some Family Members have a difficule time believing this COULD / DOES happen to THEIR loved ones............ Symptoms The dementia associated with Lewy body disease affects: memory language..slurred speech....no talking at all ....yelling....... the ability to judge distances The abilty to do or perform everyday tasks (things they alwasy did before The a bility to Reason (can become very beligerent or introverted (argumentative)...Emotional People with this type of Dementia may often suffer from Hallucinations (They may think they see a cat or animal or even a person on a chair when there is not one Or other things they think they are seeing that are not there AS well They may suffer from falls for no apparent reason, because their ability to judge distances and make movements and actions accurately is disrupted. They may develop some Parkinson type symptoms such as slowness of movement, stiffness and tremor. In a few cases heart rate and blood pressure are affected. The abilities of the affected person often fluctuate from hour to hour, and over weeks and months. This sometimes causes carers to think that the person is 'putting on' their confusion. THEY ARE NOT PUTTING ON THEIR CONFUSION......","Thank you so very much for the informative discussion of Lewy Bodies. My mother was dx with it a while ago, and it is difficult to cope with her rapid deterioration. The nursing home she is in takes good care of her, and I am relieved by that. However, some relatives seem to blame the nursing home, me and everything but this disease. With your permission, I would like to share the information you have gathered with those who have difficulty in understanding why my mother has changed so drastically. Linda


 Linda Checking to see how you and Mom are doing LYN


 Linda It sure sounds like she is getting great care in the NH she is in' It is hard sweetie I know to have to see her like this but do remember she is IN there somewhere Keep talking to her and make some good memories I will continue to check on you from time to time Any questions plz post okay and I will do my best to answer or find the answer for you Your family also can look up the total info on Lewy body DD and they would be more educated that way IMHO Take care hun and God Bless Lyn


 Hey Lil sis Many have not heard of this but the commonality is so large now they really have to DX this properly and totally This Dementia is named after the man who found the differences of Alzheimers and other dementias like Lewy's body Loves Big sis


 Major Update!! Mom is awake and coherent for the most part. Had t/w nurses and they agreed that her medication needed to be adjusted. So mother is off the 3 psychotropic drugs she was on and is doing much better. If i recall correctly, sometimes such medications do the opposite when taken for lewy bodies. Last family meeting went well and all attending were pleased with the way mother is progressing. i also know that with lewy bodies, change can come and go. Still, a big difference from how she was even a month ago. One of the nurses said mother seems to be coming more and more awake and her usual cynical self! linda


 another family conference and good news again. mother is doing well and is taken to certain music events at the home. her appetite is good and she is much more aware now. took some magazines for her to look thru. she also wakes up when spoken to and speech is less slurred. mother is on liquids and pureed food. much relieved that she is in a place where she gets good care. checked visitor list, but i'm the only one stopping by. don't get it, but figure people from her past don't want to see her like this. thanx again for bringing up lewy bodies. hope others read your great descript ion and be aware of this other dx. linda

 Add input if you would like plz Thanks


 Linda BY all means PLEASE do print this and share with them all that is here I can also gather more info for you about this YES it can / does and WILL make our Loved ones deteriorate very quickly ........... I am so sorry about you mom hun.....this is a DD robbing us of so much my Mom passed 2 plus yrs ago from AD and Dad just in April of this year.......... EMAIL me if you would like to talk k or add me to your msn or yahoo My info is at the side under my name............God Bless.......LYN


 kind of you to check. with your helpful info, i confronted cousins about what was going on, and they (at least one of them) accepted that my mother is no longer with us. i continue to take her communion, visit with therapy parakeet (thera-keet) and talk as though she is there. rarely does she look up or wake up at all, but i continue to persevere. the nursing home is working with her doctor at modifying meds so she is comfortable but not over-drugged. they are quick to contact me if anything happens... lately it was mother's leg falling off recliner she's in and getting a cut. i appreciate their care of her. according to nurses, she could last months... even years, but never be really awake. her appetite is good, but she is very often asleep and/or withdrawn. not much more i can do. i continue to visit with communion and thera-keet but usually get no response. if she does wake up, she almost immediately falls back to sleep/unconsciousness. i share both with other residents of nursing home, especially that special bird. used to take amazon parrot, but he can bite and never sure when he will. the thera-keet is gentle and sweet and has become a favorite on pet day. linda


 Big Sis, Great info and this is a disease I have not heard of. Thanks for posting this. Lil Sis/Kitt

New & need help!!,"My dad has not officially been diagnosed, but obviously has some form of this disease. His general practitioner has put him on arisef?

He was doing pretty good, but recently started declining rapidly. He seems to be regressing back to the time when he worked. He is retired now. He is 73. He gets very agitated and paces up and down the hall with papers in his hand. My mom doesn't want to argue with him that he is not at work, it wouldn't be a problem except he gets very upset. He had a stressful job, and he starts wanting to get on the phone and call his old employees. How do you deal with a situation like that??? She has tried getting him on another subject, giving him an easy chore to do, but he is very stubborn (always was) and after she makes a suggestion he just goes right back to the same old thing.","Welcome Thanks Snowy I TOTALLY agree with Snowy on this ASAP is the key word here AD can make a person deterioate pretty quick IF left untreated PLZ keep us posted I wish you and your family all the best LYN


 THanks for your input Always appreciated LYN


 Thanks Snowy for your Input Are you on any other meds now besides the prior ones after the Namenda caused so many issues?? Say heloo to Larry Luvs LYN


 Have his Dr get him an appointment with a Neurologist ASAP!! Aricept is the spelling.I was on it for 4 yrs til it quit working,then was put on Razadyne at my request & I'm doing great.4 yrs ago I was retested & Alzheimer's diagnoses was wrong it's Vascular Dementia.Still on the medication as it does help..........


 My mom was diagnosed with Alz five years ago and put on Aricept and Namenda, she takes both of them. Thankfully, she is not difficult in the sense that she is not annoyed or agitated. She is, however, extremely needy and cannot be left alone. There was a short time that she was agitated and arguing constantly with her aide. I called the social worker and she recommended my mom go on Seroquel, the lowest dose, which we did and it worked. She mellowed out. It did not make her sleep during the day, just calm and relaxed. When the agitation stopped, we took her off of it and so far, she's ok. If you are not against giving them drugs, you might want to talk to the doc about Seroquel. Just a thought, Miriam


 I cannot take Namenda it makes me alot worse....Seroquel works ok at a low dose.......I'm not on it anymore......."

What would I do without mother :-),"Hello Everyone, Mother who is 85, has alzheimers and lives with my brother. Not too long ago, he had a set of keys made for me to their apartment. One is for the main door at the bottom of the steps. A second and third is for the dead bolt and regular lock on their apartment door. Well, today I stopped in to visit them. I was able to unlock the bottom door, but could not get the two other keys to unlock the locks on their apartment door and my brother was not home. Finally, I knocked and rang the bell. I heard mother say, ""Who is it?"" and I told her it was her daughter. She had been asleep on the couch, but she got up and went to the front door and opened it. I was at the back door. I rang the bell again and knocked and told her where I was and she came into the kitchen and unlocked the deadbolt and the regular lock and let me in. It made me wonder if maybe I need help more than mother does Wiggyann","Wiggy It will be just 3 yrs on the 20th that I lost my Mother I know how much it pains and how much it hurts There is no one as Special as you Momma Luvs LYN


 Dear Lyn, You must have gone through a lot with your mother. The way you wrote about her lets me know that she was a very warm person and that you had a very precious relationship with her. I don't think my mother and I were ever friends. She is just my mom. I love her very much, it's just that I didn't feel about her the way I do about my good friends. She has always been a very caring and giving person, and holds a very special place in my heart even though she doesn't know who I am sometimes. I'm happy that you and your mother were friends as well as mother and daughter. I will never know what that is like. I hope one day your pain will heal, Lyn and you will have peace and beautiful memories when you think of your mother. And know that all of the love she gave to you... will always live on in you. Bless You, Dear One Wiggyann

Aunt moved to assisted living facility and safe,"Hey Everyone here I am again My Aunt is 70 years old and was diagnosed with Alzheimer in Jan 2008 As you all know this disease can progress slow or very fast and you never know what the day will bring with the different moods they get. Her disease has progressed quicker than I thought I finally Decided along with my Aunt's Doctor that she was unable to care for herself by herself and because she did not want to live with anyone and Because I work there was no one to care for her while I work I found her an Assisted Living Facility which is clean, bright the staff and other tenants are very nice, Nurses and Dr's are great and everyone is very attentive the place is Beautiful she fought me not wanting to go because she is unable to do her own cooking in the facility. and when we first went to see the place she loved it she has her own 1 room apartment but is assisted with cleaning, washing her clothes, Facility cooks her 3 meals per day as she can no longer cook for herself, Meds and she wears a medical monitor should she get hurt and need assistance there is a guard and nurse at the facility 24 hrs a day. I am soo Happy that I was able to get her into here because she can no longer do things she used to do such as pay her bills on her own forgot to pay them on time, cook she left stove on she was even getting to the point where she forgot to bathe and change her clothes daily and she was very aggresive because most importantly she kept forgetting to take her meds so that made everything worst. My Aunt still gets aggressive and every day is a struggle but Im glad she is safe. I hope and pray that she can maintain for a long while so that she can still enjoy somewhat of life. This whole experience thus far has been emotinally, Physically and mentally exhausting because I remember the Woman my Aunt once was and for me it is very difficult seeing her lose herself and see tha pain and suffering she goes through as she does not want to lose her independence or herself its heartbreaking and she is very scared a lot of the time because she doesn't want to let go or forget anything. And I also thank God everyDay for giving me the Fortitude and Strength each day as being a CareTaker is a hard Job But I Love her Like my Mom and I will be with her till the end no matter what. I just wanted to share some good as we always share the bad times. Thanks for listening. GodBless, PR Glo","Good Morning, I think you both made very wise choices. We have an Alzheimer's unit in our Assited Living/Nursing Home complex. It is a wonderful area and some of the rooms are 2 room apartments so a spouse may live with their husband or wife. They have constant supervision and it was built to be like a home. They have a kitchen and living room area. They have memory boxes on the walls and the residents can walk around and stop and look at the boxes. I wish there were more of these faciilties for people with this disease. We have a chapel where services are held everyday. I guess our town is fortunate to have such a special facility. Bless you both Kitt


 Pro Glo Just doing a check in on how things are going with your Aunty and you Luvs LYN


 I know exactly what you are going thru. I just recently had to place my Gma in an assisted living center. She lived with me for 4 years and her dementia and health declined so rapidly that the Gma that I once knew was gone. She seems to have settled in and is doing well there. They take real good care of her and she has even made some friends. Before she was very lonely, even though she had me, my hubby and my 2 kids she didn't have any friends of her own because she pretty much became a shut in. It is not only hard on the person who has the dementia but hard on their loved ones as well. This is a very unfair condition to have! It robs us of the ones we love so dearly. I am glad that you were able to find a nice place to place your aunt. That is the most important thing I think! Some places just don't care for the elderly like they should.


 THere are so many beautiful homes and places we can put our loved ones into I only suggest to all to check them out thoughly as I know you both would have Thanks lil sis Loves Big sis


 I jusy hope we are that lucky if & when I need to go to a new home......."

 Beautiful storied you 2...Really make you think.


 true true...


 That poems is lovely, i love it, i have heard it before but it was the the crabby old lady. Makes u think !


 Take a real good look at their faces their eyes and see from what you see just what they may have gone thru in their loves Nothing more beautiful than to see an seniur couple walking down the streets holding hands faces turned towards one another love in their whole aura It does not ever cost to look


 I love the poem Lyn, it made me cry, sometimes when I see my father-in-law he has a kind of blank stare I wonder what he is thinking. and hoping that what ever is going on that it is good thoughts going on in his head. and other times he is talkative and doesnt have that blankness those are the good times. but we love him either way and always will.


 Sweet Rona . I truly believe those""blank "" stares ( dad does it too ) are the times or things they are trying and do remember yet keep inside ....maybe too painful or could be they feel they need to keep it locked up ya know Either way yes I love this poem it is given to all nurses when starting out .......here in Ontario and I am sure in other Countries as well Take care n have heart he knows you love him I truly believe that with all my heart n soul


 I still love reading this poem


 Dear Lyn, I have not read that story before and how beautiful it was. If we all could look at someone and see the real person inside. Thank you for sharing ........you never fail to amaze me. Love ya always


 Reminding all to Look and Know They are Valuable People in all our LIVES........... LYN


 This Is A Poem Dedicated to all Alzheimers People Crabby Old Man What do you see nurses? What do you see? What are you thinking when you're looking at me? A crabby old man, not very wise, Uncertain of habit With faraway eyes? Who dribbles his food and makes no reply. When you say in a loud voice, ""I do wish you'd try!"" Who seems not to notice, the things that you do. And forever is losing, a sock or shoe? Who, resisting or not lets you do as you will. With bathing and feeding, the long day to fill? Is that what you're thinking? Is that what you see? Then open your eyes, nurse. You're not looking at me. I'll tell you who I am as I sit here so still, As I do at your bidding, as I eat at your will. I'm a small child of Ten, with a father and mother, Brothers and Sisters, who love one another A young boy of Sixteen, with wings on his feet Dreaming that soon now. a lover he'll meet. A groom soon at Twenty, my heart gives a leap. Remembering, the vows that I promised to keep. At Twenty-Five, now I have young of my own. Who need me to guide and a secure happy home. A man of Thirty my young now grown fast, Bound to each other with ties that should last. At Forty, my young sons have grown and are gone, But my woman's beside me to see I don't mourn. At Fifty, once more, babies play 'round my knee, Again, we know children my loved one and me. Dark days are upon me my wife is now dead. I look at the future I shudder with dread. For my young are all rearing young of their own. And I think of the years and the love that I've known. I'm now an old man and nature is cruel. Tis jest to make old age look like a fool. The body, it crumbles grace and vigor, depart. There is now a stone, where I once had a heart. But inside this old carcass, a young guy still dwells, And now and again my battered heart swells. I remember the joys. I remember the pain. And I'm loving and living life over again. I think of the years all too few gone too fast. And accept the stark fact that nothing can last. So open your eyes, People open and see. Not a crabby old man. Look closer And see. ME!! ** I remember this from Nursing days...A good friend reminded me of this .........I love it and it tells the truth from their point of view IMHO**


 Thank you so much for posting that Lyn. As you know I am a nurse too.....I am going to tell you a true story...... Back in the early 1980's I was working in a CCU at Waterman Memorial Hospital in Eustis, Fl.......the hospital staff was all abuzz during our night shift. An elderly gentlemen on the medical floor had disappeared along with his IV pole and IV medication. He was quite ill, the police were called etc. A nurse remembered him saying several times he had to go to Disney World before he died. Disney World was on the South side of Orlando about 70 miles away if I remember correctly. Guess what......when the ticket booths opened in the early am the cars waiting in the parking lot (at Disney World) started inching forward. A car stopped at a booth to buy a ticket and inside an elderly gentlemen with an IV pole ln the front seat asked for a ticket. The police were alert ed....as he later told the nurses back at the hospital he could see the ferry boats, the tram train and that was enough to give him hope. The owner of the car that had been hot wired and stolen from the hospital parking lot did not press charges (you guessed it)! The elderly man did get well and the report we later received was that someone did take him to Disney World. The elderly are so precious. Andrea


 Nope!!!! Was not my car...I am just the nurse relating the story.......the owner of the car the elderly man hotwired was in the ER at the time seeing a doctor. What a surprise when he came out. I am so sorry about your parents. My Dad died in 1996 very suddenly and my Mother in 1999 after staying in my home for 6 months. I still hear my Fathers voice so at least that has not been taken from me.


 I see so many men and woman not being "" seen"" on my daily trips to hospital and geriatric ward I make it a point to stop and say hello it is so sad and takes its toll on all if you have the heart to see the real person sitting in that chair or layingin that bed staring off to God only knows where Distant memories Thoughts of what it should have been Pleasant Memories ** If you have the chance just to talk to them I implore you do so it only takes a moment out of your day and it gives them a day of happiness and belonging once again.........if only for that day Never forget them they are why we are here and they are also what we may end up like Treat those AS YOU wold want to be treated with a heart and all of the kindness you have It is ""Pay It Forward"" Time imo


 Thanks Lil One Hoping it would Seniors are the forgotten souls and that IS NOT right.IF not for them where would we have come from Mom out


 Remember it takes just a few minutes of your time if you can voluteer at NH's or Retirement homes to just visit for those that do not have family or visitors Another thing you can do is if you are going shopping and know of a shut in ( ask Church) and see if you might be able to pick up something they need Sometimes seniors will not have food in their house and basically eat vey lil of what they do have Habits die hard and many dont like to ask you to do anything as they might feel they are putting you out


 It sure does and it is in your studies when taking Nursing Luvs LYN


 Just HOPING to inspire someone with this poem LYN


 I was one of those people that didn't ""see"" the elderly until my grandmother moved in with me almost 3 years ago. Now I seen it up close and personal of the how she is treated by society in general and it has opened my eyes to how valuable the elderly really are. It shocks me to see that others just discount them as if they are second class citizens because they can't contribute to society anymore. Our elderly have so much wealth of knowledge that we need to take advantage of it. And even if they have AD or senility, they might still remember who they are, where they came from and what they have learned in which they could pass onto us. I've seen this poem once before my eyes were "" opened"" and I didn't think much of it, but now that my eyes are wide open; it really hits home.


 Sherry Something told me to bring this up yesterday I am not sure if it was because I wanted to read it again or what I am so glad you do see what OTHERS dont see Our seniors( high percentage) are treated horrible and they are forgotten souls that we should n need to remember that they are the REASON we are here As posted to Rona I truly believe they know who they are to some degree and they want to express it sometimes yet they cannot .they are shoved to the side and forgotten about ..... I am glad you had the chance to have your Grandma move in and for you to see how they are so treated it is very eye opening isnt it .........give her a gentle hug for me .and say thanks .... I miss my Mom so much and I see her everywhere still in the streets we walked along and in the flowers she loved ..In me and in my daughter....... I still can vision her tenderly and lovingly pulling weeds from her Rose bushes ...... It hurts she is gone but I know she is not in pain and she is whole again .......... Just know that if you have a Mom still or Dad whether they have this DD or not LOVE them like there is no tomorrow ( G Grandparents grandparents ect) Sometimes there just isnt .......... Be well and thanks for posting ....

 Ali (luvdogs) this is a good place to put a story about your lady friend as well ..we all have stories ...My mom just passed away a couple of months ago and I am going to post but am not in that ""zone "" yet ........be well .....God Bless..Lyn


 Wow, I'm incredibly awed and encouraged by all of you. Thank you so much for welcoming me into your forum. I feel blessed to read your stories and to share my own story about my special friend in the nursing home. I have been reading through all of your posts over the last several days, and I am deeply touched in my heart by each and every one of you. Lyn...I didn't realize that you recently lost your Mom. I'm so sorry. Your love for her clearly continues to shine. She must have been a remarkable woman to have had such a wonderful daughter. Thank you for all you have done to support others dealing with Alzheimer's. Padraig...Your story brought tears to my eyes. I have not yet married, but when I do, I pray that I can find a husband as devoted and loving as you. You truly inspire me. Alzheimer's may be robbing your wife's memory, but it is not robbing your love for her. Thank you for sharing your story. I will keep both you and Jean in my thoughts and prayers. Lyn..You asked me to share more about my dear friend. Thank you so much for providing me with this opportunity. This gracious lady has changed my life in many ways, and I often wonder if we were destined to meet one another. I have been her friend, but she has also been my friend - a very special one too. Even though she is 55 years older than me, I feel a connection with her that cannot be accurately described with words. I first met Carolyn shortly before Christmas of this past year. My two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels had just been certified as Therapy Dogs, and our first official visit was to one of the nursing homes in my area. Little did I know that I would soon form a close friendship with one of the residents of that home. When my dogs and I first entered Carolyn's room, I could definitely tell that I was in the presence of a die-hard dog lover. On her walls, paintings of all of her dogs in her life proudly hung. In addition, many framed pictures of her dogs were carefully placed around her room. Her bed was full of dog stuffed animals. So, as you can imagine, when she saw my two smiling spaniels rush over to her side, she started clapping her hands in excitement. ""Put them in my lap,"" she kept repeating. After I carefully placed one of my dogs in her lap, she hugged him and smothered him in kisses. We stayed about thirty minutes that day, and as we were leaving, she asked if I would return with my dogs for another visit. I promised that I would. And that promise I have held, and will continue to hold, until the very end. After that first visit, I began returning at least once a week to see Carolyn. After placing my dogs in her lap, or in her bed with her, we would share stories. I began to learn more about her and her past during our many conversations. She had been totally independent until about three years ago, when she had a stroke that left her unable to care for herself. Shortly before that time, she had lost her sister, who was her best friend. There was no other family to care for her, so she had to placed in a nursing home. Because no beds were available in the city in which she lived, they had to place her in a home three hours away, in the city in which I live. That meant that she had to leave her friends and neighbors, which upset her greatly. What particularly devastated her, however, was that she had to find another home for her beloved dog. When I asked if the person that took the dog ever sent her pictures or updates, she replied with tears in her eyes, ""No, I asked them not to. It would hurt too much."" Of course, that broke my heart. I began to notice that her memory problems were increasing as the months passed. She would often become incredibly frustrated with herself when she couldn't remember something. Also, I noticed that any excitement or unusual change in routine only worsened her memory problems. What most disturbed me, however, was that she was seeming more lonely and sad. When my dogs and I arrived at her room, she was always sitting in her chair with a sad and distant stare. Once she saw that my dogs and I had come to visit, however, her face would light up. Clearly, she needed my dogs, and somehow, my dogs sensed that as well. We began to visit her more often, and we spent longer times with her. Now, my friend has good days and bad days. Usually, when we first arrive for a visit, she has the most memory problems. Interestingly, after she has been holding my dogs for about fifteen minutes, she does much better. For her entire life, dogs have been incredibly important in keeping her happy and healthy, and I think that now the same holds true. Sometimes, when we leave, she shuts down. I know that life in a nursing home has been incredibly hard for her. She once told me that all she wants is for a dog to sleep in her bed again. I wish that I could do more for her. For now, I'm just trying my best to educate myself on Alzheimer's, and of course, we visit her often. Every time she forgets something, though, my heart sinks. She really feels like a grandmother now. No matter what, my dogs and I will continue to visit her, even if she ever gets to the point that she no longer recognizes us. I apologize for my long post. When I write, I just type and type away. Thank you again for all of your support. It's time to put my therapy dogs in the bed. Now, I'm grateful for just the simple things like that. Take good care, Ali


 Thanks to you both for sharing your stories ......it does help doesnt it Ali and Padraig has so much to offer all of us .......Yes I lost Mom in March and it is still very hard for me .....my step dad has AD as well so I am still looking after him........there is not a day that goes by that I do not feel blessed for being given this opportunity ...........never........Take care all and God Bless......How could you not help but smile Padraig? Give G Jean a gentle hug for me Ali, you are Carolyn's Guardain Angel........Your story is wonderful and inspiring ....Thank you ..........God Bless...Lyn Ali do not apologise for the posts being long it is okay and you had a great story to tell......God Bless....Lyn


 Hi Lyn and friends, Sylvia your poem touched me deep. Like Lyn you are blessed to have such Moms. Reading it seeing how you both have the deep love reminded me as a child fantasising about having a Mom. But I grew up as I started work at ten daydreaming finished. At 16yrs I was due for Disposal (not my words, but those recorded on official docs.) I was introduced to my birth mother. This stranger asked me my name, on telling her, she looked at the Christian Brother, ""Are you sure you have the correct boy?"" Thinking did I get it wrong? for if I did I'm in for a hiding. My luck was in when the Brother asked, ""What's your number boy?"" That's something I'll always get right, 11536. ""That's your son"". Weeks later I was given over to her, she didn't have a place for me to stay. This year I have discovered someone lied and still the jigsaw is incomplete. I never got to know the woman as I ran away free for the first time in my life in a strange wonderful world. But like any stray I kept my distance and observed, and still do. Something within me refused to let go the belief there were caring Mothers. Thank you for re-enforcing the belief. From Jean I discovered the power of love, is it any wonder I rejoice in returning that love to this special person who I believe was sent to me. This small glimps of my background shows how my perspective differs from most people's. I have completed my story to the time of our marriage, it had been hard work. It has been suggested I do the second story of our life. Of course the longest chapter would be on my caring. I've had a wonderful life and would be pleased to share it with others. I'm not interested in making anything, just hope it might help others. I have recently been told I'm dyslexic! how funny is that? May your God go with you Padraig


 I will be in bed most of day today have bronchitis and not feeling to good ..time to quit smoking ........Take care all and God Bless..Lyn


 Hoping you post and let me know how you are doing ......God Bless..Lyn.........Here's to a Great Father's Day for you Padraig..........Miss You........God Bless..Lyn


 I am so happy to see you .....I figured something was wrong or you would have been on here........I would think for sure it would be withdrawal from meds .why do they constantly over medicate ......You see most times in homes they (the patient ) is in bed not active not getting any kind of interaction at all ..just medicate....I dont think half or more is needed........I really think peeps are to afriaid of this DD to want to learn about it and that saddens me as we have lots to teach from a caregivers stand and as a person with DD...just know you are making a contribution here thats a blessing itself .........I hope all goes well for you and sounds painful I will always find my Dad funny and fulfilling yep even sometimes agravating lol but Oh how I love him ,he is not doing to bad considering ..lots of yard sales and such ...on to this kick with Casinos.......had to say no to that.....he has always been a bettting man on the horses and I will still do that occaionally with him but I am not a Casino person.........Take care and keep posting ..Lots of love to you and G Jean............God Bless......Lyn

 Hi Lyn, Thanks for your help. There's no way I would tell or advise anyone to take on caring for a loved one without help and support. My purpose is simply to show why I came to undertake caring for my wife without help. The system as I saw it failed both my wife and I. There was and still is a lack in understanding of the deep bond of love that exists between us. I consider us as one and expected to be treated as such. When I was becoming a pain in the neck to the staff at the nursing home looking out for the intrest of Jean. The matron left me speechless with the remark: ""You realy do take 'till death do us part serious' "". A meeting was convened attended by my daughter and I to discuss my removing Jean. I expressed my wish to take back control of our lives. Leaving the meeting my daughter: ""Dad they are pleased to be rid of both you and Mom"". ""Why do you say that?"" ""They expected you to complain about the place, with spending long hours there you saw too much"". I didn't care, I was getting her home soon. I recall saying, and repeating many times: There is no one or any thing out there, I can do this alone. Didn't I spend the first 16yrs of life alone. The first night home togeather I was apprehensive and not a little scared. The next morn all my worries melted away to see her smile, I knew I had done the right thing. More than three years later still caring alone I couldn't be happier. This girl has inspired me with her love to achive things I never thought I was capable of. I spite of her lack of speech or movement she still inspires me. How I wish I could give some of my determation to the less fortunate. May your God go with you.


 Sylvia this is a great thread for the story you posted .........God Bless....Lyn


 Hope all are doing well ........God Bless..lyn


 Hi Lyn and greetings to all, All the tasks that should be done I fail to complete in a day in spite of setting my alarm back to 0510 hrs. I must do my morning run and as the weather is better I push Jean around my 3 and a half mile route. Friday I took her on our twice weekly shopping when she became upset at seeing and hearing a small child loudly howling in the hope of being carried. I smiled as I watched the Mom talk softly to the child. ""Jean he's testing his Mom, but she's not giving in"". I enquired of the Mom ""Is he going to win?"" Smiling she replied ""No"". It's too easy to become upset at the vunerable who's ability to communicate is limited. When Jean appears upset I just smile and put her good hand on my nose and tell her to yank it. Some times she looks sad. Is she asking, ""Am I a burden?"" It's at times like these I tell her ""Ah God love ya, are'nt you a dote"". I think if she could talk I would hear the the oft repeated phrase ""Your strange"". Last night as I was giving her the drink after the meal, I was tired and wanted her to hurry up. Taking a good look at the picture of her mouth and chin covered in chocolate and her making a noise as she blew bubbles in her bottle. How could I get upset? Ali we are closer to dogs in make-up than we might think. I always quote the analogy of myself as an abondoned abused stray when first released from state custody at 16. Having seen the violent death of a playmate in the institution and not being touched by it, except to say ""He's better off"" shows how emotionaly barren I was. It was not until I met Jean did she touch my very soul. Like a stray she won over she'll never get rid of me. May your God go with you Padraig


 Hoping all are doing well and having a great time with loved ones anf friends.......whether they have AD or not I am a firm believer they know we are there for them .....and love them unconditionally........God Bless...........Lyn


 Padraig ....I am so sorry for you and the pain you had to have felt not having your Mom and being known as a number.........God gave you G jean and she has given you the abilty to love and be loved .....You are so good for this forum and I am glad we have you with us .......Sylvia's poem touched us all .........Please give G Jean a big yet gentle hug from me .........God Bless........Lyn


 Padraig ..........How are you I am starting to worry about you and G Jean ....have not heard anything from you .....Is everything okay??......God Bless....Lyn


 Hi Lyn, It has been hell without a landline. It ment I had no phone nor access to the internet for almost a week. It proved very stressful as I hate asking people to let me use their phone. I pray it's OK from now on. Jean is keeping well, except that she is sleeping much of the day. Like every aspect of Alzheimer's the different signs come and go, until they stay. Her limbs are much stiffer some days more than others. Like a child she holds on to my clothing or hands when I wash or dress her, also holds on to the towel when drying her. The first year home she had tremors her hands would tremble it was explained away as part of the illness. I never noticed it vanish over time, could it be withdrawl symptions when I removed all the medication she was receiving at the nursing home? My present concern is her hiccups, can it be some thing I am feeding her? what's the cure? I am off to the hospital tomorrow to have an operation on my gum, it should be interesting when I turn up with Jean. It was carers' week last week and I paid a visit to a show bus they had in the town centre. I found it strange no one wanted to learn about Jean, I was told I was very lucky to be able to look after her without any help and I was a ""one off"" one in a millon. Questions I asked, they were unable to help with, I just get on with it, telling myself 'so what's new' Must dash and bath Jean before evening meal. How are you and your Dad? try to get as much full fillment as I do caring for Jean May your God go with you Padraig


 Hoping all went well with you at the dentists ..How is G Jean doing ...Gentle huggs to her from me .......God Bless.Lyn


 Hi Lyn, Yes I have been having trouble with connecting to the intenet. Had our son over all yesterday says he fixed it, addmitted he made errors before. I expected treatment at dentist, it turned out to be a checkup to find what I required done. The hospital staff and dentist seemed surprised at my taking Jean everywhere with me and asked about help I received:""I look after my wife 24/7 and don't want any help thank you"" The dentist said I looked remarkably fit and thought that was why the infection was being contained. They said Jean looked real well. I managed to convince them to give me an early date for the operation to remove a bit of infected root from my gum 6th July. I have to convince myself I can cope no matter what after the operation. Hope you and your Dad are keeping fine, enjoy the moment. At last I am getting on with my early life's story and expect to finish it soon. It will help me to put it behind me. Jean sleeps much longer now, it gives me time to write. Best wishes to you all. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Hi Lyn and fellow carers, I had completed a message and pressed post that meant the end of it. So here goes again. I note your post is at 0400hrs don't you sleep? You must take care of yourself for the sake of your Dad and your own wellbeing. You must be reading my mind as I was considering asking if you would mind reviewing a chapter of the story at a time. I have finished it, but am still crafting it am starting the 3rd chapter. As Jean sleeps a lot, it gives me time to get on with it. I will be pleased to get the early years over and done with and maybe gain peace of mind. Two things I can't understand from reading the entries from experts and fellow carers. How come Jean knows me still, most say their loved ones don't know them. It is said it is impossible for one person to care for a loved one alone, I have been doing it for years. The sadest statement too oft repeated is ""I can't bear to visit him/her it's too painful, I want to remember him/her the way they were"". Could it be a case of nature and no nurture when it comes to my perspective on life. After all nuns could not get emotionally involved with the children in their care. The blessing is when affection is shown its value is overwhelming. Please take care of your self and savour the moment. May your God go with you. Padraig.


 Hi Lyn, Still having problems with connecting to web. AOL beleive they sent faulty equipment and will replace it by Mon 3rd. Also arrange to have our phone line checked. Sorry to hear your sores are playing up again, is there no quick fix? It is illnesses like yours and others which go to re-enforce my appreciation of my own wellbeing. I have just returned from a three mile walk with Jean. She keeps leaning to one side and her head falls back, I'll have to get working on that. I have just been looking through Jeans closed medical diary from the day of her arrival home, 46pages. Drawings of the preasure sores, gradings and sizes. Notes on medication like morphine etc plus installing a catheter. It is hard to believe she was so ill and I believe it was due to lack of proper care. I can't blame anyone, the needs of both the carer and patient are not properly understood. Sadly no one appers interested in learning from the experts- the carers. Thus the reason for joining this forum. May your God go with you. Padraig."
dealing with the loss,"hi all, i'm new to this forum. i lost my mum 14 months ago, she had alzheimers for 8 years and i was her 24/7 carer. i gave up everything against the advice of the PHN to care for my mum. but now shes gone i feel so lost and empty, like i've lossed my place in the world. my mum was my best friend,and when she got alzheimers, she became like my baby. i function on auto, i find no joy in my life, and cant find a job to help me get back to life as it was before alzheimers took hold on my mum. i've been through councling and been told what a good daughter i am to have looked after my mum and ppl tell me, shes in a better place and all i feel like doing is screaming at them...cause they havent got a clue!! my mum was not only my best friend, but in the last 8 years she was my life! i did everything for her. i used to pray for some ease from the struggles i had to go through with mum, but they are nothing to what i feel now. my heart goes out to all who are looking after someone with alzheimers at this moment, cause its hard work, a real labour of love. and if your anything like me, getting some help is a nightmare!!!!!!!! anyway, sorry if this upsets anyone, just really need to talk to ppl who have been there and understand whats going on. all the best, sadeyes2","Hi there I also lost my Mom and Dad withinn 2 yrs of one another I was the caregiver for them also I do know the feelings you are going thru Sometimes I will still pick up the phone just not thinking to call mom or dad I am going to grief couselling'I ahve lost many a patient suffering from this DD But when it is your parents It is definitely a whole new outlook and a lot of feelings you have to deal with I am so sorry for your loss Please do keep posting here and let us try to hlp you out okay'' LYN


 ......YES and YES I am always talking to Mom n Dad not just once or twice as day but all the time 'I ask for their direction with life and help with cait *daughter* I think or rather believe it is more common than many let on ALSO I believe it is really good for my grief and my healing Take care and God Bless LYN


 How are you making out Sadeyes.......... LYN


 hi all, you know there have been times when i though i was losing it, because i spoke to my parents who had passed away. its so comforting to know that others do this too! tyn, you know u could have been talking about my life in ur post, my bros 2 of them. who i looked after most of my life, fecked off and left me looking after both dad and mam. all in all i was looking after both parents ten years, and i can tell u, that u dont feel that time going by. sometimes i think i was so busy looking after my parents that i didnt see days,months,years passing. my bros actually let my dad go into a nursing home, rather than help out dad ended up in a nursing home because i couldnt cope with him, he was very agressive after he had a few mini strokes. it nearly killed me when my dad went into the NH. you know the day my mam died, i sat at the back of the church while my bros sat up the front bawling their eyes out. i didnt even cry. why do ppl do that? why cry for ppl when u didnt care what happened to them while they were alive? at the moment i'm doing ok, but i'm dreading the 20th cause its my mams birthday. anyway, talk again, have to get to bed, because its 00.09 here. my prayers are with you all sadeyes2


 .....Sadeyes ONE way I have learned to deal with all of the losses especially the one with Dd only mths ago is to CELEBRATE his life and to remember all the good love and good things did on his tim here I admired him,adored him and loved him as no one else could Mom and I were friends too but I still am having trouble with both at times This is when I get out of the ""stinking thinking MODE"" and Ceebrate all the love they shared with us **I also have done a collage of pics of them and us kids on an old huge mirror ( it was a mess) and it turned out to be beautifful It hangs in my Living Room........... Have you thought of doing something like this ?? Just a thought Keep posting plz WE doKNOW the pain you are going thru .........WE will be here God Bless LYn


 Hi Sadeys, There is no way that I can understand how you must be feeling nor how our daughter and son feel at the loss of their Mother, my wife. She passed away last year 12/12/07. I cared for her alone 24/7 for years and now I have come to understand what people meant when they called me 'a one off'. No one can councel me and like you say there's no expert that has a clue. The hardest part for me is not understanding the deep pain our son and daughter must be feeling. It's strange when I look back to what I once said to my wife in the early years of our marriage: ""I'm lucky because I'll never know the pain it must be to lose a parent"". Until my wife came along I'd never known the meaning of love or friendship and had never experienced emotional hurt or pain. Placed in State custody as a two year old (I was a bad boy) and released as a 16 year old to make my way in the outside world. No better than a stray dog I was happy to be free and knew nothing of customs like birthdays etc but at least I was free of the pains I did understand physical and hunger. My wife Jean, was the first person to embrace me and I her, (you see Nuns did not/could not embrace the infants in their custody). To discover love was the most wonderful thing, but also love hurts, and how. Jean gave me a purpose in life and when she became ill with Alzheimer's an overwhelming surge of love burst forth that gave me the strength to care alone to keep her alive five years longer than the medical profession predicted. I'm alone again and there are days I feel totaly lost. I'm still questing myself as I did her so often: ""Why did you ever marry a stray like me?"" Her answer was always the same: ""Because I love you."" One statment that I made without thinking, stands out, when told by a doctor that he thought it was wonderful the way I cared for my wife, I replied: ""no it isn't"" Shocked he asked: ""Why ever not?"" me ""Don't dogs look after their pups."" Sadeyes, Why did you care for your Mum? Because you loved her. If it helps I tell our children ""Look in the mirror and see your Mum, you are of her."" I wish you well and may your God go with you. Padraig


 hi padraig and lyn, thank youy so much for replying. and sorry for ur losses it seems like there are days when i can cope somewhat and theres days where all i want to do is lay in bed and hide from the world. padraig, ur post really touched my heart! my hubby is like urself, he too was in care and never knew what love was...even today he struggles with this. hes often told me i could have done better him funny thing is i couldnt have done any better what other man would stood by me,with me looking after my mam and dad for almost 10 years! hes been my rock throughout all the struggles i've had with mam and dad and was always there with a shoulder for me to cry on when things got too much for me. i'm sure your wife felt the same about you, and yes, if your anything like my hubby you may have had your moments, but u were there for ur wife till the end and thats what counts!!! i know in my heart that my mam wouldnt want me to waste my life being miserable, and i'm sure your wife would have felt the same! i think we need to run with the good days and make the most of them, and do whatever comfort's us on the bad days. lyn i so get what u mean about going to ring ur mam or dad. i actually went to the counter to buy a sleeveless jumper for my dad and ran out of the shop bawling because i realised he was no longer with me...i must have seemed a right fool to the casheir. i always thought that life is so strange...its like 1.2.3 and ur gone and everybody goes back to their lives. but having had both parents die, i realise that it only seems like that, its the family thats left behind who are left to deal with the loss and greif and the pain of losing someone they love. i have a question,do either of u still talk to the ppl who passed? when i get really bad days, i talk to my parents asking them to help me get through the day. sounds mad i know, but it helps. all the best, sadeyes2


 Hey Sadeyes2: I am so sorry for what you've been through and what the road ahead holds for you. Not only are we isolated and obsessed with the well being of our loved one with this horrid disease, we are ostracized from the workforce due to the gap in our employment history. As far as getting help, while caring for our Alzheimer's relative or parent, there is no help. There is the fiction of services however, they dig into your private business and get into your affairs and then inform you, there is no assistance available because you're a relative. Relatives are not recognised as caregivers. It's like, if it's your parent, it is expected that you will care for them. If that were true, where are the rest of the siblings? Out living their lives, their way and wouldn't even try to find money to help when we had no food or gas. My brother is a university professor. He claims he is struggling, financially, well he want's to step into my shoes for a week or so. Then he'll understand ""sruggling"". It is not having to settle for the second best caterer for your Christmas party b/c the best is too expensive. Yup, they're struggling. Sis, well, sis. Last I heard she got busted for contraband at the airport while trying to fly down, pick up Dad although she has been forbidden to do so by Adult Protection, and wanted to take him 4000 miles away from his wife, brothers and sister as well as myself who's been in this position as caregiver 24/7 for over two years. I wish I had an easy answer for you. I know here, if I had to get work quickly, I'd have social services fund my entrance in to a Personal Care Worker course, employment is guarenteed because the population is top heavy with elderly folk needing care. That's likely the road I'd take. I once was a specialist on High Risk Youth in Social Services, as well, I worked at a children's hospital. Not much chance of wheedling my way back in there. To much time has passed and it's all highly competitive. Good luck and see if you can find somebody to help, often, that helps fill in the hole left by the loss of a loved one.


 Sadeyes2, Seems to me you have a good man to stand by you. I have many very low days, but then I've learned to keep going and tell myself I'm getting soft: things could be worse, the very worst would be to have AD. It is so hard for me to relate to others as my perspective on life is so different. Sorry I was never in care, I was sentenced by a Judge to fourteen years as a two year old. Up to recent years the state were in denial and so was I that I had served time. Two months ago I won an admission from the authorities that I had suffered abuse and starvation etc. They had little option, too many wittnesses came out in the recent years and with the internet anyone can read about Industrial Schools. My stay in these places at the time never affected me, I knew no different. The one thing I can't discover is why everyone abandoned once I was put away. The little I do know I learned in 2006. The good that came from it was I entered the university of the world uneducated, and what a wonderful education I'm still enjoying. One aspect as a caregiver was a humbling and educational experience. The shopping, cooking, washing, ironing, cleaning every day year on year and caring for the baby she had become brought home sharply what most men take for granted for what their Mums and wifes do over a lifetime. Now I try not to look ahead, just take each day at a time and just hope there may be something nice around the corner. When I cared for my wife I stayed in what I called the NOW and was greatful for each moment as they passed. My wish was granted, that I be there the whole 12 year journey. I can well understand you talking to your parents. My first experience of that was the feeling our younger daughter, who was suddenly killed stayed close to console me during the raw pain I'd never known up to then. I'd cried for the first time in my life. Now I know Jean is all around looking out for me. Knowing it was her that inspired me with her quiet gentle and kind ways she has left a lot of herself in my being. It's been my very good fortune to have been blessed with my own special angel, so I count my blessing, few have been so fortunate. I hope my perspective helps a little. I wish you well. May your God go with you. Padraig


 dear sadeyes, first i'm very sorry for the loss of your mother. my momma died 2 months ago. i know how you feel when you say you feel so lost and empty. and there's no joy in life anymore. i feel all those things. momma was in a nursing home, but i went there every day for years. i seldom missed a day. now i have no where to go. momma was my life. i haven't been leaving the house. i've made an appointment with a councelor. maybe that will help. i hope things get better for you. your in my prayers."
"Help, Bunions?","My 73 yr. old Dad, alzheimer's victim, has these hugh pockets of fluid, yellowish in color, with bright red centres, almost like a hugh (two inch) pimple right on the ball of his big toe(s). Right side is slightly worse than left, but both look very sore. He can barely walk, and is angrier than a bear who was interrupted from hibernation. I have taken him to the doctor twice. The first visit, the doctor looked at his feet and said ""he needs special orthotics, but since you can't afford that, I'll call drugstore and order special insoles"". They ordered the insoles, next day I got them, he tried them on, grumbling cause they cost $17.00, and when I asked how it felt to walk, he said ä "" little better"". So, the following week he was scheduled to have a squamous cell carcinoma frozen on his upper ear, so in we go. The Doctor (who actually seems afraid of my Dad), flew into the room with this little cup of nitro and dabbed Dad's ear for a minute and ran out saying, make an appt. in two weeks for the second nitro treatment. Erstwhile my dad was struggling to get his shoes off, I explained to Dad the Doc couldn't look at his feet that day cause he was running from examining room to examining room, dabbing nitro on a bunch of people, and of course the nitro was evaporating at room temperature. As the doc flew by me, I said ""so we'll make an appt. to have his feet looked at?"" The doctor tossed back over his shoulder ""we already dealt with his feet, make an appt. to do the second freezing on the ear."" So either this doctor has an aversion to feet, or he doesn't think people over a certain age should be using up precious scarce medical resources, or he's afraid to tell Dad what I discovered in my research, that bunions are here to stay, there isn't much you can do but cushion them, or what, but in addition to having to care for a declining toddler, who thinks he's running the show, I now have to live with an angry bear. The thing is, if I take him with me, when I go for groceries, etc. he has a fit waiting in the car. He refuses to accompany me into the store, bank, etc. If I tell him he needs to wait at home with my cell number taped to the phone, first he has a tantrum about me going out and not inviting him to come, then he calls friends and neighbors and tells them I've left him, I've been gone for six days etc. What fun. I think I have help coming early next week, my son is talking about coming and staying a while. But back to the bunions, anyone have any info as to how to treat these? Make him more comfortable, anything. As it is right now, he can barely walk. Next step will be a wheelchair if we can't get his feet healthy again. My Dad, the farmer, and woodsman who used to haul logs out of the woods on his back, in a wheelchair? I cant even begin to fathom that concept. Thank-you for bearing with me through this long descript ion.","Thank-you. I'll call his doctor and see if he'll make a referral to an orthopaedic surgeon.


 Thanks again guys. My Dad's feet are terribly important. He would not tolerate a wheelchair.


 You can take him in to have a bunionectomy. This is a surgical procedure done by an orthopedic surgeon. http://www.answers.com/topic/bunionectomy One of my friends had this done as well as surgery for her hammertoe and she hasn't had any complaint since she had it done.


 GREAT input RED You are the the best ........... I would have said to do same ............ Keep us posted Luvs LYN"
Obsessions,"Is there a way that I can get my gma to ""forget"" about certain obsessions she has? For instance, the ladies at the center took her ""panties"" (Depends) away because she was tearing the stuffing out. They bring her a couple at a time now. But my gma, the way she was acting, was like there was some major conspiracy. She obsessed over them for a long time and it was worrying her like mad. Also now, she has this weird obsession - she told me that when she goes completely blind (from MD) that she wants me to give her a shot and put her to sleep. I had to explain to her that just wasn't an option because it's against the law and considered murder! But she keeps bringing up the subject and is becoming obsessed over the whole idea. And every time I see her now, she tells me this - her words verbatum ""I have been thinking and it was a very rough decision for me. But when I go blind, I want you to put me to sleep."" My words verbatum ""Gma, I can't do that. They put dogs to sleep not humans. Besides it's against the law and it's called murder. You don't want me to go to jail do you?"" Yes, I know the words by heart because it has occured so many times exactly as I stated. But the problem is with these obsessions is that it sits in her mind for a long time and it worries her to death. Any ideas to get her to calm down and try to get her to forget about these things?","Thanks Lyn. I have tried to reassure her that if she goes blind that I will be her eyes. But my lordy that is got to be the worse - going blind, loss of hearing and loss in her own mind! But I will bring this up with her doctor and see what he has to say.


 I talked to her doctor and he is going to have a P doc give her an exam. So we will see what he has to say - hopefully he will see her in the next couple weeks.


 Hi, Why don't you just tell your grandma you will follow her wishes and let her have a piece of mind? I think she just want people to listen to her and whether you will follow through with it well... she'll never know. My mom has OCD too along with her dementia and PD tremors. Her doctor prescribed an anti-psychosis medication which when I researched on the net it said could cause early death in the elderly. Needless to say I didn't get it for her. My mom's anxiety is getting pretty bad. She gets jumpy over every little noise or sound she hears. Does anyone know what is a medication she can take so I can ask her doctor about it? Thanks.


 Oh wow! My mom would ask about the little ones as well on some days. She usually snaps out of it though. A doll wouldn't make her believe it's the real thing though. 3 years ago while she stayed at my sister's house for 2 weeks she always asked for the little me. Even going as far as saying she needs to report me missing to the police. It's the insecurity talking. She constantly goes through her purse looking for money. When she's at the hair salon she does the same thing. One time she got up and wanted leave because she didn't have enough $ in her wallet but they keep reassuring her that I would be back to pay them when I return from running an errand. I read the newer SSRI's are not good for dementia patients but I will ask about Clomipramine. Thanks!


 Sherry This is a rough one Once they get the obsessive thinking going it is very difficult and almost unlikey that it will stop I might suggest that you do talk to the doc or neuroligist to see if there is any way that this can be stopped or at least halted to a point where it is not an every time she see's you occurence Everything else I am sure she feels has been taken away from her and maybe she is thinking in her own way that it would be less of a burden for you Tell her that IF she goes blind you will be her eyes for her letting her know it is not the same thing but at least it is something........ There has to be something they ( doc s) can help you /her with the obseesive thoughts she is having I am hoping that you can find a way to get this resolved you and your gma have gone thru the wringer ............. God I wish I could be more help........ I am so sorry PLz email me if you would like ........LYN


 Yes it is rough I have lost hearing .......and with the fibro fog so much of my memory I just have no idea what it would be like if we could not see Your GMA hads lost so much hun and you are doign all you can KNOW THAT


 PLease keep me ( us ) posted LOL I was just thinking that dad had the weather channel on all the time 'I CANNOT bear to hear the music fromit Also he was in Beverly Hillbilly's What a man.....Miss him so


 There was an older anti-depressant Clomipramine, I believe that was helpful with OCD. I used to work with a client who was given this older AD and it helped. She was obsessed with pulling her hair out. Also, the vets use it (Clomicalm), they call it. I had a yellow lab, he nearly chewed his front paws off from anxiety. Same medicine, different dosage, and of course five times more expensive through the vet. I asked my PCP one day if she could prescribe it for my dog. needless to say, ""nope, I can't prescribe for the dog"". I was led to believe some of the newer SSRI's are supposed to help with the OCD, I don't know which ones. The obssession stuff is very wearying for caregivers. My dad has these quirks that if I didn't ignor them, I would need to be institutionalized, myself. Daily habits that drive me crazy. My Gramma had some habits, due to her alzheimers, that were bothersome until we, her caregivers loosened up and let her ""have at it"".Every few minutes she would look up at whoever was there and proclaim ""where are the little one's?, Oh my gosh, who's looking after the children?. So we went and got four dolls, aged apart like her grown children. An infant, a one yr. old a three and a five. Plus their various accessories. We would line them up on the sofa. She fussed over the infant continuously. She would try to feed her dinner to it so we got a bib. Then she would try to wash it's face and nearly had the mouth and nose rubbed off. We found another to replace it and that baby went everywhere with her (which wasn't very far, believe me). They did find her in nightdress and bare feet in winter a block away, pounding on the church door. A neighbor called and my uncle went and got her. She claimed her husband was trying to kill her. After that they had to keep deadbolts locked on all doors and hide the keys, nearby. about the Hemlock thing, has your Gramma, a living will? If there was some way to reassure her that all that business has been taken care of and written down on paper, maybe, you could keep a copy or a statement of any sort that reflects her wishes next to her bed, then you can reassure her it's all taken care of, signed, sealed and delivered, see,""just look in the drawer"". It's very hard to play into these delusions, you cannot rationalize with an irrational person. Distract them, as you might a three year old. I wish I had more answers."
Can AD effect You At Age 25???,"Hi Everyone, I have a question , I need help if can Alzhiemer's effect you at the age of 25? Due to depression and anxiety ....... ** Just put a title to thread for you this way you should get more answers** IF you want to change title to your words go to edit on your post and put them in to NOT a rule breaker just easier to get answers and support LYN Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 12/10/2008 8:50:45 AM (GMT-7)","hi....i have unfortunately had to research early onset alzheimers and as far as i can tell there has never been a diagnosis in anyone that young...good luck, i hope you find answers to your symptoms....


 I've never heard of Alzheimers in someone that young, but there sure are a lot of other things that can affect your memory. I'd want to see a neurologist, possibly have an MMRI. I've had friends with disorders totally unrelated to alzheimers that have memory loss. Also, being under a great deal of stress can do it.


 .....IN all honesty I with all the research and my nursing career I have not known of someone getting Alzheimers at this age Anxiety/ Depression can also give you the forgetfullness and other SX .......... Personally and this is ONLY my opinion you have nothing to worry about YOU can ask your doc for a Memory Test............ Stay with us LYN And Welcome


 Thanks for your input.....


 MY fibromyagia causes me a great loss of my memory YES many other DD can cause this my friend See a neuro I am getting a Memory Test Score done after holidays"
Tics,"This latest manifestation on my Dad's part, is spitting. He'll sit and spit all day. He does use a tossue, but there's nothing to spit. It;s like he has a hair in his mouth and is doing that thing you do when you have a hair on your tongue. He also makes this ""giddy-up noise where he clacks his tongue, mostly when we are driving and truthlfully, it's getting hard to occupy the same space with him. Once I asked him if he would mind not spitting until I finished eating my dinner and he flew off the handle about ""änd you missy, think you're going to tell me what I can and cannot do"", you know, the usual. So, I just stopped eating around him. As far as the clacking with the tongue I just tell him (in the car) ""please stop making that noise"", it's distracting for me. So that one works b/c he doesn\t want to have a time out, if he's yelling or disruptive while we're driving I just find a safe spot and pull over untill evertone is sensible again.","Well, we just do o the best we can. I had a supervisor onve say,"" pollywog,, life is just a series of adaptations. i just have to keep trying to adjust.


 Gals, you're bang on. He is getting used to me sitting and waiting while he eats. It doesn't seem to affect his spirits, or his appetite too much. When he asks ""ären't you having some dinner?"", I just say I got really hungry earlier and couldn't wait. He seems satisfied with that. Our schedules are staggered, anyway. My time is between 8 PM and 11 PM (when I can manage to stay awake that long. His are more like 7AM to 8 PM. I always get up at five, get dogs out, make coffee open blinds, turn heat up, and then head back to bed for a couple hours. He gets up 7 or 8 AM, gets his coffee, makes his toast, that's all he knows how to cook but there's tons of fruit, cheese, buiscuits, etc., sitting around everywhere. The two other things that seem trivial and silly, but will make you crazy are a phrase 'tickrty tock and tockity tic. Harmless enough unless you hear it every two minutes all day for two years. The last is that tongue clacking thing, like giddy-up to a horse. He does chew gum. Doublemint because that's what his father chewed. There is always gum in the house. I don't go down to the corner w/o bringing back gum. Both dogs are wearing it, stuck mostly to their hind quarters, it's purelt haute coiffeur. Brittany and Biancia will be sporting it come spring. Thank-you and Happy New Year.


 hey all, thank-you Lyn and Happy New Year. Apparently, I guess, my son, is supposed to come up tomorrow, and stay for a while. That will help lots cause he talks with Dad about hunting and fishing trips they went on, that sort of stuff. Dad and I have very little in common. He left us with our crazy mother when I was ten, the oldest, of three. I practically raised my brother and sister. But Dad and I, there's not much there between us, we spent some time together, he bailed me out of lock-up a couple times, and such, but there's not much to remenisce about . Hope you all are surviving terrible blizzards, 72 hour layovers at airports and all the other fun winter holliday games.


 Actually, it's my son who is coming, brother and sister are non-responsive. However, the only concern I have is that Dad and my son might lock horns. For example, when my son was here for xmas, dad got up after midnight, walked into living room where my son was watching TV and just walked over and shut TV off. I've warned Dad that behavior is unacceptable in this household.


 My son is here. I went to the big city and brought him up, and bot a moment to late. Because it's his first night up, and because my Dad is rapidly declining, I didn't lock my bedroom door because I thought if my son needed totalk or couldn't find something, he would pop in to ask. That would be ok. In stead, at 3:37, I awoke to a six ft. three man towering over me yelling about his dog. Apparently, the little dog (which is not his dog, I found it, trained it, get up everyday at 5 AM to walk him, feed him and take him to the vet, unkless sitting in your chair yelling his name bestows ownership rights he's my dog. Here's the thing, because of Fibro, sleep is a very difficuly thing for me to obtain. When I don't sleep property I get terrible migraines and even fibro flares. Just this past two weeks has been much better for me, physically and mentally because my doctor hiit on valium, my muscles totally relax, andmy Fibro has improved due to being more relaxed and actually sleeping. I feel like we're at some kind of turning point. I'm feeling terrified in my own home.


 tyno3 I think you did the right thing by not eating when he is. You could still be near by so he does not feel alone when eating but I understand how the spitting could be hard to deal with. It is so sad this is happening to your Father but you are so devoted, be proud of you. Hugs Kitt


 Sometimes with meds they may develop a tickle in the back of mouth causing them to THINK they have spittle but more likely than not they dont IS he able to chew on a small piece of gum??? I agree with Lil sis you are dong right bu y not eating with him but do reinforce the reason with him Tell him HOW it makes you feel to see this and it takes your appetite away ...... Just a thougth

"Aunt with Alzheimer’s, I am so tired and no help","My Aunt was diagnosed with the onset of Alzheimers Disease in January 2008 and my Moms and I have attempted to care for her since then. My aunt stayed with my mom after being hospitalized in march 2008 for hallucinating reallyy bad because she was not taking her meds back then she lived by herself she also started getting aggressive with my mom because she didn't want to take her meds she also had a medical bracelet which she took the info paper and threw out on 3 seperate occasions also kept telling my mom she wanted to go home so she did. and she has progressed rather quickly she also has high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes not insulant dependent we have tried evrything as far as her taking her meds she still hides them and only takes them when we are in front of her face her son moved down form Puerto Rico to care for her but she dislikes him soooo bad that she has gotten very agressive with him to the point of blows and sometimes he wakes up because she is over his bed with her eyes open very wide he is afraid she will hurt him while he sleeps. She can no longer pay her own bills as we found out her bills were not paid for months due to her forgetting she has no short term memory at all. all 3 of her son live out of state 3 men the eldest son lives in Florida the middle child retired from the marines and is relocating to Texas soon and the baby lived in Puerto Rico but decided to try to take care of her but he can't handle all the different situations that occur we are in the process of gettiing her evaluated an assessment to become her conservator because she still has her apartment but leaves stoves on constantly her cooking doesn't taste the same she forgets certain ingredients, still not taking her meds, she wears the same clothing for 5 days if you let her and she not even bathing but says she has when you go to the bathroom it's dry and so is the soap, even though we know she isn't paying her bills she says she has no problems with that or her memory and that she can live by herself and she is very tired of everyone treating her like a child. All we want is what is in her best interest we are afraid she will hurt herself or some one else because when she gets agressive she's very scarrie looking. my aunt hords everything and does not want to throw anything away she constantly through out the day looks for her purse as if some one has taken it and she also started acting as if we are all stealing her stuff. She also constantly is in the bathroom I guess her bowels are not working that well either and she keeps locking all the locks on the doors we are afaraid she will lock herself in one day and not know how to get out and we will just have to break the door down.. basically none of us can care for her at our homes as we have families and have to work and can't afford to pay a nurse 24 hours a day and she can not be left alone it kills me to see her deteriorate so quickly as she has always been self sufficient and has always done for herself and others. Taking care of her is mentally, physically, emotionally and financially draining. and I have no help from neither her Dr, psychiatrist, social worker, or visiting nurse who see's her twice a week for about 10 minutes they all state she presents well and is very talkative and pleasant so I don'y know what else to do we have brought up to her about assisted living of course she said never!!!! our goal now id to have her assessment on the 29th and that the Dr can give a good prognosis on our end so we can get her in an assissted living place and become her conservator so that we can make her decisions forher as she can no longer make them for herself. because we are all burnt out and can't care for her 24 hours a day. Can anyone relate to what I'm going through is she in the last stages ofthis disease what else should I worry about what advise can you give me I just need to hear from anyone to give me some piece of mind should I be doing more or less. Please Help. PR Glo","VERY GREAT INPUT SIS

 ((((((((( PR Glo )))))))))) Sending you big hugs Glo. I'm SO sorry that you are having such a hard time caring for your Aunt. I can't imagine being the primary care taker at this stage. My dad had Alz and my mom, of course, was his primary care taker and I would go over 2 or 3 days a week for a few hours and send her out of the house to visit with friends or shop. I don't know how folks live with this chaos 24/7. So . . . bless you for being so caring. I sent letters to each of my siblings and assigned them each a Saturday each month to care for Dad while Mom had time to herself. That worked GREAT and each one did take their turn for many months. But it sounds like your family is too far apart for that. . . so I'm not sure how you get them involved . . . but they really should be involved. . . . they usually will if they know how to help. . . it just needs to be expressed very clearly (as my letter to my sibs). I had actually telephone each sib a couple times and asked for help . . . they each agreed, but the help never came. When I assigned an absolute day for each, they really stepped up. You may need to take the post you made above . . . and re-write it in very clear paragraphs, making it easier to read. It is really a clear statement of what is going on. This should be provided to each doctor BEFORE the next exam so he/she isn't sitting there reading it in the exam room. Also . . . very clearly specify what you want the doctor to do. I'm not sure what that might be . . . but you should contact your local Alz agency right away and get some good advice from folks who should know what you need. They may need to put her in a facility some time soon if her kids don't step up and figure things out. I'm not sure why this is being left up to you . . . except that you ARE doing the doing . . . so that lets everyone else off the hook for now. You may need to put the kids on notice that they must take over. That would only be right. What would they do if you weren't living so close?? Distance really isn't an excuse to leave your mother's care to a niece. I'm sure you'll get some great advice from HowLynCat when she see's your post. She cared for a mom and then a dad who both had this DD. In the meantime . . . hugs, prayers and . . . Blessings!


 If you look thru resources and other back threads there may be something to help as well ....... I am so sorry for all you and she is going thru I DO know firsthand how it feels having looked after both parents til their deaths ............ LYN Please do stay with us


 Howlyncat, Sorry I haven't written a response on how i'm doing. The answer to your question No I haven't gotten any help except that I had to move her into an Assisted Facility because she can no longer care for herself and can no longer live alone anymore so atleat now I can sleep better knowing she has a nurse on call 24 hrs a day and that they dispense her Meds to her and keep her busy during the day with activities and she has no stove in her room they provide all 3 meals per day. But as with this disease her memory is getting worse and worse. The Assisted Living facility can provide her dial a ride to and from appointments but she can no longer go alone anywhere because she can't comprehend direction or remember to relay messages and I'm afraid she will sign her life or saving away to anybody with out knowing. My Aunt Loves the Facility she is in it's very clean and all staff their and other tenants are wonderful and she has many friends there. I take care of all her mail, bills all her stuff comes to my address and I transport her and go with her to all appointments, I help her with buying a little groceries, It's still very difficult for me as I have my husband, and 3 kids to take care of and I also suffer from Chronic Psoratic Arthritis where I sometimes can't even get out of bed. I have severe Acid Reflux Gastritis, Swolen Stomach, I also have problems with my gallbladder where I need to have taken out. I Love My Aunt Like a Mother always have I am so glad I'm here for her because she has children but only can count on me and I'm happy she is safe and taking her meds. PR Glo


 pro glo there is help out there. i tried to get it for a friend who was diagnoised with alzheimers. and she has had it for 2 years now. You can can get e-mails addresses for the aging and disability services and explain to them the problems you are having and they will put you in touch with someone to help you. you have to be very persistant with these people, but they will help and will assign a case cordinatior for the patient. Let me know if this helps. if not i will get everything i have i did to get alice approved for her care . also she will able to get all medical supplies. like ensure, personal items, vitiams, diffferent. things. good luck


 This is such a common storey amongst us caregivers. Isn't it odd that although all these behaviors are odd, we are all pretty much dealing with the same issues. The issue of the one being cared for thinking we've taken something of their's, the issue of refusing meds of denying there is anything wrong with them, becoming suspicious and paranoid of us because they think we mean to harm them,the aggression, the rooting behavior, digging through stuff as if looking for somethng but not clear on what they are looking for, and much much more. I am one of the 24/7/360 days a year caregivers, and at my ropes end. I am tired of arguing about stupid stuff spending meaningless time arguing and explaning stuff, over and over, tired of being called out, yelled at, verbally threatened, tip toeing around my own house because I'm afraid of waking the sleeping bear. All I can say is, my son says he is coming tomorrow to help. My siblings may as well, not be related to us at all. They don't even call Dad anymore. Except, they call me about when such and such a property will be sold so they can get their greedy fingers on it. Welcome aboard everyone, anyone, hello, can you hear me now, how about now? Guess they're not available. They managed to get themselves located far far away as soon as the final diagnosis was made. Sometimes I just get furious, but that doesn't help. Makes my other ailments that much worse. Thank-you for listening and Pro Glo, best of luck and love to you for being one of Us.


 Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most. I realise I just comitted plegarism, but so, sue me. At least the time I do will be similar to the time I'm doing now. And, I may stand corrected but, I believe inmates are paid, albeit only 17 cents an hour but paid, nonetheless. My son, I retrieved yesterday in a raging blizzard, a 200 mile drive through white-out conditions because compliments of the zoloft, I take, I was comfortable in my own skin and asked for help from a garage attendant. I asked him how best to get over the mountains in a whiteout. He said get behing a large tractor trailer, they know what's what and stay behind him. I did this both ways and it worked extremely well. Now my son is here for about a week, thank-you Santa, and that means I can lean into the intense body pain from the fibro, and just let my son take over.That initial letdown from stress, it is very intense, and hard to let go. Now Dad isn't following me around the house like a little lost puppy. he's actually talking intelligently with my son, about all kinds of fascinating things like WWII to tractors through to dairy farming. All stuff I've heard plenty about already. Also son is up to getting our mail, depositing chequue, and vip getting the muffler attached to the car. I have (hopefully climbed under there probably 15 times to gerry-rig the exhaust system. If he is sucessful in getting it fixed, it's anoter load off. Now I get to play patient for a while."
How being a caregiver affects you and and your emotions,"It is quite normal to feel some anger at times angry because you are seeing the person you love change and be something they never can revert back to ........ Anger at God may happen too not everyone not for sure but speaking personally I was really angry that I thought HE could do this to Mom a person I loved and needed in my life so much Aperson that was a nurse in Geriatrics and looked after ppl with the dang same disease she ended up with Anger at family members that dont want to help dont know how to help or just plain pretend it is not happening Anger at the socail sevices and mental health ppl for not being there and helping out when you need it as well as anger at the way Most nursing homes are run and how they do not look after your loved one ......Never be ashamed at being angry you have that right you feel you are alone in the battle and it is a darn hard road to travel alone ......... Never show your anger to those you care for walk away as IMO the anger they see or SENSE will only make their behaviour worse ........ Sometimes I know I have gotten angry if Mom would not open her mouth to eat or refuse Only because I knew she needed the food and needed the nourishments I was trying to give her, I also would get angry or frustrated at times for her not remembering me and it was NOT her fault at all but I am human I am not perfect by no means AT the end of the day I would look at her comfy and cosy as a wee babe knowing I had done what I wanted and actually loved and enjoyed doing for her I will nor never would ever change what transpired between Mom and I for anything except her not having that Dang disease She was robbed .....we were robbed .......... I felt she had a purpose and finally I realized HIS purpose for Mom and I was for us to become the Mom and daughter we were and to make lasting memeories while we could not DWELL on the AD itself nor be angry at the DD but LEARN from it and carry on in your heart knowing you have done all you can for those you love just as my parents looked after me changed my diapers bathed me fed me .......looked after food and finances......... It was my turn to pay it forward and show myself I had the strnghth and fortitude love compassion and empathy top give her all she needed with this disease...... Caregivers Need to Realize their IMPORTANCE in our loved ones lives they have some brain function they still light up in their eyes or give a weak but real honest smile a tiny squeeze of the hand or to reach out to you to let you KNOW that they are happy and so glad it is YOU that is there for them and they are not abandoned or alone during this horrid Journey ....... Make the most of your time together never utter something you may regret ........ It will haunt you forever.","Have been exploring all my emotions of late over Mom and dad as well as many other aspects of my life I just need to put them all to one page sorry if I am not really helping I will get there I am trying LYN


 GUILT......... Sometimes there may be feelings of guilt for the way we may have treated someone in the past and feelings of guilt for not visiting enough or showing interest with the person (s) looking after loved ones .......or of the loved one . BUT ....It is not an easy thing for many pple to do it takes strong will determination and you have to give yourself over 24/7 to this person every day not just for one although it can help if you kinda go over and say hey Mom let me do that or Dad or Grampa can I talk her for a walk in her chair?? Dont let this guilt eat you up Sneaky it is and it will if you let it I promise you that You may have guilt over being embarrassed by loved ones behaviour ...DONT.........its hard but try not too ..we need soooooo much more research and info on this DD to show our children to have empathy and understanding some of what is going on not be guilty Dont be embarassed I never was except the one time she( mom) spoiled her pants in store) and a comment was directed to her MOM had tears my embarrassment turned to anger and I so wanted to grab hold of that sacastic woman YET instead I said "" never mind Momma , we will go and fix ya up k and come back to finish up what we were doing"" Mom did not want to go back in but I finally got her laughing about the woman and her lack of finesse and shpping was done I did see that woman again when we wnt back in and told Mom sit tight locked the chair and I had a mission I went to her and very politely said MY MOTHER has Alzheimers and you have not only embarrassed her as well as yourself but you HURT her and made her cry.........Hoping your children are of a kinder mind and heart Have a great day That was that and we carried on and had a good day PLease do share stories here we have to get them out cannot have them all bottled up inside Luvs ta all


 When having to find a home or placement for a Loved one you can no longer look after a whole slew of emotions will erupt prolly Guilt being the first You have to tell yourself that if you cannot do it no more they are better off with ppl that can do it ..........

 Watching those you care for and love going downhill in front of your very eyes is the or one of the hardests things you as the caregiver will have to face Do keep in mind that they are still your loved ones no matter what condition they are in Talk to them show them old pics and really try to keep a routine for them as well as you it is alot easier ' You may also find that many "" friends"" and some "" family"" members cannot deal with this at all and so you are left dealing with most of it all on your own Keep a time for you please make sure you have read thru other emotions I am sure some will hit home with you If possible take them out whether in W/C or not let them see the beauty of nature Some part of them is still THERE YOU have to find it and nourish it with old memories and making many new ones You ( i) are already grieving for the person you have ""lost"" to this Disease and that is something you need to face daily not by choice but by circumstance in the progression of this DD I wish all of you the best and know you are surely 'Angels "" from above Love them always and nuture that Love God Bless The Caregiver


 Make sure you get some down time for you as well It helps not to be overtired and frustrated Your loved ones can feel the emotions still .........


 YES they have this DD that robs them and us of most of them BUT I implore you to make "" Memories "" with your loved ones even if they are bedridden ...... Cuddle them up ,brush their hair .....anything and take pics ...... or if you dont want pics keep that memory in your heart You never know what can happen and I feel strongly about this memories and I know it is my opinion but I felt I needed to share If they are in w/c or using walkers /canes whatever mode .......have them outside with you talk to them about the old days the things you remember they did and the fun and enjoyment you and they had doing these things I still take dad out and go places I made alot of Great memories of mom and they are something I draw on daily Am doing this with dad as well as I know he will not be here much longer.......soon he will be with her and outta the Hell he is in......... I dont want this to happen believe me I will be devasted yet I feel it causes me more pain to see him deteriorate and say "" he wants to just die"" daily ........ It rips my heart out ....... Just my thought and my opinions ** NO offence meant to anyone ** God Bless LYN


 I just read your postings, I'm really touch. It's true and I can feel it. I know exactly what you mean. I see that to our residents, to their family, the mix emotions that you discussed. I'm not a family caregiver, but I'm also a caregiver in a facility and an administrator, employee in short, but I share the common feeling with them. I always talk to our caregiver that they must have patience, love and understanding to our residents. Treat them as their family. We're not here just to do the job, or just for money. We must have compssion to the elderly. Caregiving job must come from the heart. Sometimes the residents are very mean but you must understand them that they are not doing this in purpose, they are sick individual, they have pain and discomfort, if you don''t understand them, caregving job is not for you.


 Thanks Lyn. I'm talking as a private caregiver. It's hard to be a caregiver, it's a stressful job. You're not dealing to the residents alone but also to their family. There are those who don't understand and too demandingn. But of course there is always those who appreciate to what you are doing to their love ones. In our facility, I always talk to the caregivers to love their job. To give their best. Our residents need love and compassion. The families are not always there in time of their needs. When they have pain, we're here to comfort them. In their period of depression, we are beside them. And we feel the sadness of the family when their love ones is gone. Years of taking care the residents develop a relationship filled with love and compassion. Caregivers are here to fill up the needs of the residents that the family could not give when they are in the nursing home or board and care. I hope this happen to all residential care facilites for the elderly where love and care are catered daily.


 I agree totally with both aspects of caring you have posted about ........ LIKE I said you are an asset to this forum Feel free to start threads ( titles) on any subject that you feel is relevant and I may have missed I appreciate your wise and caring ways God Bless LYN


 WOW I am so glad to have come across this today so see that others share the same compassion, and convictions to love, care for and I have worked in long term special care now for 6 years amen to all comments SELF CARE also vital to refuel so we can continue to pour out


 .........Family members may experience a host of emotions when having to deal with those they love with this Horrid Disease Sad Anger Alone Discouraged Frustrated ...sometimes tired and depressed In the face of the reality of a chronic illness .emotional distress IS appropriate and understandable ,sometimes family members find themselves overwhelmed by their feelings As we all know Human feelings are complex and will no doubt vary from person to person Sometimes many will be ridden with guilt thinking their feelings are wrong or unacceptable that they should have different feelings. Most feel alone with their fellings I know I do unless I am able to come here and share and thats what I do ........ The love they feel will or may turn into a "" dislike "" or a feeling of a heavy burden .........IT IS NATURAL to feel this way IMO and also worried about how OTHERS may view them and there caregiving ........ Please keep in mind you are HUMAN you will have mixed emotions with some of this and it is "" OKAY"" If you feel frustrated walk away for a few minutes and think of Happier times and remember they have only you now and that no doubt they would do same for you WHY should we not be there for them Same as spouses **There are more aspects to this post but I would like to see what the response is first I am doing this as a retired Nurse and as a caretaker as well ** Please do not hesitate to add your input positive or negative .......I mean NO disrespect I am trying to let you know it is okay to have these feelings,I know I have ............ MY opinion only God Bless the Caregiver........ Luvs LYN


 Depression is the feelings of sadness and discouragement Often very hard to distinguish between depression and anger ,depression and grief,depression and worry ...... Often most family members caring for the loved one may feel sad,depressed,discouraged or low day after day week after week ........... Sometimes the depressed caretaker can become apathetic and or listless.......they also may feel anxious, nervous, and or irritable The experience of being depressed is very painful in itself and that is something that IF it happening to you needs to be dealt with ........ Support groups or online support such as here does help IMO and sometimes couselling is needed but it wont help all of these feelings 'Just go away"" I find that it helps to share experiences and emotions with other families going thru the same things I may be going thru Having a "" buddy "" system in place is great too for me Alot of the times most family will not want to help out or deal with the loved one as they CANNOT accet what is happening NOT because they dont love them it is just to hard to see and understand ......... Having people to talk to eases some of the feelings we may have I dont get angry but I do get depressed as I watch Dad go down the path to passing each day and I know it wont be long I get sad as well as I know even though he doesnt really understand everything he does UNDERSTAND mom is gone and he wants to be with her........ There are many caregivers out there that wont feel most of these emotions due to their love and devotion to the one they care for but the sadness I am sure hits all and deression I would think gets many as well **Grief for Mom is still quite raw for me I have only lost her almost a year now and I looked after her forr many till she went ......I dont think I have really and truly accepted she isnt just ""down the street"" and I will watch the house just to see hoping it was a a real bad dream and she will come down that driveway ....... These are only my personal opinions NOT ALL ppl feel this way:: as I did say but I do know if I gave self honesty check daily the sadness and depression would be ticked as well as anger I sometimes get angry at My God as I see Him for whatever reason sometimes I have no idea why I am mad at Him I just am,other times it is because I see dad and I saw what this DD did to a vibrant beautiful woman.......I despise this Disease I honestly do This is why I do love Healing Well and the ppl on this forum as I am able to bare it all and they know from where I come As I said not all will have these feelings and I am not trying to portray the caregivers ( me as well ) as horrid angry frustrated ppl ** I am only opening up the topics for discussion IF someone needs to talk or to let them know it is OKAY to sometimes feel the way I (we) do or may do It is a hard day to day job we do 24/7 and it will wear you down but keep a bit of me time to the side if only 10 minutes ya know ** keep self healthy and fit and know you are doing the best job ever in caring and loving that person ......feel free to add anything to this thats what this is about sharing our emotions and our days so...... You are all special people that take the task at hand and work thru it daily hourly ......... God Bless The Caregiver.........and Their Loved Ones........


 Greiving....While Still With Us........Normal ........ I know that I have gone thru 2 "" suddendeaths"" in my life pple that were so close and I loved so deeply that was very difficult to deal with and still is When you are the one seeing your loved one literally going in front of you eyes maybe on a weekly or shorter time frame it is Hades it really is I saw mom go from being out in her gardens and going with me for ""Just ride Lyn just ride"" in the car no destination she just loved the car and being in the outdoors to a woman who hid the fact from dad and all siblings she was sick and wetting self and the as time came on the delusions and the feces soaked pants till I got there or Cait /she only trusted us and was ashamed I know I got her depends and would take her up and have a wonderful tubby for her waiting where we talked about all We had so many good /great talks up in the bathroom just her and i and those I cherish I knew it wasnt gonna last and I also knew the other kids DID not want to ACCEPT the fact the MOm was not perfect now she had problems so they stayed away Me I stayed with her and I grew as a woman by doing this and as a mother I knew and found out more about here that I have in my heart and I know why she did the things she did in life why she always depended on me all of it I made a new memory everyday wheth it was having to cut her pubic hair right close and shave there as well we constantly were laughing that day I had to do that she called me SHAKY,afraid I was gonna snip her ..you know lol.......we could not stop laughing about it for days I said MOM this is not easy ya know lol but we had a memory a funny albeit out of the ordinary memory BUT one just the same THen in the flash of a minute she would be staring off to a place I was not privy too I could not get in nor would I ask her about it it was her ""Place"" WE started getting all the paper work and all done and she was owed alot of money from family (siblings) and it was all written down and in lucid times she had me take her to the notary and I have also a copy Then dad started showing small signs and I thought my God WHY Leaving stove on ligths on just the normal thigs I alwasy was taught to look for when assessing AD peeps Agitation hit him and I believe he knew about mom completely Anyways I had watched her go from about 105 lbs( small and small boned lady) to 65 at death this is not because she didnt eat or have the food avilable she wanted to go she having been a Geriatriv Nurse all her Career did not want to be all balled up and in fetal position losing any aspects of communication totally She was tired of the dirtying self and not remembering putting ON a face not hers ya know She also knew I would and never did take any renumeration for any of what I nor Cait did NOT RIGHT imho for me She told me she was tired and for me to take some time that my sister was coming for this weekend I said MOm I still have to come down and do the baths ands stuff .... I should have known Honest to God I should have known she said no it will be okay I will get Telle or her to do it so that your sores will clear up and you rest for the weekend and so I did but I find out she was sent home by my doc with A toch of pneumonia on the Friday ( no one told me this my doc did ) and was in hospital on Saturday night because my sister with her infinite wisdom DECIDED to pull 40 yr old wall paper and Paint the kitchen with Mom laying on couch Yes they tell me they had fans and ya da ya da ............. Mom was never to come back home again I saw her Sunday just before the alrams went off like crazy said I love you mom and God dont dont leave me yet please............She was intubated and the airlifted to a Hospital in London London Health Science Centre....we were all there this is when I learnt AGAIN from my doc that the paper and painting had been done ....................they knew not to tell me Later that night sister calls and says mom is okay and resting so for me to rest I told her I had some Major things to talk about with her she justs stayed quiet I hung up a knawing feeling kept coming and going I must have finally fell asleep for at 6:05 am on Monday March 20th mom was GONE...........

 Isolation...........Lonliness Some ppl that are the sole caregivers of their loved one albeit wife, husband, mother, or father will at one point feel isolated and lonely. The Isolation will or can stem from being the only one caring for loved one ..friends disappear at most times and so do alot of family members. You are looking after your loved one 24/7 and are consumed with thier aspect of care in EVERY way ......it can be at times very lonely. Try to involve your family members tell them that: "" Grandma or Grandpa or Mom / Dad have a disease they cannot help and they still need the love from ALL that loved them prior to this illness "" Most times in my opinion this stems from Ignorance of Alzheimers have them read up if they will and find out what their loved one is going thru You as the sole Caregiver Have to have some down time and not just when they are sleeping you are kinda like a "" soldier on watch"" even when they seem to be sleeping peacefully most times you do not ,waiting for that lil noise or movement letting you know they are awake and need attention. Do not feel guilty if you have a person from Homecare come in so you can go out and have a couple of hours to self you really need to Re group and get your self some time where you are able to talk to others and see what is going on in our world Yes it is the greatest thing you can do Caring for those you LOVE but you do need a break once in awhile. A bit of the time I feel the total isolation when no one comes about for Dad and I nor did they for Mom and us. Tell your daughters /sons /grandchildren it is okay she / he is still in there and needs all the love and understanding ...SO DO YOU. Seniors are the Backbone of our SOCIETY and should be treated as the great ppl they are and given plenty of credit for what they have given to the world. If not for them where would we be. I really use to get upset over no one coming round but now I see it like this I cannot force them and perhaps they dont have that "" connection"" I do or ability I was given by HIM to do what I do. not everyone is cut out to do this. DO NOT isolate yourself as it will be all the harder to get back into the swing of the outside world and whatnot when the time comes for them to be called home If you are depressed lonely and NEED to cry for what could have been and the what ifs ......DO SO there is no shame in emotions and TEARS. When Mom passed I went into a deep depression and it scared me I am coming out of this by having mentors like Grampa Padraig and others to help me thru WE ALL NEED A BIT OF HELP.....no matter how strong we are or put forward we are we do need the help .....do not be ashamed to ask for it .nor let stubborness get in the way. ..This forum and the ppl are fantastic and Padraigs story shows what day to day caring is all about .... Take the time to read it if you choose I am sure it will hit home with many things he has posted and gone thru I wish all of you only love ,happiness and peace of mind that YES you are doing the right thing by being there for those that need us/you. BUt I do implore all to get some "" time out "" Do not be isolated and lonely ........thats not what your loved ones would want for you. I think I am pretty safe in saying this. "" God Bless The Caregivers "" LYN


 Decided since we have a few new members now that are dealing with their loved ones living with them I would post some of what may be feeling or going thru and what you may expect or what you can do to help or find another solution........... If Your Parent Lives With You and has Alzheimers Sometimes there is your parent living with you and if you are married you may go thru many hurdles because of it ...the sexual aspect of your marriage can be badly disrupted and this in turn will and can cause other problems in your relationship You may be too tired to make love or you may have stopped going out together on "" dates"" in the evenings so you end up losing the Romance that may have kindled the "" lovemaking"" in the firstplace Your confused parent may be a wanderer and be up and about banging or getting in to things ......could be irritable ....shouting and or aggressive and even knocking on your BD door constantly Relationships are hard enough sometimes but with the added stressors it can be very difficult to keep your marriage intact The relationship should be enriched by all the parts of a open and happy one This includes talking ......facing troubles and financial difficulties together as well as having the intimacy that is so needed at times Strong relationships can and will survive if you put aside some things for a bit but not for too long It is imperative that you find the time and energy for one another ....get someone you trust to come in and go out even if its just to have a cup of coffee or catch a movie ....... Make yourself find different ways and avenues to create the romance and as well as the privacy you need so dearly to keep your mariage happy and healthy......... I was extremely lucky with my hubby he was always there for me and for Mom and we did argue at times which is natural IMHO about losing alot of time together but he also knew just how close I was to Mom and now I am doing the same for DAD but unfortunately Howie and I have split and I and Cait now share the caregiving for Dad........ Take care of you and your spouse as well as your parent and remember that your spouses are dealing with most of what you deal with as well ........ God Bless the Caregiver


 o me I find it very sad if you have a loved one at home and they are able to walk or have a wheelchair ........that they might not get outside and see other ppl and the beauty in the world Yes they are almost non aware of many things BUT they do need fresh air they need to be around other ppl and they need to be accepted by others in Community ...... AD is NOT contagious as we all know so if you are able to take your loved one out even to shop I would really suggesst you try it even if its only once to see how it goes ......... They no doubt would sleep better and perhaps their appetite would be better as well They are still able to see the wonders in the world the changes in the world and all of the different things going on Never be embarrassed for doing all of these things for those you care for ....your loved ones I take Dad to Market and I take him around town all the time he loves it especailly yard sales and seeing ppl he remebers a few ....pretends he knows others but I know different as do they BUT they enjoy seeing him as well .......... Remember this is my opinion not something that I am trying to throw down anyones throat .. I just think if possible get them out .........


 Being the sole Caregiver IS a very hard task and with it comes many emotions as we have read ...... You do need to look after yourself just as well or you wont be able to do what is needed for them you love In my opinion Yes the rewards are great for sure Please take care of you too


 Taking care of your health physically and mentally is a must in order to help others properly imho just my opinion luvs lyn


 HI and welcome I too worked in the field actually owned my own retirement home and most of my family worked there as well as hubby at the time Dad cooked in kitchen Mom was Office and assisstant Admin for me I was the owner and Admin BUT I changed and did everything that I expected the staff to do as well IN our staff room I had put up a huge piece of Bristol board that read 1...All residents to be treated with respect and dignity 2...Remember that EMPATHY is NEEDED and Given FREELY 3...Love each one differently just as each one is different 4..Family is what this HOME is all about I was never so devasted when my health went right down and Mom got Alzheimers at the time too so I had to sell home I can still remember ppls names ...birthdays ,likes and dislikes ect I honestly wish I was still able to be doing this it really is hard to not do what you love best THat is why I am on HW so much trying to reach out and give back some of all I have been given over the yrs ...... YOUR post is right on you are definitely one that is a true loving person with them at heart I thank you for that Please do stay with us I am sure you have much input and info to help as well Glad to have you aboard ........and in ""our lil family"". LYN


 On the other hand, it's rerwarding to be a caregiver too. It gives you fulfillment and happiness. It gives you inner joy if you share your feelings with them, make life worthwile, and maintain their independence in their small ways. This feeling of joy is priceless. And the reward that God is giving me, I'm still able and independent for 16 years that I'm sick of Parkinson""s Disease. Thanks for the opportunity of sharing.


 Many outsiders think that because ""our loved ones"" have that BLANK look that they are not there and do not need any kind of COMMUNICATION.......... IMHO.....that is totallly NOT so .......... They need touch they need to be talked too and they also need to feel the person's love AS well never think that THEY do not feel the vibes coming from you as they really do and they take it all in causing more confusion and anxiety.....IMHO Give them the love caring and unending devotion they REALLY need and soooo deserve You will be the Richer for it .................Just my half penny worth today Luvs God Bless LYN


 HI there and WELCOME I too have worked in NH's and I owned a Retirement home that I ran with almost all my family members.....

Any Advice on Aricept?,"HI... my mother is taking Aricept. I've done some generic research online about it, but I was wondering if anybody that is familair with it, can give me their thoughts on it. Should you take it with food or on empty stomach? Have you noticed any side effects? Any insight would be appreciated.",HI there I have known many on this med and it is a good med for some ppl If memory serves me right It should be taken with a light breakfast Even a pice of toast or bread Oatmeal would be great and a fine source of fibre Your bat bet about the side effects would to be contact RX doc / or pharmacy I am so happy you found us here at HW and Do hope you plan on sticking with us ...........LYNr
Vacations,"During the summer before I put my gma in an assisted living center, we would take her with us to my in laws cottage on the river. It got to the point that we couldn't take her with us anymore because she was wandering around, which was not safe due to uneven ground, and going up and down the stairs to the dock by herself. My gma is almost blind so that didn't help things. Before she was placed in the home, she was not on medication for her dementia and would lock herself in her room at the cottage and she would get scared because she couldn't find her way out. Both me and my MIL had to ""rescue"" her on several occasions. So now comes the dilema. Since she has started Namenda, she has got much better though she is not there completely yet. She has some lucid moments. So I took her to lunch today and she asked if I could take her to the cottage in the summer for a few days. Normally this wouldn't bother me but the problem is that when we go to the cottage, it's not just us. We have other family members that go. Sometimes there is close to 10-15 of us there at a given time in a small 900sq ft house with one bathroom. Us younger ones can make do with that but my gma is having alot of bowel issues in addition to her urine issues as well. I don't feel it's fair to my inlaws to also to the get the brunt of my gma's dementia episodes. She doesn't listen to anyone but me and if she doesn't like what others tell her, she ""hunts"" me out to ""tattle"" on them. So in short, I don't feel that the cottage is the right place to take Gma to now. But how do I explain things to her in a way that she can understand? Are there any other alternatives that you see that may be possible?","Red I am also kinda at a loss but I would plain out just tell her maybe next time ........that there wil perhaps be more ppl there than usual and you NEED the time to regropup with yourself and your daughter I am not trying to sound mean hun but I really believe you do need this time without the issues she is dealing with that then fall on you I hope you have a great time LUVS LYN


 i wish i had advice for you....i will keep you in my thoughts and prayers and if i think of an intelligent suggestion i willl let you know........"
"Reality, fantasy or memories?","I sometimes get weird phone calls from my gma or she will tell me something totally off the wall. But how can you tell what is real and what isn't?? For instance, she said that some guy was trying to get into her room the other day and it scared her to death because he was on a motorcycle. Now that in itself sounds strange of course considering that she has a room that is on the inside of the building. But it's like trying to decipher what she is saying because to her a wheelchair is a bicycle. So I'm thinking the motorcycle could be another way of her saying it was a wheelchair as well. She is very paranoid and constantly locks her door and has even locked herself out on occasion. She has even told me that they don't feed her there and even called up her best friend (from another state) and said they don't feed her. I KNOW they feed her but trying to tell her that in the evening they don't give her as much because she has severe intestinal issues that too much food will cause her to have diarrhea all night. All your life you are taught to listen to your elders and it is so hard to NOT to listen to some of the strange things she tells me without getting wrapped up in it. Sorry this post is little all over the place today. I'm not feeling very well but I just wanted to ask - how can you tell what is fantasy, memory or reality?","Red I so agree with Rosie It is hard to tell what is real and what is not unless you are there I think though it probably is a wheelchair she may be talking about Would she write things down if you asked her Can you when you are there next time see if perhaps someone does go up and down the hallway in a w/c I know at the homes I worked in many did wander in and out of others rooms We tried to stop it as much as possible but it still happened........... Honestly and this is me I believe that some of what they say ( unless way way out there) has some truths to it Its kinda like putting a puzzle together without the last piece at times I do feel your pain and the frustration of not knowing for sure keep us posted Please LYN


 Keah I hope your Aunt does have improvement with this med My dad did good on it for quite some time........ Keep us posted and know we do understand LYN


 Keah, my gma is the same way. When she lived with me, she would constantly hide things and then blame others for moving them. Especially my daughter. She was always blaming things on my daughter for some reason but my son could never do no wrong. That in itself was another reason I had to move her out to an assisted living center. My daughter was having major issues and I do believe it was due to the stress of my gma living with us. Since I moved her out, my daughter has finally started to behave and act like a normal teen again. But I just wanted to say that it can be tough to deal with a person with AZ, even if they don't live with you. It's so sad to see them like this - it truly breaks my heart. Rosie, I wished I could have my gma write things down but she is almost blind from macular degeneration. Lyn, I know that some of the residents do go in and out of my gma's room which is one of the reasons she locks her door all the time. It's frustrating for my gma because she thinks these people are coming in to steal things even though she doesn't have anything of value in her room. But the paranoia is still there.


 Hi Red, Your right it IS hard to tell. The motorcycle could be someone coming into her room with cart on wheels. My dad was telling a story about ""remember when we went to the hospital and you go downstairs to the big refrigerator?"" Everyone in the room looked at each other like he was nuts . . . but I looked at him and said ""yes . . . the morgue"" . . . Dad used to own an ambulance service and they would go to the morgue at the hospital to pick up folks who had passed-on and take them to the funeral home. So he was just chatting about the old days. I understand your concern because when you are talking to gma on the phone there is more guilt involved. You feel like she might need you there. I used to ask Dad if he had a pen. If your gma still uses pen and paper (even if she loses it), ask her if she has a pen. She'll go get pen and paper . . . and then you have her write down the time and day you'll visit next. Someone giving them a task to do (even as simple as writing a simple note) will get their mind off the obsession. I'm not even sure Dad wrote anything down . . . he just felt like I thought he was still normal enough to take some notes. It seemed to give him a bit of confidence. I'm so sorry your gma has this dd. It is so hard to watch them decline. Hugs, prayers, and . . . Blessings!


 Sometimes it really is impossible to tell the difference. Like Lyn, I also agree that there is some basis of reality in whatever they say, but the end story that comes out can be really off base, especially if there is the element of paranoia involved. My Aunt cannot accept that she is having such memory problems and so she has decided that someone is coming in and moving her things and/or thowing them out. When we got it down to where there was absolutely nobody in the family to blame, she decided that the tenant upstairs must be sneaking in at night while she slept and moving her papers. To solve that problem, we added a security chain to the door. Now nobody can get in once she locks it, but still, the next week, she got me up on a chair checking the tops of her closets for a hole that he could climb through! I know how frustrating it is when I forget something and just can't imagine how difficult and scary it must be to be in my Aunt's position. Almost 90, almost blind and all alone with your belongings constantly shifting places because you can't remember moving them. How awful! So anyway, the reality for my Aunt is that her things do move from place to place and then the fantasy comes in to protect herself and the mover has got to be someone else because she doesn't remember moving it. We did get her a script for Aricept about a month ago, but she was reluctant to take it because she's been lucky enough to notneed any other medications besides eye drops for her Glaucoma and Macular Degeneration. After weeks of me trying she finally starting taking it last week. I hope that this can help her some and that there is some improvement soon.


 (((((((( Keah )))))))) I'm so sorry to learn that your Aunt is afflicted with this dd too. God bless you as you learn the ins and outs of caring for an alz patient. I know it is a hard road . . . I hope you have some help. Let us know how things go with the med. Blessings!

 it's morning now. i still feal sad. i tried to talk to hubby about it. he said i should be happy and glad that she's not suffering. and that she's still alive. i am glad and happy she's still alive. i just hate this disease. i've watched my momma disappear. he hasn't. i've watched the confusion on her face so many times about simple things. yes, she's alive and seems to be happy. so why do i leave that nursing home so sad? i can't be happy she has this disease. sorry i'm ranting. hubby just doesn't understand i guess. maybe i'm grieving i don't know. i pray at night sometimes that momma isen't scared. you know how young kids get scared. i don't want her to be scared or cry. hubby says all this is part of life you live then you die. he's not much help is he? i'm going to see momma again this morning. thanks for listening.


 oh i forgot. momma knew my name today.


 i tried to write on my other post but it wouldn't let me. i'm just checking in to tell yaw we had Thanksgiving Dinner last night at the nursing home. momma loved it. she had a wonderful time. it was so wonderful almost like she was her old self. she even used her fork threw the whole meal. i'm so proud. thanks for listening. sorry i had to make another topic.


 well i had to grip again at the nursing home yesterday. i know they must hate me. but i am not going to let them treat momma any old way. at lunch they didn't give her plate to her till last. it was fish day. she didn't get any fish. i understand that she gets her plate last cause she has to be fed. i was there i was going to feed her. well they sent out these burnt pop corn shrimp, hard biscuit, baked potatoe, letuce, choclate brownie and milk. that's all. everybody else had fish and tea also and pie. momma got scrapes. oh they got shrimp to. so momma tried to eat her biscuit, and potatoe. i took the rest to the head lady and gripped. asked her if she'd aet that crap. she took it to the kitchen but never brought nothing else back. they're having a meeting the 6th up there, i'm going and grip again. it's not fair just because momma eats last she should get left overs. i want have it. thanks for listening.


 Hello Tiny, Tomorrow is the 6th. I hope you go to the meeting and stay assertive and advocate for your Mom. No one should be fed any kind of food that is inedible. Your Mother is so lucky to have you to speak for her. So many are not that lucky. I will be here supporting you tomorrow in your quest for decent food. You go girl. Kitt


 hi yaw, thank you for caring lyn and kitt. well i went to the meeting and they said that the food thing would be took care of. they fixed her walker because she lost hers and was using one that made her bend over to much. she also just lost her glasses so they're getting her some new ones. i was nervious in there. but said what i needed to say. and it went real good. better than i thought. i had wanted my sister to go with me. but she couldn't because she had to go to the doctor. i have bipolar and anxity. so you know i was a little nervious lol. but everything went great. thanks again for listening.


 i just wanted to give an update on momma. she's been at herself a good bit lately. my brother is coming for Christmas so i'm hoping she'll know him. i hope all of yaw have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.


 well my brother came for Christmas. momma knew him some, then she didn't. i guess that's how it is. i haven't had to grip much. yesterday i had to remind them to take her to the potty. she was soked when i popped in at lunch time. i take her when i'm there. but they're suppose to every 2 hours. i pop in at different times. that way they can't be on gaurd for me lol. well she had a bad day yesterday to. very confused. i left sad. thanks for listening.


 lyn, sorry about your Dad having a bad day. well, i missed going to see momma yesterday. i went this morning. she has a bruise above her eye and her cheek is swollen. nobody seems to know what happen. she couldn't have got up by herself. anyways waiting on exrays to make sure all is fine. i'm going to find out what shift this happen on. they just didn't write it down. or call me or my sister. thanks for listening.


 well, i asked everybody i could. nobobody seems to know anything. the bruise is about gone and the swelling is gone. i'm waiting for exrays. i'm sure there fine. i guess i'll never know how she fell. if this and hopefully it will never happen again, happens i'm going to raise more sand. it's a real nice nursing home. i don't understand. thank you for being here for me lyn.


 hi lyn, well my momma fell again. it wasn't bad. she was trying to use the bathroom in in wastebasket and sat down off it. i think that happens cause back in the old days they didn't have bathrooms. she's ok though. still can't keep up with her glasses. she has 2 pairs. can only find 1. i ask about them every day. i know they get tired of hearing about them. i don't care. they cost money. hope your doing fine lyn. thank you.


 i just wanted to let yaw know that my momma is fine. well she has good days and bad ones. seems like she's been having alot of good ones. oh, she still can't eat byherself and stuff like that. but she seems happy. she's in the last stages i guess. but i always ask her before i leave, momma what's my name? she always says elaine, i could never forget you. then i leave and cry. cause one day she may forget our little game. i know she doesn't know me all the time. but she remembers that little game i play with her about my name. thanks for listening.


 well, that day came when she no longer remembers our game. today she couldn't even remember who i was. i think she knew i was someone that loved her. but that's all. i stayed 3 hours. fed her breakfast. when i got there they were letting her do it. and she couldn't. her eggs were cold. i told them to bring her some more and they should eat that. i've been sad since i left the home. crying. i hate this disease. i'll be strong and keep loving momma of course. but my heart breaks. she is so sweet and innocent. i love her so much. i guess i'll deal with this not knowing my name somehow. i've known for awhile now that she slips in and out of knowing me. but she always got my name right. thanks for listening.


 well, the food thing with momma was worse than i thought. my sister called and told me this morning that nobody was feading her at lunch yesterday ethier. and it was sitting in front of her cold. so this morning i showed up there and the same thing was happening. except momma was eating her oatmeal, but not very good. i took that plate to the head man. and asked him if he'd eat it. the bread was so hard you could have broke a window. when i asked the nurse the day before for another egg, she said no the kitchen was closed. so they just heated the one she had up and gave her a fresh biscuit. i told that man all this. my momma is a diabitic. she has to eat. the day before that nurse told me she isn't losing any wieght is she? i was so mad this morning. that man said he was going to watch the next couple of days and make sure she gets fed. she better. i'll be back lol. thanks for listening.


 THAT is so great I am so happy for you and for her as well it sure makes the heart swell doesnt it Luvs LYN"
New to this room but in the Crones disease room,"My grandmother just passed away. I flew back the next day because my mother was taking care of her. All of the sudden I realize and am told, that mom is in the first stages of tAlzeheimers. I see it it now. i am out of state and she wants to stay in her home that her father built. She calls me time after time, sometimes 9 times in a row, to repeat what she just said. I know that I need to go and take care of her and the home but yet, she doesn't want to leave. How can I take her away from what she has always known? And the worst part is, I am in gaming. Every person that I see that is older than70, I wonder ""why my mother?""....Will this happen to me? Thanks..Just wanted to vent...Just hating life.....","Hi tia; I came when my Dad called me for help with my stepmother, who has kidney disease, two xmas's ago. I knew my Dad was repeating himself a lot but I didn't make the connection. He and she were very isolated and I just thought maybe he didn't have a lot of news to talk about , so, he was telling the same story over and over. Once I was here, I realised, he had dementia, most likely Alzheimers because his mother passed away from it merely 5 years previously. I was very hands on in her care so it was easy to spot. I don't know if I knew then what I know now, about giving my life over to care for a parent with Alzheimers, that I would have. I am in it now, up to my eyeballs, none of the other sibs want anything to do with us, or caring for my Dad and I'm stuck. It is making me ill. The stress is unbelievable. I was a single mom, raised two boys in a rough part of town, have several stress related illnesses, worked three jobs, one fulltime , two part time, almost lost my youngest to gang activity and am in worse condition now, here, trying to look after my Dad, Stage II Alzheimers, than any other time in my life. I have been homeless, lived out of my car. Worked the dirtiest of all jobs, recycling plants, sorting garbage, cleaning toilets in the park, I'm sorry, that was hard, but there was an end in sight. No end in sight here. No support from family. Total isolation. Constant stress. Negativity galore. Think about it before you do it. The person I am now caring for is not my Dad. I don't know where my Dad went and who this miserable, mean, vindictive person is. I am stuck. Short of taking him to an emergency room and refusing to take him home again, is the only way out. I can't do that. I don't know what to do. My children, now grown and doing well, say, mom, yes, putting him in a nursing home may shorten his life. But is it worth losing your life over? Think.


 Tiamaria Just wondering how you are making out Have you read threads I bumped up for you ?? Be well and post plz and let us know how things are going You are family here on HW Luvs LYN


 So right all relationships are different and so are our loved ones with this DD Thanks for posting and keeping us in the loop Plz do continue to do so Take care LYN

 tiamarie It is NOT a punishment for you I am so sorry you feel this way I have alot of anger but I am trying to work thru it THIS darn disease that robs us of our loved ones really is a spiteful and GREEDY disease I wish you all the best Know we are here for you if thats any help k ,,,,,,,,,,,,LYN


 HI Tia I know you from CD forum I am so sorry about your GMA I have lost both Mom and dad in the last 2 yrs to this DD I despise it so There some risks involved but you would need to go have an appointment with a Geneaologist I have high doubts this will be your end my friend I know it is hard when your parent has it believe me 'I looked after both mine I will bump up some threads for you okay and if you need to talk email me LYN


 .NO one but you my friend can tell you the right thing to do It is so hard when your parents change from day to day I know all to well I know you are exhausted and feel alone WE are here for support at all times Its a hard but I found it a ""gift"" actually to spend the time with them I had Cait to spell me off at times too Dad did not develop the AD or stages till about a yr after Mom passed and he was full of cancer as well I truly miss them both ........... Take care and keep us posted plz LYN


 I realise every relationship is different. I might have een being a bit oveprotective. I have a friend with Crones, and several aquaintances and know how debilitating that disease is. However, I also realise every Alzheimer's patient is different, my Gramma was delightful, right up until the end, she was like a little girl dancing around with her ""baby""a little doll, a joy to care for. My Dad however fights me every step of the way. Every little change that happens somehow ends up with us 'locking horns""and when he gets his horns out, lookout, It's scarey. I should not tell others what to do.


 Thanks everyone. I drove to Colorado to see her last week. She was so excited to show me that the house was clean and that she had groceries. Almost like she was trying to pass a test. So child like and so fun. I took her to the mountains and she loved it!!!! I just don't want her to forget her family.


 tyno3 It's very hard isn't it? Don't you just get angry and hate life? I have certainly paid my dues and to have to watch a parent go through this is the ultimate punishment. I don't know if I am angry, hurt or confused. I don't even know whether it is my mothers punishment or mine. It can't be hers because she is always so kind and caring. Me, on the other hand, maybe through some of the crappy choices I made in my life, it is mine. I just hate it."

 Tiny, I am so sorry and I do know the loss of a parent. It leaves you feeling so alone. Let us hug you now and know you can come here and talk about momma whenever you choose. There's magic in a Momma's touch, And sunshine in her smile. There's love in everything she does To make our lives worthwhile. We can find both hope and courage Just by looking in her eyes. Her laughter is a source of joy, Her works are warm and wise. There is a kindness and compassion To be found in her embrace, And we see the light of heaven Shining from our Momma's face . In Loving Friendship Kitt


 Tiny, I am so sorry for your loss. I am sorry that I have not been on here in a while. I will be thinking of you.. Dorseys daughter


 You would be great at volunteering BUT I honestly think you need to get self at a good place first sweetie I know how those tears fall I still let them come for mom and more and more for Dad This DD is a real stealer of our loved ones I do despise it so ...

YOU WILL BE SUPPORTED THRU ALL OF THIS Love lyn


 thank you rosie. yesterday momma had been gone a week. it's been a long week. thank you lyn for always being here for me."
Did I mention how much I HATE Alzheimers???!!!,"I sooooo hate this disease!! It is so unfair to everyone involved! I miss my gma - the one that was. I get a lot of weird phone calls from her and I expect this. But yesterday I got a call from her because she was worried about me. She was crying and she was trying to tell me something so I had to tell her to stop crying since I can't understand her. So she calmed down to tell me that she hasn't seen me in 2 months and she was worried about me. I was there last Wednesday and spent 45 minutes talking with her and I had to remind her of that. She said, ""Well I must not have been here then."" I also had to remind her that I told her that I was picking her up on Monday to take her to lunch and back to my house to get some warmer clothes. She then perked up and said ok. But what I hate is that I go there 2 or 3 times a week and spend an hour with her each time and she has no recollection of me being there. I even write down in large black letters on a writing tablet what day I was there and when I am coming back. I am trying to keep it together but agh! I just HATE Alzheimers! Sorry for the vent - this just saddens me to no end.","I sure despise this DD as well More than you know I did the same as Rosie would write lil notes but sometimes to no avail I am so sorry you are going thru this Luvs LYN


 Red' There is NO other DD I think that can take the ones you love and literally rip them apart leaving ""bits n pieces"" I believe even though she acts like she doesnt know you are there SOMEWHERE in her is a lil tad of something that may just come to her when you are not around ya know what I mean I am with you all the way I really DO despise this darned disease


 ((((((((( Sherry ))))))))))))) I hear you sis. I used to leave notes for my dad. I'd write out a little note and he'd put it in his wallet and take it out and put it back and take it out and put it back. Sometimes, when he'd talk like your gma about how long it had been . . . I'd just write out my name and phone number and tell him he could call me any time. And he did. I didn't even try to explain that I'd just been there. I'd answer the phone and sound REALLY excited and ""HELLO!! I'M SO GLAD YOU CALLED!! HOW HAVE YOU BEEN??? I CAN'T WAIT TO VISIT YOU AGAIN!! WOULD MONDAY BE GOOD FOR YOU?"" With that, you could just hear his smile. He could then enjoy thinking about Monday . . . until he forgot again. LOL I know its really hard, but you are going to look back and think how good she's actually doing right now. . . so don't allow the frustration to use up your energy . . . turn it right back around into something positive. Deep in her spirit . . . she KNOWS you love her. You are doing a great thing for her. Hugs, prayers, hot tea, and . . Blessings!


 I hate it. My mother calls me, sometimes 9-12 times within an hour. I try not to get fustrated because, how scared is she? Mom knows what she has and yet keeps trying to prove herself to me. She knows that one day, she will not know me. Nor her family. She keeps repeating to me, how many people have the disease and what is being done to help them. She won't admit it but I know that she is terrified. I can see it in her eyes. This is what makes me think what a cruel world it is."
Something Wrong?,"I wrote a post about how members might be able to assist me in getting my Dad to agree to accept his lifestyle as a tractor driving farmer has run it's course. Everytime I bring up the topic of selling the tractor to cover some bills outstanding in our little town, he gets really cranky. I have tried everything to cut costs and still can't make ends meet. Our only hope is to sell first the tractor, plow, and cultivator, ASAP, then in the new year, the farm, because I can't live there (black mould), and as my siblings won't assist in anyway, either hands on or by assisting financially. I have tried to cut everything to cut costs, got rid of expensive vehicle, bought a little 11 year old car I can do a lot of the maintenance on myself, totally paid for, no extras, no cable TV, no going out to eat, no movies, nothing that isn't absolutely necessary. I still have to rely on credit from local merchants, and that's beginning to get old. Now, the head honcho's take off when they see me coming. I've been questioned sternly about exactly when bills will get paid. My debit card was revoked at the local bank. It's terribly humiliating. Dad no longer uses the tractor but gets very angry when I suggest we must sell it. this siyuation is very unpleasant, is causing me terrible stress, something I need to avoid. How do I get Dad to see I need to do this in order to keep going?","I will have to take it in hand, do the minor repairs it needs and sell it, anyway. I have already spoken to a neighbor over near the old farmhouse who knows everybody in this area, and we've found a price which he feels is attainable. I've offered him an incentive to do the leg work as I don't know to many of the farmers here. I think that has to be the only course. Thank-you red 34.


 I am pretty sure he will notice. He seems obsessed with the tractor. I think this is because he has lost his drivers license and this is the last thing he has that ties him to who he is/was. My stepmother has explained to him several times that where we are now, and where we'll be going there won't be anywhere to keep the tractor. I may try to look at every other possibility to raise the funds we need to keep going, but ultimately, it will have to go. I don't know if it's even safe for him to be driving it. So, it's a conundrum. Ultimetely it's in my hands as the other two sibs are totallly out of touch with dad and his needs. Sister is in denial, brother is way unrealistic. Brother suggested Dad come live with him in New York but Dad's wife is here, in nursing home and he needs to see her a couple times a week. Also, both my brother and his wife work, so who will care for Dad 24 hours a day. Finally, Dad would not be covered by Medicare or Pharmacare, in New York so who will pay for doctor's, medicine. Then there is the language Brother used ""what it he were made to come"". I simply explained to brother that Dad has bowel incontinence and that was the end of the ficticious.wrenching power away from me, over Dad's care, foolishness.


 i spoke to the dentleman handling the sale by telephone. He says he'll be ovver tomorrow with two interested in the tractor. Although i spoke with on my cell phone in my gedroom becsuse, from that moment untill now, Dad is andry at me and says ït'll never work, him and i living together.That was right around supper time and he just moved his spaghetti around on his plate, didn;t eat at all. When I asked he mumbled there's to much ffghting between us.He says i have sumeuned reaj


 Partly because of the two teeyh in my mouth which are driving me crazy, saying it feels like root canals might be needed and I told him I needed a little extra money for that. He seemed to understand. Sofar, so good. It will be a day by day thing though, for a while. Thank-you all. Post Edited By Moderator (Red_34) : 11/9/2008 6:38:52 AM (GMT-7)


 Is this Nathanbr a new member Tyno Introduce us and welcome LYN


 You may NOT be able to get him to see reason and that is sad unfortunately. I'm just wondering - and this is really sneaky and may not even be a good solution - but what if you were to sell it without him knowing it? If you have POA then you have that right. I personally wouldn't feel right doing it but if the circumstances are dire then you may have no choice. Would he even know it was missing?


 That just may be your ONLY option'I do hope you will keep us posted Take care and I am so sorry things are going so badly for you's .....LYN


 I really think YOU have hit the nail on the head Mom it was her Roses Dad his garden and prize Zuccinnnis It seems they have ONE thing they hold onto for dear life They have really lost just almost everything else SAD isnt it...and why I despise this DD so much I do hope it will come to be where he might see the benefits.......... Keep us posted LYN


 Wel the kind neighbor who is helping us sell the tractor, came by today. Apparently, he has two interested parties, inquiring after it. I did the important repair, reattaching a battery cabel wire, so the Tractor would start. \\\\\\\\\\\\\it sure did. It was running great when our neighbor showed up. He reved it a bit and didn;t see black smoke coming out of exhaust so he said it wasn't burning oil, a good thing I guess. After an initial temper tanyrum, Dad fell into step with me and seems to be letting go of the tractor. Partly because of the two teeyh in my mouth which are driving me crazy, saying it feels like root canals might be needed and I told him I needed a little extra money for that. He seemed to understand. Sofar, so good. It will be a day by day thing though, for a while. Thank-you all.


 Nathanbr, didn't write the bit below, whoever that may be. I wrote it. Thank-you.


 Well, the tractor sold and the funds allowed us to pay down some of the debt load left behind by Stepmom, when she went into nursing home. She (and my Dad somehow signed his name to it) have a 13,000 credit card debt. She is refusing to pay any of it. The collection agency is calling me, making threats. Dad only gets about !!00 per month and all oof that goes to mortgage on old farmhouse, dear old stepmom took out a second mortgage, to facilitate freeing up funds to gamble. There was a tremendous backlash from my Dad last Friday night, he kicked my bedroom door in, police had to be called. I am going to start a new thread about how to handle the aggression."
Aggression Management,"What tools do caregivers have that will curtail aggression before it becomes dangerous? My Dad does get a mild sedative before bedtime but on a half dozen or so occasions, the yelling, pushing, and threatening have escalated to the point where I either had to leave for a bit or call in reinforcements; a neighbor, the police and my son. The doctor is away, so i asked the pharmacist, who replied. ""make an appt, with doctor, sometimes antipsychotics are used."" Anyone know what has been usefull, and what is just been more troublesome.","Hi Rosie, and all you good folk. It seems the argumentative behavior starts around 5:30, through 9:30 PM. A simple question will set him off. Tonight I asked if he wanted to spend the morning with his wife, at the nursing home (b/c I have to get winter tires on, and he hates to wait). Well, you would have thought I'd asked him if he wanted to go ballroom dancing. He shot back with ""that's an awful thing to ask a guy, I hate waiting around, you know that,"" and on and on and on. Gosh it takes a lot of patience to deal with this fellow at this stage. So, before I do anything tomorrow, I'm going to make him a doctor's appointment. It will probably take a week or so to get in. They're always swamped. Also, I have to get him on the Alzheimer's registry. I'll let you know how the medical check-up works out.


 Thanks sis You pop in anytime 'Your input is always spot on and very welcomed Thanks .......Luvs ya ....... Tyno Rosie is spot on Sundowning it is called and I am thinking too your dad is having it last for a longer than the ""norm"" time I would hope they could get him into doc alot earlier than that Can you trell them it is definitely a safety issue for you and for your dad see where that gets you Please do keep us posted LYN


 I am sure you will get some answers tyno I am bringing up a thread for you okay on Sundowning Either tonight or tomorrow Lyn


 ((((( tyno ))))) My dad did start getting aggressive toward the end. We managed to get by with a sharp ""HEY!"". He seemed to understand and it would ""break his concentration on the anger"". I found that using that one word wasn't disrespectful . . . it didn't cause more aggression . . . and it was perfectly abrupt to halt him. Having said that . . . I think the doctor appointment is absolutely in order. I'm sorry I don't know about the meds. The ones they used in the hospital simply kept him ""out of it"". I hope the doc can help you. I know that is really scary sometimes. Would you post and let us know what helps or what doesn't help? Blessings!


 Sorry Tyno . . . this behavior at that time of day is called ""sundowning"". There is something about that time of day that really does make them agitated sometimes. But I'm sorry it last SO long in your case. Does he take ginko? Mom started giving dad Ginko Biloba and it seemed to help him a bit. I've seen others on this site talk about it too. Not sure it will help at this point. Keep us posted. I know I'm out of the Alzheimer's issues, but I do peek in this forum once in a while to see if I can encourage anyone. God love you Tyno! You are a really special person. Blessings!


 Will do. Thanks Rosie and Lyn. I'll tell them about the sundowning and that it went on for quite a while, and I'm scared. See where that gets me."
When You're Alone,"I am sole caregiver for my 73 year old Dad who has Alzheimers. He gets really confused about stuff, we begin talking about his tractor, which I'm trying to sell because we're way behind on our bills and where we live now, and where we're going, come spring, there will be no need for, or space for the tractor. So here we are discussing the tractor, and all of a sudden we're talking about a piece of land, just up the road from here, belonging to myself and three sibs, who are less than helpful. So, today and yesterday, I've had the toothache that is so painful it's making me nauseous. From my bed it's eight feet to the BR. Last night I was crawling on my hands and knees, because the pain was so awful I was dizzy and disorientated. This morning I got up long enough to hear my Dad giving hell to our neighbor who understands our problem, and is trying to help me by finding buyers for the tractor. My Dad was informing him (the neighbor) that it was his property and he'd decide what's going to be done with it. However, what he was talking about was the land owned by the four sibs. So, I spoke with the neighbor and he says he'll talk to us tomorrow. For heavens sake it's a forty two years old tractor which needs new rubber on the hugh back wheels, has two leakes in the fuel take, and frankly, I don't think there's ant paperwork on it. So, lets get to the point, shall we: I am stuck in my bedroom scared to venture out. My Dad is perched on a chair staring at the million Dollar view out the hugh living room window, we're on about 1.5 acres of grass with beautiful stately trees. He's complaining of not having anything to do. I'm ill. I can't sit there and hold his hand, I need a rescuer. There isn't anybody available. I'm trying to pull myself together enough to go get him a rake and some clear lawn bags, so he can rake leaves. I've given him crossword puzzles in large print, really short and easy puzzles, he won't even try. I've made simple cuts to a piece of wood that if fit together, would net a birdhouse. He can go downstairs and hammer to his heart's content. I give up. Uncle","Thank-you, for your kind response. I just woke up, again because the dogs need attention. I'm going to get moving and see what I can get done before my toothache knows I'm up. The problem with getting some real help in, is when I talk to the Community Services, Dept. that is in charge of all that they tell me my Dad isn't supposed to be living here because I'm on disability,and that since we'll be moving again in spring, there's no point in putting services in, until we're settled someplace. I don't know where we'll be going come spring. I know I can't go back to the old place, it made me ill (blk. mould). I'm between a rock and the deep blue sea, that's me.I'll just have to focus on the 1.3 acres and the beautiful view outside my window.


 Just wondering how you are making out sweetie It is a hard but rewarding road Luvs LYN


 NEVER apologise my friend I am sure glad that the tractor is now not going to be a problem and finances will or hopefully will be better YOU are so right and so is your brother That black mold can and will eventually cause so many many health issues even death I know the neighbor has helped in the past but this is a little more it seems to me He would / should know a roof wont get rid of the mold ..... Or anything else for that matter How did your dad take the tractor sale?? YOU have been going and going like the Everready Rabbit YES it is time to take today and just try to relax........... Keep me posted though k God Bless LYN


 I am behind you 110% YOU do deserve a great Christmas present and I believe that would be it Geesshhhh we just got done Halloween and now Christmas is upon us Keep me posted k LYN

 I am so sorry Surely they can offer RESPITE care for a day so you have some ME time Keep me posted LYN


 Thank-you Lyn. I popped into action (the only real answer to any of life's challenges), thank-heavens there was finally a dentist who pulled that nasty tooth out of my mouth. It came in slivers and before she started, I explained I would not be leaving her office without some pain medicine so I can function, she explained I was running the risk of having a perforated sinus because there were three roots, whatever that means, and if my sinus were perforated I would need serious, immediate surgery. I said, ""just put that needle in there and get pulling.""So out it came minus one little piece of bone that she said wasn't worth digging for. So now I have a moderately sore mouth and not excruicating pain. I'm pleased. Then, the financial crunch was temporarily alleviated by our neighbor who did come through on the buyer for the tractor, after all. I think they (he and his wife) are terrific people. He's a very smart man. Now we can begin to problem solve around what we will do with the white elephant sitting on our property, namely the leaky, cold, mouldy, house full of cats sitting over in the mountains behind us. The neighbor to the other side called and said he'd put a roof on in exchange for another piece of property between he and us. However, as my son in Hazardous waste abatement, informs me that putting a roof on, won't solve the problem because all porous surfaces inside will still be contaminated with mould spores. I can't breathe in that house. When I go in now, I wear a mask. So, away goes tooth and tractor, in comes, what our long term living arrangements will look like. I am the one who has to figure this out. It gives me migraines but I have Zomig (which runs risk of stroke/heart attack). Some days I just need to let it be. Today is Sunday, I'm going to let it be. Thank-you (appologies for longwindedness. )


 Thank-you Lyn: This has been a very busy and stress filled couple of weeks. I'm not sure when I'll be able to settle back into a ""normal"" routine. Christmas is just around the corner and we haven't heard whether brother and family, or sister, or my sons will be participating, ie. staying here with us over the hollidays. If I could have my druthers, I'd like one of them to come and take over for a couple days so I could go hang out with my sons. Get my favorite motel room in the city which now feels like home, and let someone else handle Christmas with dad and his wife in the nursing home. about three days. Next time someone asks me, what do you want for xmas, I'm going to say ""three days off, in a row, and a couple of nights in a motel, near my boys."" Heck with the turkey, I'll buy a can of cranberry sauce, a box of Stuff n such, dressing mix and a couple slices of smoked turkey from the deli. I get into a fairly comfortable bed, watch cable TV and only go and do whatever I want. Who knows, maybe there is a Santa Claus. I'm not sure if I'm out of the crunch yet as my dad's older brother , is having open heart surgery this coming week. We're sitting on the edge of our seats, waiting for that shoe to drop. Then there's the big decision coming about , The Farm. Sell it, or not. You are right as is my son about the poisonous Blk. mould. You can't wish it away. The house would need to be stripped down to the concrete foundation, sprayed, then rebuilt, Not worth, i say. There's nothing holding us there except the memories and dad won't even have many of those. There are no particularly fond memories there for me. I almost died there."

"Absolutely Beautiful, Heartwrenching Alzheimer's Tribute","This is my friend Lilly, she lost her stepdad to Alzheimer's. I have truly never seen a more beautiful tribute in my life. She sings the song, too. Please take a look - it will move you and touch your lives. This is for anyone who is going through Alzheimer's with a loved one or has lost a loved one to Alzheimer's. She really understands what it's like to be a caregiver, to lose her parent, and she conveys it beautifully. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVsvi5-noDA","THis is truly well worth looking at IMHO Beautiful and touching...........LYN THanks again for posting the link


 That was sooo Beautiful. GodBless Your Friend for having the courage and strength to put that clip together of her Mom and StepFather. Yes Dementia is a horrible disease that does not prejudice anyone and it takes the real person away leaving you with some one you don't even know and who doesn't know you but all we can do is be with them till the end and always remember who they were and all the Good Times that's what I try to do with my Aunt who I am caring for she is getting worse and worse but we are with her doing the best we can till the end.

Ritualistic behaviors,"Hi Tyno . . . I certainly can't explain ""the behavior"". But my Dad did similar things. He really liked to carry money and we tried to keep him provided with $1 bills. But he started wrapping them in kleenex or napkins and then tearing them and putting them in trash or hiding them that way. So we simply started to give him fake money. . . . because the money still meant so much to him. With food . . . Dad developed a habit of eating EVERYTHING with a fork and knife. Even a hard cookie or an apple. He wouldn't ""touch"" food. You have the added bonus of finding the scraps! Here is my tip. Try really hard to ""enjoy"" him exactly how he is ""today"". He will only continue to deteriorate and as he declines you may look back and say . . . ""I wish I had enjoyed him last month when I 'thought' things were so bad"". This way . . . you won't spend your last weeks/months in total frustration. I'm sorry things are so difficult for you right now. My Dad did hide lots of things . . . . but the oddest thing was . . . that he would hide pieces of pooh!! We even found some after he died. This disease requires SO much tolerance and patience. I guess you will need to use ""the last"" of things yourself. LOL . . . I promise you won't be able to change this odd behavior. You can only chose to accept it - or be frustrated. Hopefully some of the others will have some good advice for you. Blessings!","I cannot explain neither but I know Mom was so bad for this too I really wish I could have gotten totally into her head to know what was going on at times ya know LYN


 Wow tyno . . . You really have it from all directions. YES! I understand all the stress that all of those issues would bring. *sigh* And then, just dealing with the Alz is really a handful all in itself. I hope you'll contact your local Alzheimer's Association. Sometimes they are really good at identifying some help for the caretaker. You really need some relief on a regular basis. . . even if its brief. If you can't find any help through the local Alz Assoc. . . . maybe some folks from church would be willing to help. Its amazing how many people will help if they know your needs. (((((((((( tyno )))))))))))) Big hugs to you!! YES! the little phrase in my signature IS really helpful in hard times. Sending you a hot cup of tea. If you don't enjoy hot tea or coffee . . . try making a hot cup of water. Sounds gross . . . but even holding the hot cup is therapeutic. I've actually taken to drinking my water hot and in a nice mug!! The warmth is like a nice hug . . . even when no one else is around. Glad you found us!! Blessings!


 I believe you do need help from the AD society as well to give you more direction on how to deal wih your dad right now YOu dont want to have to chase him around but hun sometimes thats just what has to be done YOU really need that Christmas present ............EARLY


 I kind of got blindsided into the whole taking care of Dad alone thing. I'd been living away and was summonded to spend a few weeks. Next thing I knew, stepmom was in nursing home, brother moved to Syracuse, sister lives in Vancouver. What started as weeks has turned into years. It's not so bad when you can get professional support, and neighbors try to help. It's just the intensity of it all. Imagin being cooped up, I can get out for about 1 - 2 hours, to bank, grocery shop, etc. Except I have to do it all at triple time speed. Either Dad is sitting in car (with my big dog watching over him,) fussing about how long I'm taking, or he's waiting at home with my cell number pinned to his sleeve. I still run like a mad woman down grocery isles, grabbing and trying to think. Even the checkout girls are running to help. It could make for a very funny movie.


 Hello everyone, My mom has many many quirks. She has been folding the comforter on her bed daily on many occasions for the past year. It never gets old for her. She can do this for up to an hour and be completely drenched in sweat. I will say she does get a workout out of it. She takes tissues in thick bunches and hides them everywhere. If I give her a magazine or newspaper or even a photo album to look at she ends up ripping them to pieces. My mom used to love jewelry and my dad when he was alive would buy her expensive pieces. When she started losing them I put them away in the safe deposit box and bought really cheap knockouts to have her wear in their place. At first she seem to really appreciate these new baubles on her finger but lately she takes it off and puts it in her mouth. The senior center called me this morning while I'm at work to tell me she did just that and they asked me to not have her wear them anymore. My mom has amazing strength if anyone tries to take off her ring. She will not allow it to happen unless it's on her own will. She also does the typical dementia thing of wearing her underwear over her pants or not wearing them at all after she goes to the restroom. Speaking of restroom, she's stuffed a hand towel down her pants before or not wipe at all. She also started to smear lipstick on her cheek and forehead out of boredom. She's even tried to color her greys on her temple area of her scalp with a red lipgloss. I know all these things are not harmful to her with the exception of putting the ring in her mouth but nevertheless it's very draining to see your own mother acting possessed. I have her on Ginkgo 120mg for the last 7 weeks now and I see some slight improvement but none are enough for me. Why have there been so little news lately about research on this? I don't feel like any progress have been made on this humiliating disease since forever. Yesterday while I was going home from work, there was a slight traffic jam on a residential street. I couldn't see what had happened until I got right up to the front. I only noticed lots of onlookers slowing their car to see. Turns out it was a very elderly man was blocking the road by just standing there. His son casually walked to get him and they both slowly walked away. I guess it's not the first time that it's happened because the son looked really calm. My aunts are scared that this will happen to them as well. Funny thing is I don't even think about that happening to me. I guess I think it's just too far off for now. I would appreciate other examples from your family so I won't feel so bad and alone. Thanks!


 Hi, Yes my mom often asks for me with other people and even when she's with me. She's actually looking for the me when I was small. She often thinks something bad has happened to me so she wants me close by. Your grandma is feeling very alone and insecure so that's why she always asks for you because you are the only comforting reminder she has. My mom also have this annoying habit of pulling off her buttons from her shirts. The center has been complaining to me about that and I keep telling them that I always have her wear an undershirt underneath so she won't be exposing herself. They also complained about her wearing slip on sandals in the summer time because she keeps taking them off while she's sitting down and they hate having to put them back on her feet for her. They have threatened to kick her out of the center because they feel she's too much work for them. I want to remind them that times are tough right now and they should be thankful they have a job and that the reason they work there is to help people like my mother. I told myself the day they give a date as to when they want my mom out is the when I will send a complaint letter to the county office about how my mother was unfairly treated and hopefully they will be closed down. I think anyone in my position would feel protective of their loved ones and will do anything to get some justice. I've noticed a lot of doctors do not have sensitivity training when it comes to patients with dementia. Dentists, optometrists, etc. I took my mom to the eye doctor for an eye exam last week and my mom was not very cooperative with keeping her eyes open and what not. They lose their patience and won't try to make it work. The dentist was extremely rude and demanding for her to keep her mouth open and he was constantly talking to his hygienist even though I had asked that he keep the talking to a minimum because my mom gets very confused with constant talking in the background and gets nervous. I finally complained to the office manager and asked for a different dentist the next time around. Like I said earlier. Dementia is a cruel and humiliating disease. One that does not cause any pain to the sufferer but more so for the caretakers.


 ((((((( Lyn )))))))) AND you are such a great roll model for the rest of us. Lyn, you were a gift from God to your parents!! For sure! I'm so glad that you were/are able to share so much with us, here on this forum. Thanks sis!! Blessings!


 Yes it does sound wonderful I do hoper I am alive if this comes to be Lyn


 I love watching House and Grey's Anatomy. They always find a cure for everything and most everyone is saved in the end. Can you think of one disease in real life that can be cured? We don't even have a cure for the common cold. I sometimes wonder if the Pharmaceutical company makes certain that we don't so they can keep selling their drugs to people and causing all kinds of side effects that require more drugs.


 Well, he finally crossed the line. Red 34, your post of 03/11 hit thhe nail on the head. My father came at me yelling, forced his way past me into my room, put his hands on me and told me I better get packing. Only problem is, it's my house. I had to call the RCMP. An officer came, I told him what happened, he went into living room while I stood outside in the rain, and he talked to Dad. Dad had a great time telling him all the houses he built, all about farming and finished off saying I was his daughter, he changed his mind and wasn't going to have me arrested. The only problem is, now I have to sleep with one eye open and one foot out the door. I'm done. Officer said it's escalating and it's only going to get worse. Well, if it gets worse, I may end up physically injured. I feel incredibly defeated. I'm stressed to the max. He is putting my health and well-being at risk. He's not supposed to be living here. That's why services aren't in place. By my having to call the police, there'll be a report going in to Community Services. I'll end up homeless. Why does this happen?


 Dear Bella: I want to clarify. Dad has escalated to physical aggression. His previous Farmhouse was his ""official address"". However, with this escalation in physical aggression, and his seemingly ""rapid decline"", I don't know what configuration our immediate future will take. His wife is in a nearby town, in a nursing home. She says she has approached the Social Work Dept. there at the nursing home to have him ""wait listed"" for a bed, there. Who knows how long that will take. How am I going to survive, trembling in my shoes, living with a human firecracker? I'm only here, at this lovely house to facilitate Dad's transformation from Rural Farmlife, to a close nearby ""town"" as a means of readjusting his orientation as a farmer, to a country gentleman with a nearby community. I'm kind of mixed up right now. My whole body aches because I haven't been sleeping, and have Fibro.. I am scared b/c the younger sister who kidnapped him last Sept. has been calling, getting him riled up, and now claims she is coming here today to ""give me respite"". Except his wife is afraid, as I am, that this same sister will put him on a plane and take him to British Columbia. where she lives.


 My dad has this particularly annoying behavior the is driving me bonkers. There is the thing about restricting food intake, covered in an earlier thread. The behavior that's so irritating is Dad will take a banana, for example, and eat most of it but always leaves a little bit on the end. Sometimes he wraps it in tissue paper and hides it around the house, or, and more irritating, set it on the carpet ""for the dogs"". It gets smeared into the carpeting. He'll make a piece of toast and leave an end laying either, on the floor, or wrapped in a tissue and stuck in some odd place. same with an ice cream cone, he will only eat down to the cone and set it somewhere, it melts. What is it about always leaving the last bit of food. Ice cream will be left in the freezer, in a 1/4 cup size serving, he will never eat the remainder. So, there are bits of food laying anywhere and everywhere . the margarine container is rejected in favor of a newer one while still having a couple of tablespoons. Same with p'nut butter. The last three tablespoons, rejected, a new jar opened. What is this behavior?


 Thank-you Rosie: I love that phrase at the end of your signature :""you can't control the waves but you can learn how to surf"". I gottcha. And you're so right. I find the ""little things"" bother me more when we're having a stressful stretch. For the past ten days, we've been on thetherhooks. Both Dad and I. Because we're so intertwined, and isolated, we bounce off one another when it's the outside things that are problematic. I had a friend one time, who used to describe our relationship, as follows ""two pressure cookers colliding"". Even though i know cognitively, that dad can't help what's going on with his behavior, our lives are so entwined, I lose sight of that reality. All I know is, I'm tired and I hurt and I have too much on my plate. Also, it's being left to me to decide an important family change, being whether to begin to invest in the old Farmhouse, which means tearing the walls out, down to beams, re-roofing, installing some heating system, re-plumbing, re-wiring. Guess what? It just occured to me, I get tired even thinking about it. Then we'd still be out in the middle of nowhere. The other option is to ""sell the farm"". Pay off mortgage, can you believe there's a 30,000 mortgage on the old house. No fire insurance. If i lean a metal ladder up against the house to clean a window, as soon as my second foot is off the ground, I get an electric shock. Just from touching the house on the outside. My Dad's 2nd wife, who still owns 50% of the farm, had a gambling addiction. I think my Dad has been experiencing downhill symptoms for at least five, maybe eight years. He just let her go to the Casinos, easier than fighting. It leaves me with an incredible mess to clean up, both literally, and allegorically. Thanks for letting me , let it out.


 Thank-you, all. The bit about ""wishing to get into their head to know what's going on,"" is so compelling. For example, this morning, my Dad started off as usual, got his toast and coffee, watched the news. then as I was trying to get dressed to take the dogs out, he got so clingy, I wanted to scream. He's a big man, he's standing in the entranceway, while two good size dogs and I are trying to get coated and gloved up to go out. I asked if he were coming?, no, he just wanted the temperture outside. I said, well, the TV is on, it's on the morning news, ok, allright, he says and just stands there watching me. Finally I had to say, ""Dad, I need you to move inside so I can get dressed to go out"". He moved about six inches inside. Like a bounce sheet in the dryer. Just stuck there. When we did get out, he went back in and sat in his chair watching news. I happened to go into the basement, for something from outside, there were eight light bulbs burning in the basement, through-out the night. I thought about it a bit, then mentioned to him about needing to turn lights off behind himself when he goes down to check the basement door in the evening, to see if it's locked. I always do lock it, but he has to recheck, everything. It's getting so I feel like I have to follow him around, watching what his every move will be. We cannot afford to leave eight lights burning all night. So I debated saying anything, decided it was probably best to mention it, just matter of factly, maybe it would stick. He got really bent out of shape. His wife (from the nursing home) had called and left a message for him to call her. I said, your wife called, she wants you to call her back. He stands up, says; ""that's it. I'm going in to lie down"" Into his bedroom he went. I don't know if telling him things like that is worth the hassel. But then if the electricity bill is sky high, that has to come out of our food and trans money. He was late going to bed last night, I'd gone in ahead of him, I don't want to tell him, ""go to bed"". So, I just wait till I think he's gone in and go out and turn TV off, lights upstairs, check burners, etc. etc. I guess I'm going to have to start checking the whole house after he goes to bed, even if he isn't tired at 10:00 PM, I am. Plus, I'm the one up at 5:30 AM to get little dog out. What to do, tell him things that are important, or stay up half the night waiting for him to go to bed so I can double check, everything. This is getting more prison like by the day.


 Thank-you, Rosie. I actually have a tremendous fondness for tea. I drink it in the afternoons. In morning, though, it's that first cup of coffee that brings a feeling of freshness and anticipation of the day ahead. In evenings, it's warm milk with (and this is our little secret, okay?) a piece of really good quality chocolate droped into the hot milk. Stir gently. It's unbelievable. That compatibility of warm milk and really good quality (European) chocolate. The chocolate by itself, is too much sugar. A small piece dropped into the hot milk, just so. We came from a family of dairy farmers. When times were tough they used to drink/eat, a bowl of warm milk with bread in it. I know it sounds odd, but insured self-sufficiency through the hard times. The depression era. My Dad was a lad born into a Dairy Farming family. They were very self-sufficient. I think part of his problem in losing so much to Alz. he has to rely on others, especially me, and he has trouble with that. I certainly would. Odd, isn't it? Dad just a few minutes ago, got up, like he was starting his day all over, in a good mood, and took little dog out to play. So, the demons haunting him this morning seem to have disappeard. Thank-you all. This could turn out to be a pretty fair day.


 Isn't it a blessing to see the ""light"" in his eyes when he can be a littler clearer sometimes? We noticed with Dad that we could tell when we looked at his eyes if he was ""in there"". Oh yes . . . living through the depression would color things for sure. Maybe he is saving his last bit of food for a next meal. Hmmmmmm. Its a thought. Your rituals don't sound at all strange. We make bread pudding . . . Yum!! I also love to make Pumpkin Pie Filling with half the sugar and bake it in custard cups. No crust. It doesn't feel so guilty and I still get to enjoy the wonderful pumpkin custard. Your milk and chocolate does sound yummy. I might have to try that. I've taken to buying some 70% chocolate . . .which comes in tiny bars. They really satisfy that chocolate craving we get sometimes. I'm drinking my coffee right now!! So we have lots in common. I found some really fun things to do with dad when I realized that he I could still connect to HIS passions. He spent a lot of time driving (policeman, race car, ambulance, driving cross country) and I found that even when he was pretty far gone that he could identify the places where he has been on a world map!!! He could show me where he was born (Detroit) and then he'd drag his finger up to Canada where he grew up and then he'd trace back down to Cleveland where he raised his family. He also showed me the many places he served in the military. Now . . . if I didn't know the background, I wouldn't have realized what he was doing . . . because he couldn't tell me . . . but you could see that he enjoyed tracing the map with his finger. One day I was paging through a book of ships. He got all excited and stopped at one page. And tried to explain about that ship. When mom returned home, I showed her . . . and she said that they had ""kept ship"" for about a year and it was on THAT ship!!! Turns out that I was conceived on that very ship!! I hope that you find a real peace with all that is happening. It is really the only way to remain sane when we are faced with the rigors of dealing with this dd. I sure found help here. . . . and I think of all the info I gathered . . . the attitude was the most important part. . . LOL and the only piece that I had much control over. I only cared for Dad about 3 days a week for a few hours at a time . . . so I can't imagine doing it full time 24/7 . . . You are a REALLY special person, Tyno!!! Blessings!


 Tyno, I know how hard it is to be dealing with all this - especially on your own. You need help - please try to get in touch with the AD society asap. I was the sole caregiver to my gma, but I did have my husband to keep an eye on her once in a while as well as my 17 year old son. Even with the help I did have, I was overwhelmed. I lost myself and my life when my gma started going downhill. I realized that it was making my health suffer and for the sake of myself and for my kids, I had to do something. I absolutely hated sending gma to a assisted living but I didn't have a choice. I guess what I am trying to say is that even if you don't think there is help out there - it truly is. It's just the matter of finding it. You shouldn't have to deal with this on your own. It is just too much for one person to handle and if you feel like you can't go on that way, do not blame yourself. You are trying everything in your power. But in the meantime, yes - you are going to have to follow him around. Yes you are going to have to turn off the lights behind him and yes you will be finding lots of odd things that he hides. You have to think of your father not as an adult anymore but a big child that needs supervision. He can not help it - it's this horrible disease. Oh and yes, my gma would hide her food too. When we moved her out and we were cleaning her room. I found a slice of cheese and a banana that who knows how long it was in there - the cheese was petrified and the banana was goop. She would also go in the cupboard and take ONE bite out of every cookie. She wouldn't eat the rest! lol I had no clue why she was doing that. She would also slam the cupboard doors when someone came into the kitchen like she was feeling guilty for ""stealing"" food. This DD is such a trial for everyone involved. Hang in there Tyno, you have a lot on your plate hun but know that we are here for you.


 Bella, it's so hard to understand where their mind is. I often tell my hubby when Gma would have one of her bad days that I felt like I was Alice going down the rabbit hole! :) My Gma does some strange things but she is mostly vocal when it comes to her confusion. For instance, she was having lunch at the home when she started crying. The aids came to her and asked her what was wrong, she said that I was put in the hospital. So they took her to her room and let her call me. I had to reassure her that I was NOT in the hospital nor do I plan to be but for some reason she had it in her head that I had to go there. She also calls me up quite frequently and asks when I am going to see her because she hasn't seen me in months so then I have to remind her that I was there only 2 or so days ago and that I took her out shopping/lunch etc. She has got so much better though since she started on medication. There are going to be a lot strange incidences that it will make your head spin. So you just have to try to put yourself in their shoes and try to go with the flow.


 I have looked after many Alzheimers and PPL with different demetias for more than 25 30 yrs Including both my parents til there deaths I really do believe they are suffering as well ........... I despise what this DD takes from THEM and all of their loved ones LYN


 Good Morning America did a segment on something called NPH which is basically having water in the brain that mimics symptoms of Alzheimers. I think they say that's treatable with brain surgery. It would be nice to see real Alzheimers get treated as well. My dream has always been one day to see a breaking news segment on TV that says they have a definite cure and everyone who has it just needs a shot and their brain will revert back to how they were. Doesn't that sound heavenly?


 Sister Rosie I bow to you I have learnt so much and we have shared so much' Thru the tears here on HW The journeys of our parents and the death of your Dad Death of my MOm and then my Dad What a road we have traveled THanks for travelling it with me my sweet sis


 ((((((((( Lyn )))))))))) Yes, dear sis, what a road indeed. My mantra to those of you who are still deep in the trenches, caring for your loved ones with this dd, is this: Make sure to enjoy your loved one, EXACTLY that way he/she is today. Tomorrow will bring more and different issues . . . But today is all you have . . . so enjoy it the best you can. Search for help. Call your local Alz associations, call your local church, talk to your doctors offices, each of them. Talk to different people in each of those offices. Do all you can to take care of yourself. And enjoy your loved one exactly the way he/she is. Blessings!


 I'm confused. You said it's your house but then you ended off saying you'll be homeless after this ordeal. Please explain. In the meantime I totally can relate to your previous posting about rushing to get your errands done and basically have zero social life. I go straight home after work and time myself each day to see if I can make the 30 minute timeline I allow myself each day. Once the red light at a busy intersection took 5 minutes to change and I started to freak out. I thank the stars that it's my mom that I watch and not my father and she's got a very gentle demeanor. I feel so badly for you for what you have to go through. Please take care and whatever happens you know you tried your best and now it's your own safety you have to worry about .


 I see... Is it so bad for your sister to take him with her? At least your sister wants him. My sister told me if she ever took my mom off my hands it would be straight to a nursing home which my mom and I don't want. You are a nervous wreck and in need of help. PLEASE let him go if it will save your sanity. Just listening to what your father is capable of is making me scared for you. I hate to compare him to an animal but I have images of a rabied pitbull who is turning on his master. He can no longer control what he's thinking or doing and I'm assuming his medication is of no use to him? Why haven't you been in contact with his doctor to tell him/her what's been happening?? Somebody needs to be on your side and give you support."
my grandmother,"this is actually my first time posting on the alzheimers site i am usually on the anxiety board...anyway my grandmother has had alz. for at least the past three years my mom took care of my day until he died then had to move in with my grandmother right after that because the dr.said someone had to or she had to go to a nursing home......which we all know she so badly does not want to!!anyway after a year of my mom doing it by herself she was calling me crying that she just couldnt do it by herself anymore so i made the decision to sell my house and move in here with her to help her care for grandma......sometimes i so wish i had never done it my grandma is getting worse everyday and she is sooooo mean she almost argues constantly cursing at everyone etc.etc. now remind you i have three children ages 15,13,10 and they are my first priorty but it seems that all i can do is do for her and my mom ...its just so frustrating my mom has one brother that lives across the street and we see him about as much as i see u guys his wife comes about twice a week but u would think they would offer to take grandma on weekends to give us some relief but nooooo........im just at my wits ends as to what to do anymore i feel like i have 5 children now as my mother is more dependant on me than ever....i love them all i just dont know how much more i can stand...anyway so for the long post just needed to vent i guess",Dottie I knwo just how hard this is I too had to lok after mom n dad til they both passed and not with any help from siblings I am so sorry tht you are in this sitution Hve you thought about writing them all NICE letters asking them to plz pitch in 'It is getting to hard on you and your Mom.... I know Rosie did this in a way it had her family helping finally Plz keep us posted and know you are not alone God Bless YOU and your MOM LYN

holiday & lewy bodies,"all holidays/lack of family/lack of hope fill me with dread. at least last year did attend thanksgiving/xmas dinner at nursing home but mother was somewhat awake. not this year. she's on fluid diet and mostly bedridden, so would not be with her and in some ways relieved by it. only family (relations) i have (cousins & mother's brother) bailed when the going got tough. friends involved with their family stuff. making it ever more cheerful is that my ms has flared in new and amazing ways, so i'm using walker to get around rather than cane. (would fit in at nursing home... sorry for sick joke) has anyone dealt with this mess? other pain i feel is that i am genuinely estranged from mother and some guilt is probably at work. did you bear your pain or tell lewy body patient about it.. knowing they might or might not understand????? feel i'm doing all i can via nursing home, but now feeling my own pain about ms and holidays. am to the point of signing up for meals on wheels as less able to prepare food. help??!! linda","I am so sorry for all that you are dealing with Yes my family all bailed with mom and Dad so I can get that ....... I would have a big holler myself ..... Like Rosie said YOU have to look after you first hun No guilt plz LYN


 Hun You do what you can do It would be so great if you could do a turkey but if that day comes and you cant so be it Also taking a friend out ...awesome idea WE are always going to be here YOU sound so much more positive THAT makes me so happy Luvs and prayers LYN


 Linda I am so HAPPY for you and proud of you too I wish you the best turkey dinner ever God Bless Lyn


 (((((((((( Linda ))))))))) AHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Screaming for you sis!! There is a little sign posted behind each seat in an airplane: ""Place your OWN oxygen mask FIRST!!"" Especially given your mother's condition . . . be where you feel you need to be. I'm SO sorry you are having so much fall-out from all of your helping and stress. Some hot tea for you Linda!! Blessings!


 OMG!!! i actually feel better! what did you two do? can i do that too? wondering if one of my friends would like to go to dinner... or i could even attempt a turkey? funny how mother's brother was all over her until she signed the car to his son. come time for power of attorney, he totally bailed. said he did it for a friend and it was a lot of work. hell, i have elder care attorney doing it all. house already sold & stuff gone. everything set w/funeral, etc. don't get it. guess being an only child i don't quite get the sibling bull. cousin around until house sold, i gave some bucks to her and sister...maybe not enough? but i sat with her mother until she died. why must relatives be such a burden instead of the support you (wrongly) expect. don't quite get it, but will somehow make it through. get ms ivig treatment next week and hope it eases some of my troubles. nite all! sweet dreams... linda


 yay! invited friend to thanksgiving dinner at a local restaurant, and just made the reservations. what a relief to have done this! linda"
What do you think about this?,"My grandmother has recently been placed in a nursing home due to AD. She has been there about 7 weeks now and when my mother or anyone visits her, she pleads & begs to be taken home. My mother is 70 and can no longer care for her. It is heartbreaking to see her like this. She is refusing to eat, or to do anything or participate in the activities there. Within the last 3 or 4 days, she has started refusing her medicine, and throws herself down on the floor in the nursing home. She won't sleep in her room and wanders around. When my mother goes to visit, she tantrums and yells and screams at my mother to bring her home. My mother is so distressed by this behavior that she doesn't want to visit her, but still goes twice a week. She also feels that she can't take her anywhere because she will think she's going home. I'm afraid that she won't let her come home during the holidays because it will be too hard for her to get her back there after. What are your thoughts about this? It breaks my heart that they wont bring her home for Christmas or Thanksgiving. Would this be detrimental to her getting re-acclimated back to the nursing home? Would doing this set her back? How could it get worse? She's already upset no matter what we do. Thanks in advance for your input.","It must be almost impossible for most carers to understand the dread some people feel about being placed in a NH. Everyone is different and only those who know the loved one the best can sometimes understand what is best for them. Only now that I'm on my own and coming up to 77 do I have a great fear of being 'put away' some day. Should I ever end up with Alzheimer's I would want putting down. That may shock many people, but having seen the way my wife was treated by the so called experts I would not wish it on a dog. I consider myself to have been one very lucky man to have had the great privilege of caring for my wife up to her death. I watched her go down the same route that so many sufferes are still going down today. They reach a stage where they are put in a NH, they're lost and confused, feel abandoned, become depressed, are given medication, wont eat, lose weight, get pressure sores the slowly drift away. I rescued my wife not before time by taking her home as I thought then to die and was told as much. By showing and telling her how much I loved her and in spite of her being unable to talk or move I managed to bring her back to full physical health for almost another five years. With the best intention in the world there is no substitute for caring for your own, no NH can give the one to one care that some people require. My wife's teeth were not cleaned daily, her ears and nostrils were not attended to. When she was in hospital a nurse said: ""She wont eat anything."" I took a yogurt and started feeding her to the surprise of the nurse. I explained: ""How do you thing your baby would feel if I was to take it from your home then tried to feed it?"" The point I'm trying to make is, they need love, to feel secure, to be hugged, made to feel very special and wanted. I was asked some years ago by a psychologist ""Were you told you were no good and that no one wanted you when you were placed in an institution as a child."" My answer ""If you send a child out to buy an ice cream and when he returns he finds a sold sign outside his house and his folk have left, he gets the magssage!"" Love is the best medicine. Don't know if the above is of any use, but I'll leave you with this thought, if you think you're feeling bad, imagine how your loved one is feeling. May your God go with you. Padraig


 It is so hard to be seeing or hearing what is going on with your loved ones ...... Also it is hard for them to get use to being in a different environment such as the home My dad quit eating and taking fluids near the end and there was a DNR on him and nothing could be done My sister had gone against this dnr and I had to have him taken off life support which was so very hard for me I have to say Please keep us posted and know that you are definitely not alone in this others have gone thru the same and I am sure they can help you out with some input PLEASE do stay with us ... I do care about what goes on with all that come to the board and have loved ones........ I have lost both my parents to this DD I despise what it does to so many of our seniors and loved ones LYN God BLess


 It takes time to be adjusted in a new environement. sometimes they may not even able to adjust and they expire due to depression.There's no place like home. It's more comfortable in your own home and you have peace of mind. There's a lot of home care agency who provide caregiver to take care seniors in their own home. Yoi can have background check to the caregiver you're hiring. You can request for their finger print, check her/his references, must have First aid or CPR training and health screening. But if you really can not afford to take her back home, just visit her more often,have patience in dealing with her, don't argue instead redirect her, touch her, massage her head, listen to the music together, and convince her to join the residents activities so that she can have new friends antil she get familiar to the place.


 Thank you for your replies. I am 200 miles away from her. My mother cannot afford to pay for in home care, that's why she had to go to a nursing home that accepts medicaid. They seem to be very nice there, and everyone tries to encourage her to take part in activities, get her hair done, etc, but she will have none of that. I was just wondering if anyone had any similar experiences and eventually their loved one became accustomed to the new living arrangements. When my grandmother was home (in the house she'd lived in for the last 15 years), she didn't recognize the place. She kept asking to go back to her mom's house, which she last lived in 70 years ago in England. I feel so bad that she is distressed all the time. She is convinced the caregivers lock her and her roommate in the building at night and leaves them alone. It is sad to see her reduced to this."
Questions on Why My Aunt does what she Does?????,"My Aunt has Alzheimer's she is 70 yrs old she was diagnosed in January I am her primary CareTaker as her three sons do nothing for her they don't even call her but her disease has progressed rather quickly and she does certain things that I don't understand and don't know if it's the norm for this disease can u guys give me some input??? First of all her short term memory is gone u tell her something seconds later doesn't remember you never told her she hides her purse in the closet as if some one is going to take it and then forgets she put it in the closet and gets frantic looking for it. she checks her wallet every ten minutes looking for her money, checkbook and credit cards, She wants to wear the same outfit every day and doesn't want to take a bath or wash her clothes, If I buy her new clothes or new sneakers she doesn't want to throw away old clothes or old sneakers, She makes up these elaborate stories that u know are untrue like she spoke to someone that she hasn't seen in 20 years, She constantly loses everything even if its right in fron of her she can't find it like going to her room she forgets where her room is. She is in the bathroom all day long with diarrhea she goes through a roll of toilet paper a day. She doesn't want to eat food just junk food and she has lost a lot of weight, she gets very aggressive sometimes because she needs constant care 24 hrs a day she can not be alone at all because she has wandered off and got lost and can't remenber where she lives or who to call also because I have had to take all her credit cards, bank card, checks because she will give info to anyone and anybody and purchse things that she has no money for she says I am not a kid I can do what I want. And she also always says that what some one else has is hers????? Can any of you let me know if this is normal and what I can and can't do I feel helpless and exhausted. Please help. PR Glo","Yes My Aunt trusts me with all of her belongings as I take her to all appoinments and she also lives with me. My Aunt does take medication she takes Namenda and risperidol for the memory and she also takes lisinopril for high blood pressure, Metformin for Diabetes and Lipitor for Cholesterol She was in an assisted living facility for two months once her doctor and myself decided she should not live by herself any longer but last week they told me should could no longer live there because she needs 24 hour care since she keeps getting lost and they are not facilitated to take care of her on a one on one basis 24 hrs a day they wanted to put her in a convelescent home but the ones that are state assisted because she has no money to pay for are filthy and run down and I don't want to put her in those places. I went to see her today at my lunch time because she stays with my mom during the day while I work and she started crying she said something is very wrong with me look what my life has come to I can't remember anything I don't even remember who I am anymore It took alot for me not to cry in front of her but I stayed strong and told her not to worry lets take it day by day. I have no one else to help me but my mother who is her only living sibling and my mom is retired I'm going to try to look for some sort of daycare facility for her to atleast get her out of the house. She does have a bracelet but she keeps throwing away the paper that has pertinent info should she get lost out I have changed it 5 times.


 It is impossible to know what goes on in a loved one's mind. There are ways of helping to understand. One, is to talk to them while they can speak, about their childhood which will be very different from from childhood of to-day. Also keep in mind all older folk are on the normal ageing road and often reminisce about the olden days, to-day's world is strange. Now add the confusion of AD to that it's a bad mix. My wife use to hide money, she was puting it somewhere safe for a rainy day, but she forgot where she put it! I understood, we diden't have credit cards, and as for cloths, I still have cloths for 30 years! we had to make do and mend. The journey back to childhood can be painful to watch, yes they will repeat things but then kids do, ""Are we there yet? are we there yet?.......... I chose to enjoy looking after my baby and learned not to let anyone come between us. That meant me being with her all the time when she went to hospital. I insisted on being present at all times. The doctors and nurses got use to it in time and learned that it was better for her that I was there. Once when she was in hospital they had given up hope, I was told she would not eat. I asked the nurse to fetch me a yogurt, she looked amazed as I fed it to her. I explained: ""Do you thing if I was to take a young child of yours to my house and try to feed it, would he/she eat? My use of a baby bottle was welcomed. I can smile now at the memory of applying lipstick. She would open her mouth to eat, bless her. Against all medical advice I tood her home when they said that there was nothing they could do for her and would put her in the geriatric ward. I've always tried to think the best I could, how I would have acted if I had been in her place. I think I would have hidden food all over the place, why you might ask? We were starved as kids. Who could have understood me? We used slates to learn to write on, a different time and world. As I feel a stranger in the present day world I dread to think how much more confusing it must have been for my wife. I hope this has given you food for thought. May your God go with you. Padraig


 You have a great family and I'm happy for you that everyone takes their turns. It's not like this in my family. Distance is always a factor and excuse. Having brothers is another problem. They are used to being cared for and less doing the caring. We do what we can until someone dies. Isn't that the honest truth? Death is the only end.


 My mom was on Risperdal before. It's a big no-no if you take parkinson medication. It blocks out the PD meds and turns them into shaking idiots. I had to find out the hard way from seeing my mom. Her doctor didn't know there was a problem with the combo. Please be informative with your meds at all time. Doctors don't know everything.


 Thanks. My sister is worse. She said she would put our mom in a home if she were to stay with her.


 (((((((( Bella ))))))))) I'm so sorry your options are so limited. (((((((((( Bella )))))))) Hugs and Blessings!


 SO true Bella (((((((((((( big huggles ))))))))))))))))))))) for you and your Mom God Bless LYN


 Unfortunately, yes that is a ""normal"" symptom of AZ. My gma was the same way except she wasn't aggressive. She would hide her purse all the time and forget where she hid it as well as her checkbook. Then she would just start crying because she thought someone stole them. We found quite a bit of money in her room after we moved her into an assisted living center that she doesn't recall having hid it. I think what you are doing for your aunt is awesome. Not that many people would take the time for the elderly and assist them like you are. Is your aunt on any medications? As for the junk food, you can try making her nutritious meals but make it ""sweeter"" by adding honey, sugar, corn syrup. Does she trust you? Does she feel safe in knowing that you can keep her money, credit cards and checkbook? Does she have an ID bracelet just in case she gets lost again? Do you keep locks on the doors that she can't open? As for her not finding things that are right in front of her, she may have forgot what it looks like that she is searching for. I know this is rough and hard not only on the sufferers but the caretakers as well. Right now, your aunt is scared and confused. The best you can do is try to keep her out of trouble. Do you have anyone that can help you? Have you looked into assisted living centers - not nursing homes?


 Hi, you said your aunt was diagnosed just the beginning of this year? She sounds like she's had it for many years. My mom is also 70 this year and I've been watching her for over 6 years now when she was first diagnosed. I can certainly relate to the hiding her purse and belongings. She hogs all the toilet paper and tissues like they are gold and hide them as well. No one can have a decent conversation with her because she makes no sense. I know it's selfish of me to say this but I really think this disease should be a top priority over cancer or AIDS since everyone will get old and can turn like this. There's nothing worse than losing one's mind and be totally dependent on others.


 (((((((((( pr glo )))))))))))))) Hugs for you sis! It is so hard, isn't it? You are a saint! Helping with your aunt to such a huge degree. God bless you !! Yes . . . hiding things is really common in this disease. We finally gave dad some good looking fake money and he was pleased as punch. But he eventually would wrap it in a kleenex or paper and rip it up . . . so we kept plenty on hand. I would fold it in my palm and ""secretly"" hand it to him . . . like we were passing contra ban . . . he would wink and palm it, take a peek and put it in his wallet. Hopefully, you eventually find ways to manage each of these issues. Some of it is just ignored. When she comes up with the ""stories"" . . . they may be real, but in the past . . . and it seems to me like Dad had a hard time realizing what was in his memory and what was present. So everything he would ""think about "" seemed like it was happening now. The crying . . . Dad did that too. He would say ""My mother is dead"" and start crying. And I would say, ""Yes, she is gone . . . but you were so good to your mother"". He would be so happy to hear that. Other times, he would say ""I'm broke, I have no money."" and cry . . . and I would give him a piece of paper with my name and phone number and tell him to call me any time he needs something. Somehow this was a huge comfort to him, to have that number in his wallet. I probably gave him my name and phone number 100 times, because that's what gave him comfort. Other times, when I couldn't figure out why he was crying, I would say . . . ""Can I pray for you, Dad?"" and I would take both of his hands and hold them. And he would bow his head and close his eyes and I would say a short prayer like "" Dear God, thank you for this wonderful man. He is very frightened right now. Please bless him and comfort him, and help me to know his needs and care for him ."" He was always comforted by prayer. Do talk to her doctor about the D . . . because she might not be getting full benefit from her meds if they are leaving her body so fast . I would also talk to your pharmacist and bring the full list of meds so he can tell you the best way to take them. Some meds can be taken together and some just work better if they are taken a certain way and with or without certain foods. So the offending med, might be best taken at night when the colon may be less active. Just a thought. Make sure you are utilizing the Alzheimer Associations in your area. Ask each of her doctor's what help is available and make as many phone calls as necessary to get some help. WRITE a letter to her sons. When my Dad needed round the clock care, I was going to mom's about three days a weeks for a few hours each of those days. But I was concerned that Mom needed more help than that. My brothers are dear . . . but no number of phone calls elicited any more than one visit. So I made out a schedule and wrote a letter: Dear sibs . . . Mom needs your help. She will not ask and I am afraid that this is taking too great a toll on her. I am spending a couple days each week there, but it just isn't enough. If you could each spend one Saturday per month with Dad, it would give Mom a bit of a break. In birth order, could you each take a turn. Ed, 1st Saturday of each month, Bruce, 2nd Saturday of each month, Donald, 3rd Saturday of each month, Judy 4th Saturday and I'll take the 5th Saturday. Please come at 10 am and plan to stay until 2:00 pm. If you can't visit with Dad on your day, please call a sibling and switch days. Please don't let mom talk you out of your day. She has a hard time asking for help or accepting help, but she desperately needs a break. I have asked her to keep a list of things she needs help with. I started such a list and posted it on the refrigerator, so make sure you check the list each time you come to see if there is anything you can help with. Thanks so much for your participation. I am happy to say that this letter began a couple years of help from every sibling and they were very dependable and actually took care of all items on that list. I was amazed that siblings who were not involved at all were happy to help when they knew exactly when to be there. It was awkward for each of them at first, but after spending a day or two with Dad, they found some creative ways to spend their time together and Dad enjoyed it too. Sorry this got so long and I don't mean to be talking about myself so much, but it is the easiest way to show some ways of problem solving. I deeply appreciate the help I received on this forum . . . so I check back here occassionally, even though Dad is gone, because I know how hard it is to go thru this with a loved one. Some hot tea for you sis . . . and a big hug too!! Blessings!


 For your information Resperidol is a antipsychotic.Namenda generally is given with Aricepet or other AD medication....I take Razadyne..........


 Bella, DON'T give up on those brothers!! I had called each brother separately several times . . . to no avail. The letter rounded up the crew and kicked them into action. This may not work for everyone . . . but ""if you always do what you've always done, you will always get what you've always gotten."" Expect more of them. Be nice but firm. Printing off a letter via computer and risking some postage has almost downside (a bit of time and possible rejection). But it also carries a bit of chance that you will get some help. I actually had given up on my own brothers and thought this letter was going to fall on deaf ears. (((((((( Bella )))))))) I'm sorry you are doing this by yourself. PLEASE don't give up on those brothers!! and I hope you'll accept a hug, some hot tea, and . . . Blessings!


 I could not have given better advice nor said anything more than Rosie has posted Her tea is the best for what ails you Please take care of yourself and no dont give up just yet LYN


 Thank you both. It's not so bad. My mom is the most important person in my life so I don't see it as a burden. Life is what you make of it."
Rember,"This is a new exciting drug from Aberdeen University. Rember comes in the form of a blue tablet and is in the early stages of trials. To date 321 people have been tested and there has been a 81% decline in the progress of the Alzheimer's disease. Larger trials are due to take place over the next 3 to 4 years. The treatment halts the progress of the tangles in the brain. The results are to be presented to a conference in the US. People here are very excited about the drug, some Alzheimer's sufferers have appeared on TV and talked about how Rember has has given them back their lives and how they feel all round better. The drug is said to be in the very early stages and is hoped to be in general use in five years time. Isn't it strange that we can put people into space and yet not put resources into research of a drug that could could save our loved ones from a cruel slow life stealing disease. May your God go with you. Padraig",G Padraig Thanks so much for posting about this I will do some checking into this newest med yes it is weird and strange IMHO That we can put ppl on the moon but cannot help out with RESEARCH enough in this DD that does rob us of so much and robs pour loved ones blind Again thanks and praying for you always Butterfly kisses and God Bless Love LYN **Great to see you posting periodically** Really miss you my friend and mentor LYN

Birds as therapy,"My mother has been in a nursing home for almost 3 years from when she developed dimentia. It now turns out that it is Lewy Bodies causing her failings. Have an amazon parrot that I used to take over to the home to visit the patients. Problem was that the bird was likely to bite so had little interaction with patients. Solved the problem by getting a hand-raised parakeet to take on visits. The bird is a real conversation piece. She's bright yellow and green and has the personality of a true saint. The patients love seeing her and they are able to hold and pet the bird. Works great! Very often the patients don't hold her, but she brings up lots of memories about birds or pets they knew in their youth. Yesterday one older gentleman and his daughters were telling me about JoJo, their parakeet. Another woman recounted her visiting with her grandmother's birds. I am quite taken with the bird myself. Someone advised me to call the bird a therakeet! We make rounds with wipes and hand sanitizer. Sometimes it's the little things that bring a lot of cheer. linda","odettesmom What a great story and thank you for sharing. For awhile when My granddaughters were younger like 8 and 10 years old they did pet therapy at the Nursing home. They had a very gentle standard poodle and they took her once a week. The residents would be waiting to see her. My daughter also has a Amazon Gray named Jazzy Bird but he likes to lure you in and than bite you finger. He also talks and whistles so he does not go visiting. Pet therapy is a wonderful thing. Hugs Kitt


 Aww that is so sweet! How thoughtful of you to bring your little friend to see the other residents I have a Conure myself but I wished I could bring him places. He's a total momma's bird and won't have anything to do with anyone else.


 thank you both for your kind comments regarding the therakeet! i find taking this little bird picks up my spirits as well as pleasing the patients. especially like how they light up when sharing memories about pets/birds they have had. linda"
Medications,"Does any caretakers out there notice more confusion in the elderly person you are caring for when he/she is taking antibiotics? My mom talks jibberish in her native language which I don't understand whenever she needs to be on it and was so confused yesterday that she was trying to put on her PJ shorts over head thinking they were meant to be worn on top and trashed her underwear. Trust me it was not a pretty sight to see. Also, speaking of confusion does anyone out there think taking Namenda makes a dementia person worse off? My mom is on 10mg currently and I wonder if I would make it worse if I gradually stopped her altogether to notice a difference. Sometimes I wonder if that's what's causing her decline. Any feedback is welcomed. Thank you.","Namenda is not for everyone.I was on it for 2 months & I didn't know what was going on & was drooling.I threw it away then called my Neuro & told him what happened.He agreed with me..........


 I feel you on the Namenda Meds My Aunt also takes Namenda 10mg and I think she has gotten worse with her Alzheimers I also thought with her taking her meds the right way every day that she would not get worse sooo fast atleast she should be staying the same since she will never get better. I wonder how we could check more into this because I question Namenda all the time./ PR Glo


 Hi, I've always taken my mom off of medications if I felt she was not getting better from it. I don't think her doctor or any doctor could force someone to stay on a drug if it isn't working out. I've taken my mom off of Namenda many times in the past 2 years but each time I do it she does something that makes me think that she may need it after all. This time she was off of it for 2 days and then one morning after she did #2 in the bathroom I gave her a moist wipe and told her to wipe herself. She kept saying ok ok but got up from the toilet and wiped the walls with it instead. I got scared and put her back on her 10mg dose. But get this... her mind is getting worse still. Yesterday when I dropped her off at the senior daycare center, a man about her age who works there assisted her inside. The moment my mom saw him she laughed and asked him ""where you were last night? You got home late"" She has zero comprehension of anything I say to her. Today when I told her I was going to pick up some takeout for lunch she got up from her chair and took down the clock. I asked her what she was doing and she said she was getting the menu for me. I used to make her recite the alphabet to me daily and now she does it less and less. I also make her write her name and names of our family members. She no longer knows how. She just doodles on the paper and then look around the room. She's hallunciating so bad that I'm embarssed to take her anywhere. Last week she waved at perfect strangers as if they were long lost friends. Whenever she sees babies on TV she waves at them and gets really excited. I don't know if it's Namenda doing this to her or what? I don't know how long it stays in the system so when she was off of it for 2 days maybe she still had some in her or the withdrawal from it made her worse. I dunno I dunno. The only good thing that's happened is that she's doing very well physically from the adjustment I made on her Parkinsons's medication. She can get up and sit down without assistance from the car, toilet seat, sofa, etc. Honestly, if I can choose I would prefer that she was an invalid but mentally alert . At least that way she can follow directions and answer the phone when it rings and talk to people. Am I a terrible daughter?


 This is nothing new. I've told her doctor before. She thinks going off Namenda would make my mom worse. As for the eccentric behavior, her doctor thinks as long as she's not harming herself then it's A-OK. This is why I'm so frustrated. I work full-time and do not have the time nor the resources to switch her to another doctor who may be more capable but is far away and would cost me an arm and a leg for their services. Nothing is ever easy. Unfortunately my mom can't tell me how she's feeling so I have to use my common sense to deal with her condition.


 Such as? Seroquel was one medication she was on for a short time for her hallucinations. They gave her nightmares where she was screaming in her sleep. I literally would jump out of my bed in my room and run to hers before the neighbor would call the cops. My friend asked me one time if maybe my mom has mental problems and not Dementia. Who knows? I left her alone for about an hour this morning while I did some errands. When I got home she had taken off her bedsheet and pillow cases. She had used both bathrooms in the house and neither one were flushed or had toilet paper in there after she was done. A magazine of mine had just been received yesterday in the mail and she ripped about 15 pages of it out and left them spread out on the table. Is this Dementia or just someone going nuts? Her odd behavior got worse after her Stalevo was increased and Mirapex was decreased so I'm giving her 50mg less of Stalevo every other day to see if it makes a difference. I know decreasing it by everyday would make her shake so let's see if this adjustment will improve her mental state. I'm sure her doctor would think it's fine.


 Hi Bella, I'm not overly familiar with all the ins and outs of the meds. But my dad took Namanda and did ok on it for a long while. We did, at one point, try going off it . . . because of a decline. We never know just how bad off they would have been w/o the meds. But sometines it does justify talking to the doctor to discuss the possibility of tapering off to see how she does. Antibiotics . . . it could be the infection OR the meds causing the confusion. Who knows. I hope some of the others who might know more about the meds will see your question. I hope your mom is having some good days too. Blessings!


 Hi, It's hard to tell with my mom. She seems confused with or without it. Her doctor thinks she would be worse off if I took her off but I don't know what she's basing that on since she only sees her for 10 minutes every 2 months. Some days my mom is quite alert and I get very hopeful that a miracle is on its way and then she will say something out in left field and then I'm back to reality. She recognized Hilary Clinton during the convention last week but 30 minutes later every person she saw on tv was Clinton to her. It's like a thought stays in her brain for a very long time.


 If you see it's not helping ask the Dr to take her off it,if he/she refuses you do it......


 Talk to her Neuro.............


 The disease is progressing & nothing will stop it.For outlandish behavior medications can help........."
Nighttime rambling?,"For the past couple nights, my gma has been constantly getting out of bed and she wanders around. She says alot of strange things and even does stranger things. I can't watch her 24/7 especially if I am asleep myself. What is a good way to keep her in her room? I'm afraid she is going to fall again or do something to endanger herself and us. Do I lock her in her room??? I don't really want to do that because she does get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom. I've tried sleeping aids but they don't seem to work with her. Any other suggestions? Btw, during the day she is usually fine. A bit out of it most days but when night falls, she just loses her mind even more.","Thanks Lyn. I have been thinking seriously for the past few days and I came to the conclusion that I may have to end up putting her in a home as much as it would break my heart. I just can not care for her at the level that she needs anymore considering that my own health is going south. I am going to start looking in homes this week for her. I need to research the ones in my area and find the right fit for her.


 Thanks Lyn :) We signed her up for assisted living in a very nice small family owned center. It only has 20 patients in there with a wide array of services including laundry service, med dispensing, social interaction, frequent checks, her family doc is the resident doc there and they will help her with anything because of her blindness. It is on one floor and has a wide, flat floor plan. She will have her own room in which we can bring in her personal belongings and some furniture. It has a window that looks out into a garden but there is fences around the area near the windows for security as well as secured doors which chime if touched. She can even stay there until her end of days because they offer hospice care too. They even have an inner courtyard where they can go to look at the flowers and sit outside. I feel very confident she will do well here even though she is scared. I have been reassuring her that she will like it there and no I am not just dumping her off. That I intend to see her still about twice a week, bring her home for the holiday dinners, take her shopping, go out to lunch or whatnot. Yes, it breaks my heart but I know that this is the right thing to do not only for her but myself as well.


 There is a certain stage in AD they they wander at night. They con no longer distinguish what is day and night. What you can do to make her sleep at night is to keep her busy the whole day. Give her small task that she can handle like folding of towels, a little dusting/ gardening, study her interest and hobby or you can walk with her to the park, just keep her busy and active, and she will be sleeping at night.


 Thank you Minimark for all of that input Lyn


 Red There is alot of problems when having to deal with ppl you care for at home especially loved ones getting out and wandering at night For a time I did have to lock dad in room to make sure he was not hurt but he would piddle in a bucket IF he got up Usually I made sure he wasnt drinking alot after 5 pm...... There is another thing you can do and that is to attach something to her that will let you hear her getting up ( as soon as she gets outta bed) ..... A small bell even at her bedroom door that will alert you as to her getting up might help too Have you been able to inquire at Alzheimer's association or local Legion to see if they have a hospital bed you could use or purchase thru an insurance company that wil have rails as well as that way you can attach a string with bell to nighty Just a few ideas Hope I have helped in some way Take care LYN


 Red I know how hard this has to be in your heart and I do agree your health has gone south so my friend do what you HAVE to do do for you and for HER It is prolly better in the long run There is a thread about Nursing Homes I will bump fpor you You can check out the homes in your area if they are listed about care and all Thinking bout you LYN


 It sounds like a fantastic and safe place for her I am so glad you were able to find this place for her and yes I know it is breaking your heart my friend but you have to do things that will also benefit her and YOU and your family as well and most importantly your health Take care Luvs LYN


 Thank you Minmark :) I do try to keep her busy during the day but recently she fell and broke her arm so things are limited even more then what she was able to do before. She is also almost blind. I do take her outside in the mornings and evenings - not midday because it is too hot for her (and me!). I also take her shopping with me or when I go visit friends. But I do believe you are right about the correlation of being busy during the day and nighttime sleeping. I didn't make that connection. Because her day time activities diminished greatly when she fell and broke her arm and that is when her nighttime rambling became worse."
Xanax and Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"HELLO AGAIN, IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I HAVE POSTED ANYTHING. BEEN REALLY BUSY WITH DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON WITH MOM. YESTERDAY I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE FACILITY THAT SHE IS IN AND THEY WANT TO PUT HER ON A DOUBLE DOSE OF XANAX BECAUSE SHE IS MORE ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED AND IS BANGING ON THE DOOR TO GET OUT. SHE IS IN A SECURED FACILITY DUE TO HER WANDERING. SHE IS ALSO ON CELEXA FOR DEPRESSION. SHE WAS FIRST ON ATIVAN 0.125MG FOR about 6 MONTHS NOW THEY HAVE HER ON XANAX .25MG ONE PER DAY. YESTERDAY THEY CALLED ME AND WANT TO INCREASE HER DOSAGE TO .25MG TWICE A DAY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT SPAN THAT IT STAYS IN YOUR SYSTEM. I HAVE READ SO MUCH ON THIS BECAUSE SHE IS NOW IN THE LATE MODERATE TO SEVERE STAGE. I AM AFRAID THAT SHE WILL BE MORE LIGHTHEADED AND AM AFRAID OF FALLS. SHE REFUSES TO USE A WALKER AND AT THIS LATE STAGE I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD BE ABLE TO TEACH HER AND SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE IT ALL IN. SHE IS ALSO LEGALLY BLIND. WHEN I SAY THAT, SHE CAN SEE TO WALK BUT EVERYTHING IN A BLURR. I CALLED THE FACILITY LAST NIGHT AND TOLD THEM OF MY CONCERNS. I REALLY DO NEED TO TALK TO THEM MORE about THIS. ACTUALLY FROM WHAT I AM READING THE ELDERLY AND DEBILATED SHOULD ONLY BE TAKING 0.125 2 OR 3 TIMES A DAY. AS IT IS MY MOTHER HAS CHRONIC ATRIL FIBRILLATION AND HAS LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. IF SHE CONTINUES ON THIS MEDICATION I AM AFRAID THAT I AM GOING TO GET A REALLY DISTURBING MESSAGE THAT SHE HAS FALLEN OR WORSE. I AM LOOKING TO ALL OF YOU GOING THROUGH THIS TO PLEASE HELP ME AND LET ME HEAR FROM YOU about HOW YOU FEEL about THIS. IF MY MOM WERE TO GO HOME TO THE LORD, I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IT TO BE BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID MEDICATION THAT CAUSED A CRITICAL REACTION OR BECAUSE OF A FALL BECAUSE SHE WAS TO GROGGY TO WALK AND FELL. SHE WOULD NEVER SURVIVE A SURGERY BECAUSE OF HER HEART CONDITION. WELL, I AM GETTING READY NOW TO CALL THEM THEN I THINK I AM GOING TO GO DOWN THERE. I AM EXTREMLY WORRIED. I AM ON KLONOPIN SO I KNOW WHAT THESE BENZO'S CAN DO TO YOU. ALTHOUGH SHE IS 86 AND HAS OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES WHERE I DO NOT, ONLY ANXIETY. THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT, IT MEANS MORE TO ME THAN YOU KNOW. HOPE","Hi Lynn, Sorry about the caps, I didn't even realize it. As far as the benzo's go, being on Klonopin myself for anxiety I have tried to ween my myself off and it is impossible. But going through all of this with Mom, I feel that they are necessary for me at this time. I am on the minimal dosage actually less then that. I see my Mom get agitated and I don't mind her being on something. But the Xanax is simply out of the question, period!!! She is now back on the Ativan and take 0.25 mg in the morning and 0.25 at night. So the dosage is low and that is fine with me. But if they call me and say that they are going to up it because of more agitation, I am going to tell them to deal with it. Xanax is just one of those that you have to keep raising because it does not stay in your system long enough. I was on that as well, and thank goodness I was able to switch without going through any withdrawl. Also, when I get her made delivered to my home from the medicare mail order, I only take down enough for one month supply. That way I keep track and if she were to run out sooner, then either they are going her more or else someone is stealing them. They have to be locked up in a separate cabinet within the medicine cabinet. I do hope that you are feeling better now. There has been a lot of sickness going on. Today I have to go in for an MRI of my neck. I tend to get dizzy at times. But, I also do not have a curve in my neck which you are suppose to and that can cause symptoms. Oh yes, please forgive my ignorance but what is IMHO stand for? Take care, Hope


 My mother also has lewy bodies. Just had a family/staff conference about her and we are in agreement that she is doing much better without any psych. meds. got so that she was asleep all the time and was not aware of visitors or conversations. There was a time when my mother would go violent toward other patients. The medications, however, threw her in the opposite direction. I hope that meds help your mother. Just be on the lookout for over-medication. linda


 Benxo medications tend to exacerbate problems with dementia.In other words it makes the person worse.........


 By the way are they keeping her foot elevated as well Even when sitting you can use a pillow on a chair Edema is not good for anyone Let us know how you made out please God Bless LYN


 Thanks Snowy How are you making out??


 Snowy Your strength and determination is definitely an inspiration to ALL I hope everything statrs getting even better You and Larry have gone thru so much Thoughts are with you and Larry my friend LYN


 Oh my Snowy please do take care I cannot drive too much either due to heavy narcotics I am on....... Thank God Larry can drive Glad you were not hurt my friend LYN.


 Hope I can only only offer my honest opinion here and I know IF it were my loved one the answer would be flat out NO There are many benzo's that can cause agitation and make our loved ones worse IMHO I have been out ill so please DO let me know how you made out and the outcome of all this God Bless LYN ** BTW .in future hun could you make sure caps are off as it looks like you are yelling** lol and I know you arent....thanks


 IMHO...........In my honest opinion I have a thread I am going to bring up for you sweetie Thanks for your kind words.......I am doing tons better Sorry you are not dong so well...... NEVER have shame in having to take the meds at all YOU need them and as far as addiction goes I have been on benzo's for more than 30 yrs ........ I can go off or down and it is not hardly a problem at all I know nothing about klonopin however as I take Valium or ativan......... DO keep me posted on how things are with you and with all the other going on........... DID you ever find the Home she is in on the link in thread I will pop it up again for you God Bless LYN


 Dear Lyn, She is now off of the Xanax, and back on the Ativan. There seems to be a communication glitch with the facility and myself as to how much she is given. I am reading on Dementia with Lewy Bodies that Benzo's are not good for these people. But how do you ween her off such a small dosage? I need to see them today after my doctors appointment. When I went there yesterday I was told that she was having a bad day but not from the person that works there but by 2 family members that saw her when she went into this state. She just sat there and shook. I have seen this before. She will have a blank stare and her arms will shake. So I wrap her up in a blanket and hold her hands and tell her everything will be okay. Then it shall pass in about 2-3 minutes. She is also on Celexa and a water pill. She does have congestive heart failure and noticed yesterday that her one foot was swollen. I simply hate this dreadful disease. I hate to see her suffer. She is aware that she is not right. She told my husband yesterday that she thought something was wrong with her heart because she didn't feel well. She would tell him and not me, because she knows that I worry so much. Well, I can't help it, she is my Mom and I love her. I will post back when I get home from the facility and let you know what they said. Thanks, Hope


 I have to agree with Snowy and the worse one of them all I have seen in my 30 plus career is ativan I DO hope she can take it and not have the agression and halucinations I have seen others have Praying for you and for her as well God Bless LYN


 I agree with Lyn about the Benzos.Not good for anyone with dementia.......


 Been having breathing problems from regweed.We need a freeze to kill it,lol. Larry was discharged from the Dr in Dallas who did his back surgery in June.He goes back to Dr Leeseburg who did the hammertoe surgery on Larry the 21st of Oct & will have exrays done to see how it is healing.He got the stitches out & pins came out 3 weeks ago.Larry ordered new balance 855 shoes & is now wearing them but continues to carry a cane for stability,he's been using 2 canes but now uses one....... Since he has no medical insurance until he's 65(2yrs.) he's going to the VA in Lawton Okla.for meds.or illness if he needs that.But he can get his medications.......... So we are doing pretty good considering.I had problems due to the changes with the surgeries as I was the chief cook & bottlewasher as Larry was before.My Neuro seemed to think I would be fine after things get back to normal the way the were before the surgeries............


 Due to the changes I had since June I was experiencing problems getting confused,since I had to drive home & back for follow up appointments in Dallas that nearly did me in.Dr wouldn't order anything for me as he was afraid I might have a wreck driving,nearly rear ended a gal in her little sportscar.Scraed both of us............After that Larry was able to drive thank heaven,lol..........."
My Dad,"Dad Has Alzeimer's Someome please taik to me I started careing for him 4 months ago and during Ike Dad was exposing himself me to ,calling me my stepmother name and just action all crazy .Right now Dad is concised that someone is coming inside the house and taking his wallet and driving his S.U.V and he is talking back into his child and even talking about death Debbie","Hi Debbie, Try contacting your local Alzheimer's Association. They may have some good resources for you. The things he is doing are so common with this dd. I'm so sorry he is having such a hard time. This disease really robs them of their dignity. When dad did anything that was totally out of line, I would just sharply say ""HEY!"" and it seemed to distract him enough to get him on a new thought. I made sure that I didn't disrespect him . . . but he was aware that I had boundaries. I hope your Alz Assoc is able to give you some good guidance. You can also post specici questions here. Blessings!


 Dear Debbie: I am caring for my dad. He also says and does unacceptable, wrong things. He swears at me. He talks dirty. He calls me by my stepmother's name. I agree with Always Rosie. You have to decide what you will put up with and what you won't. I tell my Dad he cannot talk dirty or be mean to me. When he does I leave the room. I go to my room, close the door and my dog lies between me and the door and he is scared of her. He won't come in. When I don't have the dog, I bolt the door or push a dresser up against it. I give him ""time out"" by me leaving the room. He depends on me for almost everything, changing the channel on TV, getting him food, finding his keys. Finding his wallet. Telling him what day it is. Everything. When I go to my room and close the door he is helpless. I only stay in my room for a little while. Then I come out and we start over, like a new day. It is the hardest job in the world. I hear people say being a mother is hardest. No way! Caring for a person with Alzheimer's is hardest. You get a medal for trying. Keep writing to us, please. You help us too, when you write here. Pauline


 Is your father on medication? I know that caring for someone with AZ is hard. Do you have anyone that can help you deal with your father?


 Keep posting here as well WE will help you thru this okay It is a hard but oh so rewarding thing to have your parents looked after at home and by you I do commend you for this Check all other threads and get some insight into this as well I lost both pparents to this DD within 2 yrs of each other I am sorry for all you are dealing with BUT As said we WILL help you thru it all Stay with us plz Deb God Bless ......LYN"
Hi everyone....new here need some advice about my mother-in-law,"I am about to embark on a new chapter in my life and hubby and I will be moving to KS to be closer to his parents. So I guess I need some advice as to how to handle a current situation with my MIL. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three years ago and still is in the early stages. She can still function as a normal person (drives, cares for herself and my father in law as well as tends to the household things) but I we will be moving in next door to them and I as I have dealt with people that have had this horrible disease before (I was a NA in a nursing home 8 years ago) I know that routine is everything. But....never before have I had someone close to me that has been in this situation and I am afraid that I will upset the balance that exists between my sister in law as caregiver and my mother-in-law whom I love dearly by trying to help. So I guess I am asking is there anything that I can do to ease this transition into our moving next door and her life without upsetting the balance of things as they are right now. Two I have problems of my own as I have Degenerative Joint Disease, CP and FBS that I too am seeing a doctor about . Of course my MIL knows of my problems and is very supportive, but I fear that she will forget so to speak that I too am dealing with things in my own world and expect too much from me. I know that this probably sounds selfish, but I fear that this move will throw her into a horrid complicated world that she cannot figure out. Any ideas? thanks for listening","Thank you so much Rosie for the advice. I think that I was worried more about stepping into a world that I have only seen as a caretaker of people that are not part of my family. Being a CNA I have dealt with AD in a more broader role but this has hit home so hard that even my husband is having problems dealing with it. I do know that my sis-in-law has been trying to work full time and taking care of both mom-in-law and dad-in-law and I can tell in her voice that she is tired. So maybe by hubby and I being there we can add to that extra help for them and bring some rest to my sis-in-law that she so needs greatly. Living next door to my in-laws is going to be quite interesting. I expect my mom-in-law to come visit to get away from dad-in-law and his loud tv as well as someone new to go shopping with. I am ready to pitch in wherever I am needed and think that this is going to be a very good opportunity for both hubby and I. Anyway I hope your day is going well. Scarred


 Thanks Howlncat. I do appreciate all your warm thoughts. I think that I will be able to handle this but I've never had anyone that I love come down with such a horrible disease and I have to wonder if I am not thinking wrong here. The one thing I do not wish to do is to butt in where I do not belong, but I have been told by my sis-in-law and brother-in-law that no worries there that my presence will help them with their tasks of trying to help my MIL with her daily tasks. I am willing to do anything to help them and think that I will be a valuable asset with dealing with the AD. My knowledge of this disease is quite vast as I have dealt with this when I worked in the NH but too my MIL knows what she has and worked in a NH for many years, so she knows that someday she will not know anyone around her and is dealing the best she can with this. I think my biggest challenge will be helping hubby with his own fear that his mom is going to basically loose her mind and I know he is pushing for this move so that he can spend as much time with her as he can before she doesn't remember anyone. He has been there for me through much with my health issues and this will be my time to help him through a tough time. Don't worry about me leaving the forum, as I will stay and keep you all informed as to her health.


 Hi Scarred, Um . . . very valid thoughts. But you really won't know until you take a peek into her world and check things out. I watched my dad drift down the AD road and had similar thoughts as you. I began by visiting frequently while mom was home and then I started ""visiting"" with dad while mom had some time to herself (2-3 days a weeks for about 5 hours at a time). To my total surprise, dad could recognize when I wasn't well and he would motion me to the couch and tell me ""go take a lay down"" Not even my mother was good at recognizing a bad day . . . but dad never missed. Very interesting. So . . . I would usually bring something to do. Tiny jig saw puzzles (which he couldn't manage, but he loved to watch and I'd set pieces near the right spot and he'd work really hard at fitting them in). After I watched him cover one of them in a ton of tape (to hold it all together), we started ""grouting"" the puzzles with Elmer's glue. He was absolutely fascinated with spreading on the glue. I'd slide the puzzle on a piece of waxed paper and squirt on the glue and then he'd spread it with a tool used for spreading frosting on a cake. Then he'd watch over the puzzle till it dried and we'd hang it on the wall. We ended up with an entire wall covered with these little puzzles and he'd show each guest that came to visit. He just loved his art wall. Early on he could even enjoy some computer fun and we'd go to the library and check out a couple compute games or go online and find something fun. You just never know what will interest them. He even liked to stir the pot while we made lunch. I tried to take him for walks, but that wasn't his thing. But I could get out his golf putter and he'd put balls into a small trash can turned on its side and really enjoyed it. We tried put-put the living room putting was better. I took him to some old favorite places. A small airport where he used to fly a plane. A couple places where he used to work . . . I had never been to some of these places, but I would try anything to see if he connected with any little thing. He had done a fair amount of traveling over his life-time . . . so I took out the encyclopedia and found some good maps . . . he showed me where he was born and where he was stationed overseas and lots of other stuff. I really did wonder how I would manage to entertain him . . . but each day brought its own adventure and plenty of things we tried didn't pan out . . . but it was always worth it to try 10 things in hopes that one of them would be interesting for him. You'll find your way. You just won't have a road map for it ahead of time. I really think that God provides a way for people like you and me who just want to help. So glad you will be so near to be part of things. Even having someone to talk to will be a blessing for your father-in-law who will be weary from caretaking. You can bring a meal now and then or help with some things that aren't too taxing for you. I hope you'll post and let us know how things go. Blessings!


 Scarred Hello You will find this an interesting and at times frustrating thing to do BUT it certainly has its rewards I looked after both mom and dad who I have lost recently( dad) mom 2 plus yrs ago.. Rosie and I would trade ideas back and forth with others as to what to do with our parents Know you are not alone anymore and we will be HERE for you I am sure your going to be an asset to your other family member It is a very tiring thing as well For your body and mind lol Especially if they have active minds I may suggessst reading some of other threads as well as checking out Resources Again YOU are not alone Please do stay with us and know we are here to help you and guide you if we possibly can Email me if you would like.......God Bless .......................LYN


 I know what you mean about hubby mine was and is the sam way even though we are now apart I am helping look after his mom who I see some dementia starting and it is so sad You give her a warm soft gentle huggle for me k Stay strong We will help you thru this LYN"
Namenda,"My Gma's doctor is putting her on Namenda for her dementia. I'm just wondering if anyone else or their family members have been on this medication and if so, how did you or the family member react? I've been reading up on this med but I would like to hear of first hand accounts - good or bad. Thanks!","Thanks Rosie :) I didn't see it on the search for Namenda in the treatment of AZ and how well others have responded. All I saw were the ones using it for migraines. Unless I missed it somewhere??? My gma starts it this week sometime. I'm a little concerned for her kidneys though while taking this. It says not to take if you have a kidney disease - my gma doesn't exactly have a kidney disease but she does have bad kidneys (a nephrostomy tube in the right and stent in the left). I think I will place a call to her doctor to see what his take on that is. I'm hoping this will help her gain some of her mentality back, she has been going downhill fast that it's heartbreaking. I am not holding my breath for miracles but one can hope eh?


 Thank you Hope. I will definately keep close tabs on Gma when she starts this med. I am my Gma's advocate too and have had to step in quite a few times when records don't correspond to what the docs have told me. I call myself her little bulldog :)


 Hi Sherry, I hope you get some responses. But you might do better with a ""Search Site"" at the top of the page . . . if I see anything quickly, I'll bump it up. There hasn't been too much activity here recently. Sorry. My dad used Namenda (spelling?) but we weren't really sure how much it was doing for him. They didn't prescribe it till he was losing a LOT of ground while on Arisept. I hope it helps your gramma. Blessings!


 This is a very talked about topic. Maybe not on this site but in the Dementia units with other family members. They said my Mom was prescribed Aricept by her GP and caused problems. I then called her Neurologist and her dementia is in the later stages and said that it would not do much good. I really think that it depends on the individual and what stage they are in. Maybe if she was first dx. with it, then yes, but certainly not now. I really to think that alot of these drugs can cause more harm than good. Of course that is just my opinion. My Mom is very sensitive to meds. They wanted to double her dose of Benzo's and I said, absolutely not. You really have to be on top of things. Last year when she was in the hospital they wanted to put her on seroqueol and I told them not to give it to her. But they did anyway. She has been declared imcompenant and I am her health care surrogate. It's no picnic. I have become very proadvocate since my fathers passing 5 years ago. I get all records even if they have given me the results. You would be surprised. For instance, my Mom was given a chest x-ray and the Doctor came in and told me that it was fine. Well, when she left the hospital, I went to get her records. Come to find out on her chest x-ray it showed Congestive heart failure. I was so mad that I went and set up an appointment with her doctor for a consult. I had the paperwork with me and asked them why was I told this was a normal chest x-ray? She asked me who told me that, I said your associate. Needless to say she was speechless. I wish you all the best and hope that things get better for you. Be Blessed, Hope


 Hi Red Dad was on this as well and I did see a difference in him for some time I truly think it has to do with the loved one and the stage they are in I will do some checking for you ...... Take care LYN"
Feeling down and out,"Hello, I am new to this board and could really use some support about now. Are there different stages of Lewy Body Disease, or is it the same as the Alzheimers? My Mom was diagnosed back in 2006 with this horrible disease. I took her in for evaluation because of hallcinations and the report came back from the Doctor as Diffuse Lewy Bodies. I was told that it had probably been going on for some time because memory loss usually starts about a year prior. My Dad had passed away in 2003 after being married for almost 58 years. I can't imagine the trauma from that. You loose your soulmate after all of those years and have no one to go to bed with and wake up with. He was her life. Okay, now back to my story. When I was in there on Wednesday for when she was having an ultrasound done I noticed some torn paper on the floor. I didn't pay much attention to it at the time because I was focused on sitting on the bed with her holding her hand. My Mother over the past year has been going in and out of conciousness. She will just lay there and not hear you or feel anything. At first I was told it was mini TIA's but now find out it is part of the disease. I am aware from what I read that this Lewy Bodies advances more quickly than Alzheimers, is that right? After about 10 minutes she came out it and then fell to sleep. Her vitals were normal. After she went to sleep, I went over to the paper that was on the floor. Come to find out, it was my Son's picture torn up. I broke down. She had just spoken with him on Sunday. I take my cell with me because he likes to talk with her. She seemed fine and even asked him how were the kids? I realize that this is part of this disease, but really had a hard time with it since she loves my son so much. I also could not locate my sister and her daughters picture. (No big loss) but won't get into that. Just when I think that I have my emotions under control, it seems something else happens. My Mother and I used to do so many fun things together and yes I do have wonderful memories. I think that is why it is so hard seeing her like this now. She can still talk but most of it makes no sense at all. She curses and says words that would never have been in her vocabulary before. She is unhappy and depressed. She is on Celexa, baby aspirin and a mild diruretic. She does have congestive heart failure and chronic Atrial Fibilation. So if she were to fall and break something she could not be operated on because she would die on the table. I guess the reason for me writing is because, I can't for the life of me understand why these beautiful people have to go through this. And yes, when you say it is harder on the caregiver that is so very true. I have been to therapy over and over. I realize that the life span of this disease is shorter because of the advancement, but are the stages the same as with Alzheimers the same and do you have to have every symptom on the list in that stage? If not, then my Mom would be in the last stage. Well, I have been longwinded enough for a first timer on here. I wish to pray for all of you caregivers out there because it is not an easy thing even though they are in a facility you are still the one facing every crisis and every change that they go through. Thank you one and all and any feedback is certainly welcome. Be blessed Hope","Thanks for the reply. I am already on Klonopin and have upped my dosage twice. I have been on anti-anxiety meds for years. I have tried antidepressants but they always counteract with my klonopin. I am very sensitive to these types of meds. I wish that I could be one of the tough ones but its the seeing her go downhill that does me in. I don't go as often as I used to. My husband told me that was only hurting me more. She has no sense of time anyway. My Mom is in a Alzheimers care unit and it is secured where she cannot get out. They also recently put braclets on them which I though was an excellent idea. I am going to go to one of the support groups that they have next Wednesday. I was going to another one, but dropped out because it was not helping me any. Hope


 Dear Padraig, Thank you for sharing that with me. My Mom and I are extremly close. Sometimes she calls me by my sisters name and that used to bother me but not any more. She does recognize my husband as well which is good. When I visit with her, I always hold her hand and give her hugs throughout the time that I am with her and tell her how very much I love her. And when it is time to leave then I never say good bye I tell her that I will see her later and another hug and kiss. She is a very depressed person and they have her on medication for that. Sometimes I think that losing a loved one could bring on this disease. I hear that so often that once once spouse goes the other can possibly come down with it. I am not sure how true that is. She does have menenogomas in the brain which I am sure by now have grown. But I am not going to put her through another MRI. That would not be fair to her. I want her to have to best quality of life as possible. She was living with us for a while, but she tends to wander and that put the fright into me and thought I am not trained in this and needed to find a professional place for her to be. Although, she is in her 4th place now and I simply love it. The people are wonderful with her as well as they communicate with me which I never had that before. Well, I better get a move on, I am going down to see her now. Thanks again for your letter and God Bless You! Hope


 Howlyncat, Thank you for your response. I do the best that I can for her. Does DD mean what I think it does? You are right, I cannot for the life of me understand this disease. My mother knows that she isn't right and get so frustrated when she can no longer get the words out to make a sentence. You mention that you wrote a piece on Lewy's Body Disease, could you please tell me how to get to it as I am new to this board I don't know how to get there. I certainly do appreceite your time in writing to me, it means a lot. I am sorry for your loss. It must have been devastasing to lose both parents to this disease. The reason that she was labled with Lewy Bodies is because of her hallucinations. I am now worried about me coming down with it along with my son and grandchildren. I know that this is going to sound off of the wall to you, but do you think that when her time comes that an autopsy should be done to verify this type of dementia? I honor your opinion. Thank you again and God Bless Hope


 HOPE I believe there is much more to learn from the threads and resources How is she doing lately my friend God Bless LYN

 Thanks to all of you for your kind words. Yesterday I was going through her Medicare Papers and found out that she had some Physical Therapy back in June and July. So I called her facility and they told me it was for a balance issue. First of all I told them that I am very proadvocate and am mad that no one told me about this, plus I told them that, ""Gee, wouldn't you be off balance if you were legally blind too?"" The fact is that you cannot try to teach these people something new, they forget. What is wrong with this picture??? Plus the fact being proadvocate, if I knew about it, I would have checked to see how everything was going? I was also told by the facility that it was not related to any kickbacks or anything like that. That seemed rather strange to me for them to mention that out of the blue. Well, I will talk with them this morning and get all of the paperwork from this PT. It cost medicare almost $4500.00. I will report later in the day as to my findings. Thanks again Hope


 Many caregivers have a need for antidepressants to stay cool,calm,& sane.Ask your Dr abbout them.Do you have hands on care for her or is she in a facility?Even tho it is stressful for you...........


 Hi Hope, I think I know how your Mom must feel. I'm at that place now, my wife passed away last December after 52 years marriage. As to how you feel I have also been there, I placed my wife in a NH when she could no longer walk after a fall and was injured. Fortunately I removed her after a year and cared for her alone till the end, almost five years. Prior to going into a 'home' and while there I was like most other people, upset, stressed and on medication. It is not possible to think straight when you are upset. Only when I had the control of her care did I have to learn so very much about the illness, enough to write a book which I'm on doing now. I've yet to get to the part on the Alzheimer's 12 years journey. There are some simple things we tend to miss when confronted with what we perceive as strange behavour. We forget about our loved one's sight, in many cases it can't be tested. It doesn't improve with age, I should know, so if your Mom sees a picture it may not be of the person as you see. I recall about six years ago seeing two girls advancing towards my wife and I, they we two of our teenage grand daughters we had not seen for some months. Only when they spoke did I recognize them and I don't wear glasses. Many like me in their late 70s and 80s tend to look back on life, most have achieved what had to be done. My wife did not look back, but like most tried to go back home and did so in her mind. It was good to go back with her to a different world, one we both knew and understood. How I wish I'd got to know her as an even younger girl. I tried when it was too late, she could no longer talk in the final five years, this in spite of knowing her as a seventeen year old! I'm going to break a rule of never giving advice and just say; keep telling her how much you love her, kiss, hold and embrace her. If I have given you food for thought I'm pleased. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Welcome Hope I have lost both parents to this DD and I despise what it does to our loved ones I have written out a piece on Lewy's body Disease I am sure there is something in there to help you IMHO it does progress quickly ..... I am so sorry that you had to see that part of your mom hun they do get angry and aggressive and take it out on those they love That is the hardest part of this DD Know that what you are doing is HELPING your mom no matter what she may say or do This is for sure Love and touch is so necessary for them I held my Dad's hand when he went to his Maker YOU are now no longer alone God Bless you and your MOM


 Howlyncat, I did manage to navigate to the Lewy Body site. Thank you again for your caring. Hope


 Good Morning Lyn, Well, this is the second time this week that I have received a call that she has broken her glasses. I had bought her one of those bands to hook on her glasses, you know one of those ones that bikers use. So, I am going down there today and taking the glasses and going to Walmart and get some heavy duty frames if there is such a thing. She has been declared legally blind so I don't know how much good they are to her. The problem is that she cannot go with me, because she is so disoriented and with my anxiety I can't handle it. I am frustrated and I hate this disease. I love her so much and just have to try to remember the good times that we shared when we went on vacations together and laughed so hard we cried. I wonder why God put those people that we love through this H _ _L? I find some comfort in listening to Christian music and church and know that one day God will take her home to be with him. My father is waiting for her. I also find comfort in getting in the pool and turning on music and dancing. I think that helps me more than anything else because I am helping my body exercise and my brain isn't on overload. Thank you so much for your care and interest, it means more to mean than you know. But then again, I am sure that you understand. Regards Hope


 Morning Hope Sorry I have not been around Out ill I know just how you feel hun about this DD as do all that loose their loved ones to it Please know you have been in my thoughts and prayers How are things going now??

Tiny,"Tiny, How was your mother today? Daddy is doing pretty good. At your nursing home they don't have a schedule of activities that you could look at to find out when the singings are?

Dorsey's daughter","hi 9ball, i'm glad your daddys doing good. yes, they have a calender at mommas nursing home. but it didn't have the music on it for some reason this month. and we put momma in the alzheimers unit (locked) about a month ago. it was a hard disicsion. but she hasn't had a uranary tract infection in weeks. they had hot dogs and music for the whole nursing home today. me and my sister took her out of the unit and in there where she could hear the music. she had fun. she hasn't ate anything today though. i'm hoping she'll eat a good supper. you take care. let me know about your daddy. thanks lyn for checking on us.


 Tiny, Daddy is in the alzheimers unit also. It is also locked. Daddy has been in the nursing home for 2 1/2 weeks now. He has stopped asking to go home every day now. It is so sad.

He seemed really tired. Lyn, Yes, thanks for checkin on us. Dorseys daughter

"Alzheimer's vs. Dementia, what is the difference?","Hi, I'm from the UC forum, but in this particular instance I'm looking for some information about symptoms of Alzheimer's and Dementia. It's not quite clear to me whether dementia is a form of Alzheimer's or not. My grandmother who is almost 87 years old has gone done hill over the past 4 years. It all started with these bladder infections she kept getting. In the beginning I believe she did have a couple, but then she kept getting them and the doctors couldn't find anything. At the same time all of that is happening her eyes are getting worse. She already had had cataract surgery. However, it's really been in the past 2 or so years that things have escalated. They found out that one of her younger sisters (I'm not sure if she's ever been diagnosed) had dementia. Then my family started to think that maybe my grandmother was starting to show signs as well. We were never sure if the bladder infections were in her head or not. At the start of summer her legs started to bother her and she began using a walker because she was scared she might fall. My grandfather says she is constantly asking him to help her do this or that and now she can't (?) even get out of her chair to go about 3 feet to the bathroom without asking him to help. She apparently hasn't been able to actually go. My granddad is getting exhausted and doesn't seem to have a moments peace even when the lady that comes over 3 times a week is there. What's been happening lately is that she's yelling out in the middle of that night. One night a couple weeks ago she pushed her med alert necklace because she thought a burglar was in the house. My granddad can't seem to be able to put her into a nursing home and although no one in my family wants that to happen things don't seem to be getting better. Right now she is in the hospital where they are running tests to see if they can find out what's wrong. My mom got a phone call from my grandfather and he said that my grandmother called him and ranted and raved that ""they were killing her there and she wanted out now."" Sorry this was so long, but I'd like to hear what you all think. She's never actually forgotten who we are or anything like that. She takes so many medications including methadone (for the pain). Also, she's been saying she wants to die because she hurts so bad. It's confusing also when at times she sounds pitiful on the phone and other times she sounds normal. Thanks for any feedback, UChick","Hi there and welcome to this forum There is a thread on AD and that will give you the symptoms and all for Alzheimers There are many forms of dementia and it can come out in so many ways\ Forgetting is one Being afraid is another Convinced someone is stealing or going to hurt you is another I hope you will also check out some of the other threads and see how they may or may not apply to GMA I will bring some to top for you do you know all the meds she is on?? Take care and God Bless LYN


 Hi I am so sorry to hear your GMA has to go to a Nursing Home There are some really caring nurse in most places Some Dementias can really go quickly thru the loved ones while Others have them living for years with it It sure is a horrid dd that does take your loved ones And cause alot of pain for those caring for them If possible visit as much as you can She will know and even if she may not seem to recognize you Keep talking to her and doing things with her I am sorry for the anguish this has got to be causing you and your family My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family PLEASE Keep me posted as to how she is doing There is plenty to look at in Resources and other threads on AD and the effects it has on the whole family I will bring some up for you Be well and Prayers are with you LYN


 Red Thanks for posting You are spot on How are you doing anyways LYN


 FORMS OF DEMENTIA The following are conditions that exist that possibly will manifest with symptoms of confusion or forgetfulness, or other behavior associated with dementia. A. PROGRESSIVE DEMENTIA : which implies that there is no current cure and that will continue to progress with futher dementia-like symptoms. These are Alzheimer's Disease, latter Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Khorea, Lewy's Disease, Pick's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Sundown syndrome. B. NON-POGRESSIVE DEMENTIA : implying that with the proper care and treatment plan by a physician, the resident can recover from these dementia like symptoms. These are : Depression, stress, head injuries, brain tumors, dehydration, malnutrition,strokes, blackouts, infections, blood pressure, transfer trauma, hormonal imbalance, chemical imbalance, blood pressure, surgeries, drug addiction and alcoholism. Dementia is a medical condition that interferes with the way the brain works. Symptoms include anxiety, paranoia, personality changes, lack of initiative, and difficulty acquiring skills. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of dementia. It proceeds in stages over months or years and gradually destroys memory, reason, judgment, language, and gradually the ability to carry out even simple task.


 Red I think you have done the right thing for her You are a great gd I bet it was weird with out her there I bet she will be the toast of the home in No time Gentle huggs Hoping you feel better Luvs LYN


 Hi! U Chick I'm soo Sorry that you have to go through this pain and suffering but I'm glad you found out exactly what your Grams has and that you and you family have found a way to help your Grams and yourselves. I am also going through the same my Aunt is 70 yrs old and was doagnosed with Alzheimers in January 2008 and now I just signed paperwork to put her in an Assisted Living Facility She does have her out bursts at time and her disease has progressed rather quickly she thinks some nights that there are people trieng to get into her apartment and she even blames family stating she has no more money in the bank because we stole her money. and just this weekend she could not recognize her grandaughters baby pictures she kep asking me who they were. It's sooo Sad but we have to keep all the good memories in our herts and mind and do the best we can for them. Let me Know how things are going and if you just want to talk. GodBless you and your Family. PR Glo


 I am so sorry she is going thru this and you are feeling the pain I have felt so many times Dad wanted to be with Mom and now he is I believe they are happy to be together again and Smiling down on us No doubt having a dance or 2 ........... I am really happy you do come here and talk about this as it will eat you alive if you done get it out Take care and email me anytime God Bless LYN


 I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 57.then 2 yrs ago at age 66 I insisted on being retested as i was doing too good.Well the new diagnoses is Vascular dementia caused from low bloodflow to the brain or strokes which I had one 4 yrs ago.................This is just a different form of dementia as there are many...........


 Well, I got news today that the doctors have diagnosed my grandmother (officially I guess) with severe dementia. I don't see how it can be severe when the worst of it has just happened in the last couple of weeks. They won't let her come back home and the doctor said she has to go to a Nursing Home, not assisted living. I think night is the worst. She's been sedated because of outbursts and to keep her calm. I don't even want to think about her living like that. The closest family member to my grandparents' home is my uncle and he's two hours away. It's going to be hard on my granddad too and I know he'll be lonely. Thanks for letting me vent. UChick


 I know how sad it is to see the one you love become another person that you can't recognize. But know, that deep down, even if she doesn't know who you are or where she is - that she still has a spark of HER still in there. I am not sure who these conditions are harder on, the sufferer or the family members. Hang in there and trust me, I know exactly what you are feeling at the moment.


 I'm hanging in there - no need to get into ALL that is wrong with me! lol :0) But I placed Gma in an assisted living center yesterday. She was very nervous but she has already made a couple friends and I am so happy for her. She has been quite lonely here with us - I mean she had us but she didn't really have many friends. She became basically a shut in and didn't want to venture out to make new friends. I think that was the hardest thing for her because before she moved in with us and before Gpa died, she was very socially active. I feel very good about her being in this new place and my mind and heart is at ease. It was so very odd though to wake up this morning to NO Gma! I honestly don't know what to do with myself! lol


 Thanks Minmark I think there is a thread already on types of Demetia But apprecite your posting How are you doing LYN


 I'm okay, thank you. I'm busy in my job and in Parkinson's support group in LA, California. Hoping you feel better and I admire your courage and your positive attitude in facing life after what happen to your parents. minmark


 thanks for all the replies. apparently my grandmother has the most problems at night. by problems i mean acting out saying things like ""they're to kill me"" and last night she called the police and said this to them. it's like she's gone down hill in the blink of an eye. she's not a violent person and this has all come out of nowhere. the worse part is that she was blaming my granddad for her being there and she yelled at him that she hated him and that he didn't love her anymore because he wouldn't take her home. she wasn't this bad until she was admitted to the hospital that week. I know she doesn't know what she does because most if tge time she never remembers any of it. i hate that this has happened to her i can't tell you what a God-send this website is. I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about all this anywhere else. thanks for listening. UChick"
Link between diet (notably fat) and Alzheimer’s,I heard a radio program that said that there was a link between diet (notably fat) & Alzheimers. Do you think that this could apply?,"I dont believe so either They are always looking for the WAY OUT there things that may cause AD They need to really do some good research Thanks for posting LYN


 Wives tales...........


 I have not heard any of these being the root of AD. I am still glad you posted and got responses however and now know that 99% believe they are not truE and or are just wives tales. Stay with us LYN


 No.........


 Personally, I have heard aluminum cookware, antiperspirants, lack of mental stimulation (ie. didn't read or work puzzles, or listen to radio enough). and now Fat. If six people lived in one household, as a Farm family, and one mother, and one of the sons developed Alzheimers, and nobody else in the family although they all ate exactly the same foods, I would look at genetic links. That seems to be at the heart of the matter. Like so many other mental affectations, like BiPolar illness, these seem to be passed down through the genes. One of my sons has ADHD and his Grandmother and a couple of cousins have ADHD, I'd be looking for genetic factors, exacerbated by life stressors, use of street drugs being the first which pops into my mind.


 Thanks everyone, I was just wondering. popsie"

"""nursing home"" vs ""memory care"" with respect to Medicaid/Medi-Cal","Hi, I understand that once a person is in a 'nursing home', paying with savings, and their savings eventually run out, then Medicaid (or Medi-Cal in Calif) will pay for the care. Is 'memory care' the same as a 'nursing home'? My mother has Alzheimers, and we'll be moving her to a 'memory care' soon, so I'd like to understand the semantics.... thanks","Replied to Email Rod Take care LYN


 HI there I am from Canada but I am sure that this would be considered the same and there is supplemental monies alloted for helping have her in care from my experience Email me if you would like I am sure ppl from the States may chime in and give you an idea as well GREAT question ..thanks LYN"
New Drug - Not available yet in US?,Has anyone heard about Dimebon. It's an antihistime that is in trial studies for use for alzheimer's. I do not think it's available as an antihistimine in the US - can someone confirm? My mom has an upcoming doctor's appointment and I would like to mention this drug to the doctor. Thank you!

 Antihistamines make ppl with dementia too antsy,edgy.........Some can take them,but most cannot......"
Not sure what to think about the nursing home doc,"Hello everyone, My name is lynn. I am a normal member for crohn's disease, chronic pain and fibromyalgia. My Mom was diagnosed 6 years ago by a neurologist as having dementia but he never came out and said Alzheimer's Disease. Anyway, my husband and I moved her down to SC to live with us because of our concern for her living alone. 18 months ago her heart began to fail and she had a pace maker implanted in October. One year ago this month she went into congestive heart failure and her heart doc said it was no longer safe to care for her at my home .. thus she ended up in a state funded medicaid bed. As soon as she entered this facility they took her off the namenda and then 4 months later her aricept. I have to question if this is normal or abuse of some sort. Also, I just found out they have been giving her risperdal. When reading the info on this drug it said ""WARNING: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIARELATED PSYCHOSIS It said not to give it to people who have irregular heart beats etc... I am wondering if this doc is trying to kill her and let's face it.. who would know when she was admitted with congestive heart failure. No autopsy would be preformed. Needless to say I pulled her out of that place this last week. I cannot take it anymore. She has an appt. with our GP Friday and I only hope there hasnt been damage done that cannot be fixed. Also listed below are other medications that the nursing home doc put her on. I have to wonder if this in not nursing home abuse and malpractice of that doctor too. They also have her on Simvistatin with this interaction ""SIMVASTATIN and RISPERDAL (RISPERIDONE) Severity: Major Descript ion: Taking risperidone and simvastatin may cause the amount of simvastatin in your blood to be higher than usual, increasing your risk of side effects. side effects.... muscle cramps or spasms, have muscle pain or stiffness, feel very tired or weak, or have diarrhea. RYTHMOL SR (PROPAFENONE HYDROCHLORIDE) and RISPERDAL (RISPERIDONE) Severity: Major Descript ion: Taking propafenone and risperidone together may cause serious problems with your heart. WEll excuse me but she is in congestive heart failure... why give her anything that may cause heart problems. duh.... Anyone else find this happening to their loved ones? How can I ever trust anyone but myself to care for her now. I have to wonder if maybe I should bring a law suit against this place if only to make them more accountable for what they are doing and how they are medicating their patients. Best of health to all and please ... any suggestions comments... go for it's or don't bother trying to sue.. anything will help me with the huge desicions I am now having to face with having her back in my care 24/7. I myself am on disability for the past 6 years due to chronic inflammatory disease along with the others listed in my signature. Please.. any feed back will be greatly appreciated.","HI to both I am glad you got your mom out and back with you 'I am just hoping no major damage has been done to her at all thru this I dont knnw what goes in the minds of some of the docs really that look after ppl in NH I do know from experience a doc is usually there perhaps 20 to 30 min even with over 100 patients It is a ""Push them thru world"" Please kep us posted on how she is doing LYN


 Lynn There is a thread with Nursing Homes listed and all about them on this page Check it out I am so happy you got her to the doc and he saw trhe major mistakes before anything horrid happened Stay with us and let us know how all goes LYN


 OMG What a horror story and what a time she went thru YOU have all the right to bring her home My dad was full of cancer and in his brain as well I brought him to live with me when I moved Some homes and nurses DONT have time and dont have the caring to worry about ppl in the homes IMHO Personally IF it were I I would have them PULLED up on the carpet and answering for what your Mom went thru ........ Please do let me know how things go THERE IS NO resaon that this should have happened w/o them knowing IMHO God Bless LYN


 Hope I could not have said it better myself WE have to be very cautios and diligent with our loved ones OUR ELDERLY are not Throw aways ........they deserve to be treated with all the Dignity and Respect always no matter whether on medicare or not IMHO Lets face it IF not for them............. LYN


 Sorry to hear about your Mom and your problems also. When you get sucked into the medical system in this country (U.S.) with all the drugs, I'm sorry to say that you are on a downward spiral of health. When you understand what really creates health you will understand why I am saying what I'm saying. I've done tons of research over 20 years on this subject, so I'm not just talking off the top of my head. My Mother just recently got sucked into the system and this is what happend. Mom had an irregular heartbeat so mostly to see what was going on, we took her to the ER. She was then admitted and started on high doses of Amiodarone to try to correct the arrhythmia. They also started her on loveanox, coumadin (rat poision), crestor, aspirin. All these drugs when she had not even been on any up to this point in her life (age 85). Also, without even talking about why these were being administered. (Her cholestrol reading a few months ago was very good??) Bottom line, she started internal bleeding a week later and almost didn't make it. In my opinon, you will die quicker once you start the drugs that only treat the symtom and never get the root cause of the disease or problem. To be healthy you must find those things that work with your body for healing. Doctors do not get any training in this area, only in the area of treating symptoms via drugs. Do your due diligence and do not place the care of your health in anyones hands but your own. Emergency medicine has it's place, but for builiding good health, don't expect your doctor to be able to help you....


 Well, we had our appointment with our GP doc today and when I showed him the medications that the nursing home doctor had put my Mom on, and those he had taken away from her he just looked at me and couldn't come up with an answer as to why anyone would do such things especially with her heart being in such poor condition. He was flabbergasted is about the best word I can think of. at any rate he took her off most of the drugs they had her on except for the heart drugs that she was on prior to going into the home, and re-wrote her Aricept prescript ion etc. I have decided to notify the state of GA about this home and even contact a lawyer on my mom's behalf. Who knows, maybe I will get lucky and be able to afford in home care for her as her disease worsens. I truly believe they were trying to get rid of her quicker than God intended for her to come home. After all they make much more money with private pay than they do with the unfortunate ones who end up on Medicaid.


 lynnb, My mom was also put on coumadin when she went in to Atrial Fibrilation, that was when they said I couldn't care for her anymore because it would not be safe for her. The Monday just before Thanksgiving I get a call from the nursing home that she had fallen two nights ago but they didn't have time to call me until that Monday. Then I brought her home for the Thanksgiving holiday from Wednesday and took her back Saturday. I bathed her while I had her and she was black and blue from head to toe on her backside. She was bleeding from the rectum, when I went back to the Home with her I made the nurse come to her room and look at her diaper and the blood in the toilet. she said ""probably just hemorrhoids, we'll keep an eye on it. The following Monday they call me and ask me to come and take her to the doctor cause she is bleeding from the eye. I said um... I am an hour and a half away.. maybe you better call an ambulance, when she arrived at the er she was all but dead. Her blood count was at 4.1 She had such a terrible urinary tract infection that they ran the test twice because they couldn't believe the result. They gave her 3 pints of blood and one pint of clotting factor. I should have brought her back home with me then. She had been bleeding internally for a week and they neglected the bruising and bleeding and forgive me but the had me convinced they were professionals that could provide proper and safe care. Why oh why didn't I see it before it got to this point?


 Hello, When I read posts like this it makes me sick. My Mom is in a facility where the patients are all demented so the doors are locked. I certainly hope that you are your Moms POA and Health Care surrogate. I tell you the stories that I read are so very familiar. The problem that I have is not only the medications that they put her on, but there is not enough help, but they are in the guidlines for the State of Florida. Would you not think that those guidelines would change for demented people??? These are people that need constant supervision and one person cannot be in 10 places at the same time. I really do feel for you as everyone else going through this disease with a loved one. I have had my Mom in 4 facilities. What does that tell you??? I really don't want to move her again because everytime they are moved with this disease they get more and more confused. I love her so much but I feel sometimes that I can't take it anymore. I am on meds for anxiety. Gee, can't imagine why. And as far as these doctors go, they put them on what they want. But I am going to be talking with the doctor today and that is going to change. A word to the wise. Be your loved ones advocate. As I am reading most of you are otherwise you would not be showing such love and concern. I wish that I had known about advocacy 5 years ago when my father passed away.. If I had of read one report of a test prior to his open heart surgery, then he would have never have even had the surgery. The report stated on the test that due to being severly debilated a non-ionic dye was used. When I got this paper and looked up the meaning of this I almost threw my computer at the wall. Severely Debilated - a severly weakened state. So can you tell me how in the world his surgeon gave him a 95% chance for a better life if he had a mitre and tricuspid valve reapir done? If you are severely debillated you are not a canidate for open heart surgery. But I have to say the this was elective surgery and the surgeon knew that he would not agree to it if the odds were not in his favor. How very sad is that???? What a JERK!!! When my Mom started receiving medicare papers she was so upset by other things that were done to him she call me everyday to come over and look that them. He had other surgeries that we did not even know about not to mention my mother did not release the authorization to have it done. My father could never speak again after the surgery. And if that was not enough, come to find out he had 33 infectious diseases while in the hospital. Was never told of any of them. Well, I am sorry that I got off track, but it makes me mad. These elderly are just a number to some people. I wonder how they would respond if it were a loved one of theirs? Anyway, I wish all of you the best of luck and by all means stand your ground. If you have the power to make those decisions, then you make the call. The doctors may not like it, but that is just too bad. It's your loved one not theirs. Be Blessed, Hope"

Need help or advice,What do you do when the person you love and care about decides that they no longer have the will to live? Who every time I turn around she says she wants to die and join gpa? That she wishes the doctor would just put her to sleep? I try to be there for gma as much as I can but she is in a deep state of depression. Would medicines be wise at this point? She has early AZ. I just don't know what to do for her that it's tearing me up inside.,"Thank you Yana. She has a docs appt next Tuesday so I might bring it up to the doc then. Is there any medication that should be avoided in someone that has AZ that you know of?


 I would get her to the doc Red dad always said this after Mom passed and I know he was waiting to be with her YES they do go into a deep depression I have had ppl in homes that seem to pass from a broken heart after losing life partner Very dang sad Medication just might be the option she needs right now Let me know how it goes plz Hugg to you and yours LYN


 oh red ,i know how you feel.The best way is to get them a good doc who listens and get them medicated ,be sure to get them medicated and make sure she takes it and introspect the close behavior. good luck !!!


 Y W Red!Ask doc ,they can help you better.I am not aware of medication to be avoided.If i get to know will share info with you dear.Good luck for tuesday!! hugs yana"
Newbie here,"Purple is my favorite color, then magenta then indigo. Anywho. I am a common contributor to two other Healing Well forums, and got to thinking, hey, These Alzheimers folk might have some ideas, suggestions, support for me, also. See, about two years ago my Dad tracked me down (I was in Gypsy Mode) and said please come. So, I did. At the time I thought (as did he and his wife, my stepmother), I was coming for a couple of weeks, maybe a month because she (stepmother) has developed Kidney disease, and needed help getting set-up for Dialysis. Well, lo and behold. I'm still here. Apparently, Dad had been ""forgetting"" stuff for about five or more years and clever lady she was, she was covering for him. (she was also a compulsive gambler so having him in la la land, facilitated her supply of the family finances). Two years later and a walk through Hades and back, it's just he and I, two very clever dogs, and more cats than I care to talk about . So, if ya'll don't mind, I'd like to dial you up a time or two as some days get pretty rough. My sibs have taken off, one moved 4000 miles (not kms., miles) away, the other moved to New York and got 'real busy, getting real busy', if ya'll know what i mean. So it's just me, and me poor mixed up, sometimes angry and belligerant ol Dad, these two great dogs and more cat's than I care to disclose. Thank-you","Thank-you, tinybit. My dogs are my life. i guess my Dad too, but some days I get so frustrated with him. He yells in my face sometimes, like yesterday. He doesn't understand what I'm trying to do and he thinks I don't know what I'm doing, him being A Man and me just a lil ol girl so he yells. This is the part I can't deal with. Also, his coming into my room. I have my bedroom at the far end of the house and he's started more and more to come in when he has a problem, to ask for help. Sometimes it's justified, like this morning, he apparently has a sore back from overdoing it yesterday, but yesterday, and every other day when he's overdoing it, I try to warn him, don't lift so much, take it easy. But no, him being a big man and all, he lifts, then he whines, just like I'm doing know. Otherwise, the cats. Well, this story is both tragic and funny, like so much else, in life . We have a large property, 20 milles from here. It is a run down farm. I lived there with Dad and briefly with his wife until she got really sick and had to go to a nursing home. So then it was just Dad and i. He built the house, and it's in very bad repair. It leaks and stinks and is damp. We go down every two days, or everyday, when we can, for me to care for cats. I prefer dogs. But because we have all these outbuildings people drop cats off they don't want. right now we must have forty or so. I found homes for three. It's a start. But they keep multiplying. I keep a little heater on, we have lots of old blenkets and stuff, I keep the litter boxes clean but all the shelters are full to overflowing. So, we can say, honestly, but no intentionally, we have forty cats. Thank-you.


 Thank-you. Today was a slightly better day. I got to leave Dad on his farm clearing out the kitchen of junk, while I went to a pdoc (shrink). I've been depressed pretty much since I took on this caregiver role, my migraines have trippled, and somedays I feel like it's me ""losing it"". When I leave my Dad like that at the farm, I alert a neighbor just to keep an eye on things. Generally, Dad will clean around his house (he built it, even though it's in very bad repair, he likes the familiarity. So then I get a mini vacation, to see a doc. The doc helps me clarify, helps me to see things objectively and I come away feeling much more in control. My Dad was officially diagnosed a year ago, July past. His Power of Attorney was done simultaneously, because the doctor alert ed us he could sign a release for Dad vis a vis, his knowing what he was doing, at that time but wouldn't for long. We got right on it. I know that it's a very hard road because there is no happy ending, things just keep getting worse. Dad was somewhat intimidating in the doctor's office last visit because Dad scored under 22 on his memory test and the doctor told him he couldn't drive any more. Dad commented about driving a bulldozer right through the building and the doctor told him ""Ï can have you locked up for that"". Later Dad told me he was joking, but, anyway, yes the person disappears and leaves a shell. For example, my Dad fibs, alot. about things where the truth would do as well. I don't know what to make of that. This forum has saved me, it is a wonderful thing. I reccomend it to everyone who might benefit.


 My grandmother ""fibs"" too but I don't think they know they are lying. I believe that for some reason they become secretive and paranoid on occasion and may think that if they tell you the truth to something that is trivial that you may not like them anymore because to them, it may be trivial to us but it's major to them. If that makes sense? I have caught my grandmother several times in lies but I just let it go. Because as long as it's not harming anyone then it doesn't really matter. My grandmother moved in with me 4 years ago and she is legally blind so she appointed me her POA as well as her health advocate. She didn't have any mental disturbances at that time. But when her mental health started declining, I am glad that she had that in place so I could care for her like I wanted. But yes, it is very important to have that paperwork to back you up. To me, it allows me to control her finances better without having to worry about some vulture coming in to swoop up her income.


 Tyno, I have a question for you? Was your father good to you when you were younger? If so, what is your fondest memory?


 Good questions Red I am in Canada as well and it is Turkey day today ...Monday I do hope you wil stay with us and learn as you go along Tke care plz and it is great you are so good with your dad I have lost both mom and dad within 2 yrs of each other I hate this DD Keep posting LYN


 A Very GOOD post Red Thanks for giving us all something to think about and to work on You definitely have a way that shows us all How to care for our Loved ones I have so many good / wonderful Memories of both parents Luvs LYN


 You guys are great. It is difficult sometimes to keep a positive perspective when you are (I am) so tied to this person, 24/7/360 days a year. My brother spelled me 3 times (1.5) days this past summer. I actually spent a lot of that time trying to figure out how it was that I ended up with almost all the responsibility for my dad, and why the other two sibs were distancing themselves from us. The majority of the interaction between my brother and I is phoney, how can I help? but no follow through, if you know what I mean. I suppose the three half weekends last summer was real, but it ended so abruptly. I thought he was coming for the summer to help out when actually he was coming to work, and when that job ended in one month he packed up and went back to New York. My sister came and took my Dad away, didn't tell me she was going to, or where she was taking him, took him to a camp they'd rented about 50 miles away and wouldn't answer any of my phone calls. I had to invoke assistance from the Adult protection worker and the local police to get him home and establish some ground rules around visitation. I have no problem allowing her to come to our house and visit, or even take him for a drive, so long as she tells me when she will have him back, and not drink (as he told it, she and her Hubby broke out the beer midafternoon), he had no idea where he was or how he would ever get home, and said he was terrified when they started drinking. I know I'm whining, for that I apologize but the frustration builds up inside of me and since there is just Dad and I and the two dogs here, I sometimes feel like I'm going to explode if I don't write something, or talk to somebody. Getting the treatment for depression is helping, slowly, but at the same time the reality of the situation which I had burried deep down in the dark place, is coming to the light of day and it's hard to face. I have terrifying nightmares about violence erupting between my sibs and I with Dad off to one side being the subject of the conflict. I also speak too freely in front of my dad about the animosity between we three, and I know, that is wrong. However, sometimes he initiates the conversation asking ""what is son up to. Why is daughter so difficult to talk to"". He doesn't understand. I don't understand either. I know it is related to their feeling the loss of my dad as the person whom they could turn to for answers and help when they needed it. I feel that loss too. I see him daily so am in the middle of his decline therefore I don't notice the changes as they come to me gradually, day by day. The sibs talk to him rarely, and see him seldom, so the changes must seem abrupt and scarey. Maybe that is why they are trying to distance so. Maybe they are Mad at the Disease and they can't be mad at Dad because he is the victim and their Dad. They then can only be ""Mad"" with me safely. I'm not a threat, or am I? Even my pdoc asked me why they are distancing themselves so, and why if they can't physically help out, why they can't at least help a little financially, because we struggle to survive? I didn't have an answer to that question. My dad gave us four (myself, my brother, my sister, and my stepbrother) this incredible piece of real estate just five miles up the coast from where we're presently renting. I had verbal permission from all three of them to sell my share and my stepbrother's share to generate funds to relocate to a better house, that we would own, not rent. Also it would help out my stepbrother as he has a daughter with two young children, whom he'd like to set up trust funds for, and it would allow some funds to be set aside for rainy days, like today, when we (dad and I) are barely scraping by. They agreed until the surveyor was about to divide out our side (about 33%) and then my sister blew the plan up by writing a letter to the lawyer working on the division of the property, calling me a thief and a liar, and saying Dad didn't have anything wrong with him, he was merely elderly, and I was robbing him blind. Dad was cognizant of each step along the way, as was my stepmother, and they both were totally in agreement until whamo, the whole scenario went sideways. Dad still insists we can just go ahead and survey but I've spoken to two lawyers, both of whom say it would have to be decided in the Supreme court and it would cost a fortune. Basically, they both said, we all four have to sign releases to allow a survey to take place. I know I'm long-winded but I am starting to feel a little bit better by getting this off my chest. Phew, thanks for listening.


 I have told my brother that I feel too much of the burden has fallen on my shoulders. As well, my youngest son (21) has told him that he needs to be more involved. My brother's reply was ""my priority is my own family, my wife and my children"". Then my brother gets really nasty towards me so I avoid him because it's too painful to even talk with him, much less confront him. My sister is really unstable (I think). Sometimes I don't know if she's for real, or not. If there was some way of figuring her out. She dropped my mother (who has MS,) 50 miles away from her home when my mother flew there to visit her. My Mother is hard to deal with, but you can't just drop her on the side of the road like an unwanted cat. Don't misunderstand me, I wouldn't do that to a cat either. Also my sister changes her temperment so often, you can begin a conversation on fairly friendly terms and she'll be yelling obscenities at you within two minutes. She changes her mood so often. Neither of my sibs accept any ammt. of disagreement, or challenge. They will do everything in their power to make you wish you'd never begun a discussion. I raised an issue with my brother about something he'd done a couple years back, that I would do now, given the opportunity, regarding the real estate we commonly own. He made me so miserable with unwanted and harassing emails, I was considering blocking him. It got so I was afraid to open my mail for fear there would be another from him. I don't see any happy ending here. I recently lost a good friend who helped me through the separation from my children's father. Bob was his name. He used to say, in this case, ""expect nothing. If he does make a contribution, consider it gravy. that's how I see it."" Thanks for your support. I have to get us through this winter. I need to figure out something we can do to earn a few extra dollars. Like building birdhouses, or tole painting. Something I can do with my Dad that may even result in earing a little extra income. Then come spring I'm going to seriously look at getting closer to our extended family, my sons, and my Dad's sibs.


 Tyno Red poses a great question....... I am a sober alcoholic and I have been since 1979 My dad quit drinking the same day I did The day after my hubby was killed in car accident drinking n driving Have you checked into homecare coming in and looking after dad for a couple hours a day or even for every other day We have that here and it helps out alot You have much to carry and I do hope your family will help MINE never did ....Sad to say or respite care At least you would have some time for self and projects you want to do I know how you feel ....other than the bipolar I wont lie and say I understand a condition if I dont God Bless LYN


 I am truly sorry that you all have this DD in your family I know you will soon find someone that can come in and give you a break Homecare is paid for by government here in Canada Check into that if you want Call the Community Access Care Centre in your area THey will have someone ( PSW) personal support worker come in and clean or do baths and give you time for self ... Just a Thought I hope you will email me . I live in Ontario........Strathroy I would gladly talk to you on the phone IF I can be of any help ....LYN


 dear tyno3, sounds like you do need some rest. i'm sorry you have so much on your shoulders. how's your dad doing? hope he's ok. hope you can find some peace. hang in there.


 welcome tyno3. i hope i can talk to you and maybe give you some comfort knowing your not alone. i have 2 great dogs to. but no cats. i hope you can find comfort and a peace of mind here. i have. i'm sorry about your dad. i know what you mean about the sibs. not helping. except i have a wonderful older sister that helps with my momma.


 Has your dad ever been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimers yet? If not, then he should see a doctor and if he does have it, he may be able to take medication to stop the advance of the disease. Also, if he does have AZ things are going to get harder for him as well as for you. He may decline rapidly or slowly. The person that you knew is no longer going to person you ""knew"". AZ is a horrible disease because it robs us of the ones we love - maybe not physically (right away) but the person we knew is no longer. You are welcome in the AZ forum (or any forum for that matter) anytime you have a question.


 hi tyno3, i'm glad you know that it is a hard long road. but you can come here and we're here for you. i also see a shrink. i'm bipolar, anxity, panic attacks, and depression. my momma is in a nursing home in the very last stages of this horrible disease. it's been a very long road. try to enjoy the time you have with your dad. they do have thier good days and bad ones. talk more later. hang in there.


 Tinybit, I share the diagnosis of BiPolar and do have these attacks where it feels like someone is reaching inside me and grabbing my heart. I can't breathe. All I can do is lie down, get my comforters going (my heating pad and bed buddy, a rice bag,) get in my jammies, close the curtains, take a small sedative and wait for it to pass. I also suffer migraines, and take zomig for that, and have Fibromyalgia, I have pain meds for that. But I can't take the pain meds when I'm feeling anxious because the codeine and caffeine make me more anxious. Also, my pdoc has cut way back on my anti-anxiety meds, because they are cns depressants and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to take antidepressants and also cns depressants. It kinda like swimming upstream. However, he does allow me 1.3 per day. It's kinda funny cause I always need one at bedtime so I have to have three days with no panic attacks, before I can have one. The pharmacist and I were laughing about that. The .3 part. She suggested cutting them in 1/2, and seeing how that works. I put so much faith in these doctors, I sure hope they know what they're doing. Gosh knows, I wasn't doing such a great job when I was driving the bus. Anyway, today is shaping up to be an ok day. My Dad and I are getting along ok. He took a bath first thing this morning (he has grab bars and all in his bathroom.), Also, we probably will get to go visit my stepmother tomorrow in the Nursing home (It's Thanksgiving Sunday in Canada). You want to hear something ironic. I love irony. We are living in this beautiful house overlooking a bay, lots of ducks and geese, three bedrooms, three bathrooms (my youngest defines it as a ""Mansion""when there are as many bathrooms as bedrooms.) We are driving an old car, I picked up for under 3,000. We have about a quarter tank of gas and thirty dollars to get to the end of the month. The irony is, myself and my two sibs own a million dollar piece of real estate just five miles up the road and my brother and sister won't let me sell my share in order to get food, gas, housing (that is ours, not rented), to take care of me and my Dad. They both have really good jobs and really good pensions and won't return calls when dad himself calls and asks for money for food and gas. They just go about their lives like we don't exist. My two sons, one makes $12.00 an hour, the other $14.00 an hour work six days a week and are trying to scrape together enough for us to get a turkey for Thanksgiving. I think that's ironic. My Dad has just again come into my room to ask me what day it is. This is going to be a big problem. he has the run of the place, yet came in at 11:00 PM to ask me about turnips, and just now came in to find out the day of the week. This is going to cause me major anxiety. I can feel it building. I am locked up with this person, 24 hours a day. I can't get away. Now he invades my sanctuary. i will not be able to tolerate that.


 I have to think, a little. One, although he was absent, a lot, and we had like thirty housekeepers to raise us, every summer he would take just the three of us camping, in this hugh Camping Park in the highlands. We'd use one of those trailers that fold down into itself, to haul, but can be put up quickly. Then we'd venture out during the day to waterslide parks, horseback riding, all that. One day he was with us wearing a business suit as he was talking business with this fellow who owned the riding stable (trail rides). We insisted on going for a ride so we all get on these horses and off we go, Dad in his suit, and we came to a river, to cross. Well, the horse Dad was riding stopped halfway through the river, put it's head down to get a drink, and my Dad in his suit just slides forward (must have been polyester), right over the horse's head and lands in the river, my Dad in his suit, soaking wet, got right back on that horse and on we went. There were other moments. Primarily, my Dad was busy making money, and he would pay me to take care of the younger kids. He was really generous with money, when he had it. My mother, well, that's a nightmare. My Dad did the best he could under the circumstances, just as I am doing now.


 Tyno, thank you for answering my question. The reason I asked you that is because even though the man that is in that fond memory is gone now - the memory will always live on. Sometimes when we think we just can't handle anymore, as a caregiver, we have to look back on the person that we love, not what they have become. So when the times get trying, just think back on how much your father worked for you to make a good as home as possible. Being a caregiver is tough and it is a challenge - but never be afraid to ask for help if there is any given. The caregiver has to take care of themselves too.


 Tyno Thanks also to you for sharing with us My parents did the best they could and I am proud to have Had them as parents ...... Stay with us LYN


 It sounds like you do indeed have a lot on your plate. And it's perfectly ok to let it off your chest here! :) I can so relate with you. I was the primary care giver to my grandmother. I have two brothers who are total deadbeat alcoholics and only offered to see gma when I gave them the guilt treatment. One time I was able to get away for the weekend without gma, my brother watched her and when I came back I found out that he was drunk the entire time. So, nope - no way was I ever going to do that to her again. To me, it sounds as if yours siblings are being selfish and not thinking of anyone but themselves. Have you spoken up for yourself and for your father? Have you told them how you feel?


 Tyno, you mentioned that you have BiPolar - do you suppose your sister may have it as well?


 Thank-you. I wrote a too long blurb earlier today and must have erased it, accidentally, however, it was too long and convoluted. My family all has BiPolar. Some try to get help, some try to self-medicate. I've tried it both ways. Right now, because I'm under so much stress, I need a pdoc to help me find my way. My sister won't get help, so I can't trust her, at all. My brother has gone the denial route. ""Hello, my what pretty flowers, we all have."" We're starving here. ""Well just look at all the pretty flowers."" Sooo, I have to figure all this stuff out myself. Respite is kinda not available right now because as a family me


 Thak-you, Lyn; The problem I have is that I am also disabled and receiving disability. It's not much but it pays the rent, here. I had been looking after my Dad at his house but became really ill due to black mould. So, for medical reasons I had to leave. His öfficial address is still there. He is here, alot. If I request Homecare or Respite, I run the risk of losing some of my benefits and then I wouldn't have a place to live. He still has outstanding debts he pays with his cheque. he cannot afford to pay rent, here, also. We're between a rock and the deep blue sea. It's bad legislation and needs revision. If only I were stronger, I'd go on a crusade. That issue, as well as trying to get my sibs to contribute somewhat to his care. The only support I get is from my two boys and they live quite far away. My youngest comes sometimes and watches my Dad at his own house. That's all I can say about it for now. Thank-you, ps. the neighbors close to him over there are very supportive and watch him occasionally. Especially when I have Doctor's appointments. Kinda funny, the last Doctor's appt. I had, I was 1/2 hr. early. I curled up in a ball in the corner of the waiting room, laid my head on my balled up jacket and rested. When the doctor came for me, he asked ""what are you doing?"" I told him it was the most peaceful I'd been for two years. He told me I could come and rest in the waiting room, behind the wate cooler as often as I liked. P.


 Hi Folks: This week is better. It's odd, how we can have a couple of good weeks and then there's this negative shift in my Dad where he huffs and he puffs as if to blow the house down. It's like he's struggling with the grief of all the losses, and he takes it out on the only person around to take it out on, me. Everything becomes my fault. he told me last week to call the people we're renting from and tell them we're leaving. I can't imagin where he would go, if he left here. He would die in that leaky falling down house of his. The woodstove is next to impossible to light because the faulty plumbing has been dripping on it for months and it's soaked and rusty. Also, because the house is damp, the inside wood is wet. The outside wood is wet also because we've had a lot of rain. I'm usually pretty good at starting a fire in the stove, but the last two times I tried to no avail.Besides, it's my disability paying for this rental and I've no intention of going anywhere until I have to. Then I'm moving closer to my family (my sons and Dad's sibs.) I think a big part of the problem last week was us talking about selling his tractor. Although he used it 3 times last year, while we were living there, and hasn't used it in over six months, somehow it's a big deal. I can inderstand, having farmed a good part of his life having the tractor is meaningful, but with this dreaded disease, he can't get it started, and I surely can't either. So it sits there, rusting away. I guess a big part of the solution is predicting what will trigger the negativity and avoiding it."
Memory Test Score,Hello I am new to the forum and appoligize if this is already a topic. My mother-in-law(83 yrs. old) just had a check up and scored a 15 on her momery test.Now I have been looking on the net for exactly what this means and have not found much. The day she was to the Dr. the put her on aricept. The next day the Dr. called her daughter that took her and told her it would not help her and that she should no longer be left at home alone. Now this daughter what's to put her in a home instantly. The rest of the family does not want to do this including the son that has been leaving with and taking care of her. Now I think she my be jumping the gun but maybe I am wrong. Can anyone with a little more experience advise? And what exactly is this score?,"I think if your son wants to continue looking after her at home all the power to him as Snowy said the normal score is 30 she is at 15 so I am sure she can be looked after at home Yes IMHO and it is only mine she can be looked after at home and this is jumping the gun......... Glad you found us here and hope you will look at older threads to see if they may help as well as Resources......... Stay with us LYN


 It was a mini metal exam and the score was 16 not 15. We are currently lokking into at home care thanks to everyone who replied.


 Look up the test score for the MMSE testing.30 is normal.......


 Dear MM I dont give advice professionally on HW..... I write you today as a daughter of ALZ father , and a Pastor, and also happens to one who also one works in health care, in 2 Nursing Homes and have specialized with Allzeimers residents , Residents people I love dearly.. and every day help them thru the moment, enjoying the momements of JOY; embracing those & also knowing when to let go GOOD small visits are better than long ones, that will not be retained in memory... So I write you a a fellow daughter/ sister/ friend. and HW forum member The family may not all agree on what is Best for MOM.... as a sister in law.. who cares deeply... I am sure you know the family dynamics also... please note everyone mustt take care of yourselfs too. Someone will ahve to act as the LEAD. and if a Doctor advises its not safe for her to be alone.. then 24/7 care is needed either provided by family or neighbours/ church/ or friends/ but in time caregivers burn out.... and I see many who fater years of 24/7 or even just a few months are in need of care themselves.. It is Normal for Families to have a hard time, facing the reality of a parent with ALZ.... its one of the most difficult diagnosis I have seen, and as caregiveres we understand espically when one of our own fmaily memebrs has it.. I Feel for you... Where are you locatedd? I am sure differnt countries & states/ provinces have differnt protocalls, here in Canada, you can do some home work and seek for the Best solution for your family & loved one As for the score of 15 it depends if it was an MDS assesment... whcih is out of 18 if it is... the 15 means high total care needed for assiting with daily living... or was it a Mini Mental, often given by the GP family doctor, My advice is talk to your fmaily, have a family gathereing share thoughts, concerns & feelings... but Remember the GOAL... MOM's best Interest... is Number # 1 - How can she have quality of life, enjoy life, be assisted, be safe. Look forward to hearing form you...

Mental Stimulation?,"Is it better to have your loved one try and do things themselves to help stimulate their minds as long as they are not getting frustrated or is it better to do things for them? My gma tries to cut her food and she never gets frustrated when she does it, in fact she is quite patient as she is sawing away on softer foods such as chicken. But watching her slowly making her way thru it makes me want to help her. Sometimes she will let me and other times she won't. So is it best to let them use these ""excersizes"" to help stimulate their minds?","Gma likes to set the table too (even though after she leaves the kitchen I have to redo it) and my hubby tries to help her. So I usually have to slap him away and tell him to let her do it. That it helps to stimulate her. My hubby tries to do everything for Gma that I have to remind him that if she doesn't do it herself, she may forget how to do it. Even though I know eventually she might anyway. I found this out the hard way. One time when she came home from the hospital and she was a bit weak, I was making her breakfast and bringing her coffee. Well when she was better, she would sit on the couch in the mornings - waiting for me to get out of bed (sometimes 2 hours or so after she had gotten up) and give her coffee when I knew she was capable of doing it herself. So I had to sort of ""retrain"" her to get it herself again so she is not waiting on me. Washing hands - lol yeah, Gma has trouble with that too. Of course some of that might be her eyesight since she is almost blind. But she will go in to use the bathroom, she says she washed her hands but I can tell she didn't because if she had a bm - sometimes she misses and it gets under her fingernails. So then I have to take her in there to rewash her hands with a nail brush. Sometimes it's like having another kid in the house :0)


 Hi Sherry, LOL . . . I remember Dad using a knife and fork for EVERYTHING . . . even a cookie. You just made me smile! Yes it's hard to sit and watch them struggle with this stuff . . . but you are right . . . if they aren't frustrated or giving up, it is good for them to do ALL they can on their own. It even helps fill the day. We did try to put manageable food on the plate though. So if there is something REALLY difficult, you could cut it before the plate is brought to her. We had a hard time getting Dad to wash his hands, but he actually liked washing the dishes. So we'd set him up to wash the dishes . . . which got his hands nice and clean . . . but then we'd re-do the dishes after he left the room. Taaaaa Daaaaaa Clean hands!! I hope you've been well. Blessings!


 Sherry Mom was set in her ways too as was dad and I usually had to ""fix"" things lol but found letting them do it was better in the longrun ....sometimes Great question and thread BTW......thanks.. Brings smiles to my face too remembering the things they did I would get frustrated too but just for a bit then just say to self ""self"" let them do it their way ya can fix it later lol Loves LYN"

The Spiritual Journey of Family Caregiving,"Hello Everybody! For five years I was a professional Family Caregiving Consultant, first with the Alzheimer's Association and then with a state-sponsored caregiver resource center in Santa Cruz, CA (Del Mar Caregiver Resource Center). During that time I worked with family caregivers at every stage of their caregiving experience and wrote a monthly email newsletter sharing advice, resources and insights about the path. Most people came to me seeking practical assistance but -- almost without exception -- eventually the conversation would turn to emotional and spiritual issues coming up along the way.

 Mom has had AD since 2000. In a nursing home since August 2006. Just told a few weeks ago that they wanted to move her to palliative care; she is losing weight and her appetite. I am one of 3 siblings. One lives out of town and visits once or twice a year. My brother in town, can't deal with this. So I am the one that does the majority of her care-giving. I work full time plus, so since August I have tried to see Mom every other weekend. Late January of 2008 I got the bad respitory flu so I didn't get to see her until March. Now I am having a hard time to go and see her. I don't believe she has known me for over a year and in the past 6 months she no longer ""lights up"" when I come to visit. Is it wrong for me to not visit so much? Will I feel guilty later? Of all her children, for many years and I mean over 20 years, I have given her the most, loved her the most and I don't think I will have any regrets. Any advise?"

My Aunt has Alzheimers what can we do?????,"My aunt is 70 years old and was diagnosed with beginning's of alzheimer back in January 2008 she is very forgetfull basically she has no short term memory at all and repeats herself over and over and she is very uncooperative with caretakers such as myself she doesn't want to take her meds because she says she doesn't have alzheimers she also takes meds for high blood pressure, diabetes pill not insulin and high cholesterol. My aunt is very aggressive at times especially with her caretakers she really shouldn't be living on her own but does not want to leave her apartment and she has three grown sons and none of them are taking care of her in any way not have they closed up her apartment she was recently in March put into a psychiatric hospital because she was hallucinating and not taking her meds when the police arrived at her home because she had called them they found her outside in her robe running around the back yard of the apartment complex where she lives at 12 am and I was called to pick her up when I went to get her I found several knives around her house because she said she was scared of the people that were outside of her home that were not there. then I took her home with me.and then took her to her doctor the next day and then she was admitted for a week and was discharged to live with my mom which is her baby sister and only living sibling well that didn't work out because she would hide her meds when my mom gave them to her under the bed, in her pocket etc..... so she got extremely aggressive with my mom almost to the point of striking her she left the stove on a few times and also started to say that my mom was stealing her things from her we also bought her a medical bracelet should she get lost they can contact us she threw the paper away that had the info on it so after all this she and my mom got into this huge confrontation and my aunt got in a cab and left my mom's house back to her apartment and she has been back on her own for about 2 to 2 1/2 months I have power of attorney of her but not conservator so there is but much so much that I can do for her and I am only her niece not her daughter I believe she is an accident waiting to happen I have spoke to protected services they told me that can't do anything because she doesn't have a conservator and that per the nurse that visits her twice weekly to administer meds she takes her meds, and presents herself well so she should be fine to live on her own her doctor is also no help all she says is that my aunt represents well and speaks well just repeats herself and can't remember dates and her stories change constantly when she tells a story or something. But my concern is until you are acaretaker and deal with a person all the time you have no idea what i'm talking about my aunts' Dr, nurse worker etc don't spend enough time with my aunt to see what I see and see my concerns so I had to send all parties involved a letter regarding my concerns so that should anything happen to my aunt I will not be responsible they will be for not investigating matters further. I have even spoken to her social worker she states she believes she needs to be in a facility or with family not on her own. Can anyone give me any advise or let me know if I'm losing my mind or just making more out of it that what it is. I an emotianally and physically and mentally exhausted. Please advise anybody what I can do or give me some advise.

 Hi Glo, Soooooo sorry you and your family are having such a hard time. It is so sad to see so many people struggling to try and give their loved ones the help they need. God bless you. I really think that a local Alzheimer's Association might be the best place to start. They have trained professionals who deal with this every day. If you don't know how to contact a local Alz Assoc, maybe you could post the country you are living in so one of us can help you find info. In the United States, here is a link where you can enter your zip code to find local Associations: www.alz.org. Someone else here might have a better idea. I just feel like you need some BIGGER help than I can offer. I hope you'll keep us posted on how things go. Blessings!"
is this a sign of Alzheimer's  ?,A few months back my Grandmother (she's 80) started believing that the people shown on TV are REAL people and not just pictures on a screen. She had cat scans done but nothing showed up with that. So is this just plain stupidity brought on by old age or what? It gets really annoying at times..,"stkitt said... It may be annoying to you but think about how sad and confusing it is for your Grandmother. She has lived a long and productive life and now she is getting confused. How scary that must be for her. Scary? lol She doesn't care in the least and doesn't even act confused over it or understand that the people in the TV are not real.... Our normal family doctor said he doesn't even think it is Alzeimers. Post Edited (sassy1) : 5/17/2008 10:39:40 AM (GMT-6)


 No to be confused you actualy have to understand what you're confused about . If you actually believe you're not confused then how can you be confused? Post Edited (sassy1) : 5/17/2008 10:43:03 AM (GMT-6)


 Welcome to HW PLease do not think of your GMA as stupid as she is not 'For her what she sees is real She may not have alzheimers but I am sure that there is some dementia going on YES she is afraid Think how you would feel if you were in her shoes......I can safely think you would be afraid too Have EMPATHY not apathy and find ways to to be able to talk to your GMA so you can calm her down and try to keep her in a ""Happy Place"" There is a ""Quick Fact thread"" on the forum I would suggesst you read and see if anything pertains to her I Lost both my parents my dad just April 17th of this year and mom 2 yrs before to this Dang disease that really robs us of them THis forum is for support and caring and empathy not for making remarks like that ...... I do hope you will find the real GMA for bits at a time and get memories made with her before she goes.......... EMAIL me if you feel I have been harsh with you please LYN


 I am not going to argue with you about this ..... I really do believe anyone with any type of dememtia is scared........The are losing there memory and all that they have lived in short bursts of time Again this is a support forum not to be agumenting on........ YOu very well can email me ....under name at side LYN


 THANKS Snowy Totally agree and who better to answer with this as someone who has this type of disorder/ disease


 My dad acted like he was totally in charge. He acted confident. He WAS scared. When we sat down and chatted, just the two of us, I would ask him and we would talk about it. He was SO happy to be able to address his confusion and fear. I was absolutely stunned. I had no idea that he felt the way he did. People put on a good show to try and convince others they are ok. I'm glad you spend time with your Grandmother, Sassy. You'll never regret the time you take and the patience you use when you are with her. We will all be old one day and I always try to treat elderly loved ones as I will want to be treated. Blessings!


 I have not seen Sassy, she must not be around. Kitt


 Sassy 1, I am sorry your Grandmother is going through this and no it is not ""just plain stupidity brought on by old age"". It may be annoying to you but think about how sad and confusing it is for your Grandmother. She has lived a long and productive life and now she is getting confused. How scary that must be for her. You may want to check out these websites: www.alzheimers.nia.nih.gov www.alz.org I get the feeling you are quite young as you appear to be a bit insensitive to what is happening to your Grandmother. Perhaps if you read on the links or in this forum you will better understand. Take care Kitt


 Sassy1 "" started believing that the people shown on TV are REAL people and not just pictures on a screen"" IMHO you have described someone that is confused. Kitt


 Sassy1, I forgot to mention I love your name. I had a cat named Sassy once. Loved the cat. I am going to let one of the mods address your comments. I will be following your posts. Kitt


 Howlyncat said... YES she is afraid no she isn't


 It could be Vascular dementia.a trip to a Neurologist is in order ............


 Sassy DO you look after her or just visit occasionally ? It sure sounds like you should rad some back pages and even some of the topics on first page Seniors and pple your gma's age do get afraid that they will develop a demetia of some kind most fear Alzheimers prior to getting it if they end up doing so Please know your GMA is in her own world with some things and I truly believe she needs to see a Neurolgist and the sooner the better for her.......... Well over 5 million plus have Alzheimers and some form of dementai in the USA Canada has 300,000 and more each day ....... It saddens me that your posts make you sound like you are not worried about her but are more or les thinking it is kinda funny and that she is not confused nor afraid........ PLease have whoever her Caregiver or Power of Attorney get her to a specialist in the field of Geriatrics and Dementias............ Take care LYN


 Well said Sis Thanks Loves and God Bless LYN/Sis


 NO me either..... I am hoping SHE does read the posts"
help! Dr's are not in agreement! We are confused!,"My mom took a cognitive test a couple of weeks ago. Her Neurologist said she has ""mild dementia"" He put her on a drug that is used to slow down Alzheimer's and dementia. (Aricept) She had apt. with her cardiologist last week. He was asking what meds she was taking. She mentioned the Arcept. He said..""So..you have Alzheimers?"" She (and my sister) said ""no"" The Neurologist said it's mild dementia. The cardiologist said..""That's the same thing"" ""You have alzheimers!"" My sister and I don't know who to believe. I'm thinking that the Neurologits is the one that tested her. He said ""no not Alzheimers..just the same meds"" The cardiologist said..""Dementia and Alzheimer's and dementia is the same"" WHO DO WE BELIEVE? Thanks for any help. We are confused.","Red is absoultely right There are many types of Dementias Alzheimer's and dementia are not one and the same Some demetias can turn into full alzheimers I will wait to see if you respond to Red's questions..........

 Snowlyn..Thank you so much for your reply. My sister just talked to the Nuerologist. He told her that he believes she has Vascular Dementia because of some ""shrinkage"" they noticed in her MRI. I will do some research on this. Thank you. :)


 I'm not an expert on Alzheimers and dementias but I would definately stick with the neurologists diagnosis. Many doctors think that AZ and dementia is one and the same but the fact is there are several types of dementias. I'm not sure if the dementias can eventually turn into AZ or not but I do know that AZ accounts for 50-70% of cases. Has there been any other testing done for your mom?


 Dementia & Alzheimer's is not the exact same thing though it can be caused by different things.I was dx at age 57 with AD then at age 66 retested & now have Vascular Dementia,one cause is from strokes,or low bloodflow to the brain.Confront the Dr & ask point blank.You learn when you ask then check out the internet.........


 Thanks Snowy Luvs LYN"
For my cousin sister,From last 5 months my beloved cousin sister is suffering with Alzheimer's. She is now 35 and unable to remember anything for even 10 minutes. Most of the times now she gets angry and also confused while working. As per doctor’s prescribed medicines we’re giving her medicines without any fail but really not getting any improvement. On the contrary she looks like she has lost all the controls on herself. One of my friends asked me to try Curcumin Extract capsules which are made from turmeric. Please help and guide me what to do. Thanks in advance!!,"Dear Jenney, I am deeply grieved about your situation. Same problem I have faced with my uncle. We have consulted to doctors and fed him medicines according to doctor prescript ion without any failer but all in vain. We were moving through a tough time. We have lost our hope, Thank god! One of my friends suggested me to use Curcumin and now my uncle is comparatively better. I think you should discuss with your doctor regarding this medicine. Please don’t loose hope. Thanks . henry


 Hi there Jenney I am so sorry about the road you are on I have lost both my parents to this DD I would suggesst taking her to a Neurologist and see what is going on........ There are so many medications now that may help as well ......... Please talk to a professional about anything you intend on giving her prior to doing so Email me if you would like to talk I DO understand God Bless you and Henry for doing what you are for your loved ones..........LYN Thanks LS luvs ya toins..BS


 HI there and Welcome to Healing Well .. I would really suggesst talking to her doctor or a doctor especially a Neuro about any meds herbs or natural remedies prior to giving her ANY There could be interactions with any other OTC meds or RX meds she is on now Has she been DX by a Neurologist for AD? I am glad you found us here Jenny and DO hope you will stick around and get support from this site and the great ppl on it Please also check out Resources and back pages for input that may be of help to you WE are always here for support and help I am sorry but we cannot really give Medical advice only our experiences with it .. Take care and please do POST again God Bless LYN


 Dear Jenney, Accurate diagnosis is critical. I hope your cousin sister has been to the physicians. Early-onset Alzheimer's is a rare form of dementia that strikes people younger than age 65. acording Glenn E. Smith, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Early-onset Alzheimer's has been known to develop between ages 30 and 40, but that's exceedingly rare. It is more common to see someone in their 50s who has the disease. The risk increases with age. The key treatments in Alzheimer's are education and support. This is especially true given the special social challenges of early-onset Alzheimer's. Getting connected to services such as support groups can help you identify resources, gain a deeper understanding and learn ways to adapt to the situation. I am praying for you and your cousin sister. Take care and keep us posted. Kitt"
symptoms of alz,i want to know symptoms during earlier days of alz. thx yana,"Thanks Red I was dealing wih dad and family issues around here ' I appreciate you taking the time toi answer Both Mom and dad had memeory loss and also lil things like forgetting date ** Also forgetting where thigs were placed by them was a sign to me ........ Yana...Keep posting and educating yourself about this DD WE do understand hun honestly LYN


 Read back threads as well as go to resources hun and you will learn more....Alzinfo.com is a another good site many of us here belong to ..... Check out link at side in Yellow as well for Namada Take care Lyn


 There are couple of good websites in the forum that tell you of the early signs - https://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=8&m=548613 My gma's early signs were forgetting names and words for common things. She would stammer and stutter over her words and even then sometimes the correct word would elude her. She also started to lose things constantly or forget where she would put things. Then it sort of escalated to doing odd things and not remembering that she had done it. Such as one time she put safety pins on a pizza that was in a pizza box but denies that it was her that did it. Now she is even forgetting people that she had known for a long time such as an old friend from back home.


 Thx lyn n red,i am trying to learn more here. Hugs yana"
NEED MEDS HELP!,Hi everyone....well....Dad has been in the n/h since March 29....seems to have gone downhill since.....they had him on Aricept.....lost his appetite completely....put him on remeron to calm him down and increase the appetite...not doing it..........seems like all he does now is sleeps and when he is awake is very combative...........barely audible when he speaks........I think he needs different meds cuz the remeron is not doing it for him....seems more depressed than before (if that's possible with what's supposed to be an antidepressent).......anyone have a loved one on a drug that would make him more like himself and calm down the combativeness? Thank you for whatever info you can give me........love to all who are taking this journey with their loved ones.,Welcome Dad was on Namenda and it helped with the arguments and the aggression as well as his appetite You should really speak with a neurologist to see what the best course of meds would be Is anyone geting him up to exercise ......do Range of Motion.....keep his mind busy?? I wish you all the best and plz do email me if you would like to yak about things more LYN
My Aunt's Alzheimer's is progressing !!!!,My aunt really has no short term memory at all she will ask me the same question 3 or 4 times within 20minutes she was diagnised in January 2008 and she also has started some new things which she never did before are these related to her Alzheimers disease she locks all the doors meaning bathroom and bedrooms where she comes out of the room but locks with the lock when she leaves the room and then you can't re- open unless you use a key or bobby pin to open lock she also goes into any room and just goes through anything and everything that is in the room. She has many episodes also where she states there are people in her house and she is very scared and she wants to protect herself from the se people who are not there. Can anyone let me know if this is part of the process or what as I'm getting worried. Thanks soo much.PRGlo,"Yes this is part of the process. I watched my Grandmother-in-law do the same things. She became very paranoid and so forgetful. She would turn on frying pan and walk away. The porkchops were found in the linen closet. She would not come over to her own daughter's house for Christmas that year as we were all talking bout her. She also did not want to leave home as people would get in the house. She locked the basement door as someone might be down there. Poor Grandma and Grandpa, it was very hard for him. They were married more then 65 years. Bless you and I hope wish you all the best. Hugs Kitt


 replace the door handles with NO locks.She could get locked in & can't get out.........


 I am glad you got the input you did I too would take out the locks Something could very well happen to her........ Thanks Snowy and Lil sis Welcome to HW and I DO hope you will keep coming back to get support you need Please do read the threads that are here as well as check out RESOURCES LYN"
HI ALL,"Dear All, Please help me on this issue, as i know some one close who has got this disease recently. Isint there any cure for this disease. Regards","Thanks for the repy, but really it is so sad to see people in this condition. The lady i know she was at my wedding but then now she keeps asking me when am i gonna get married,. She asks for her mom who has passed away from a long time. Once she went for some ones funeral and the lady who had died she asks her husband where is your wife she is not to be seen. Gosh its really scary and i really pray to god that some one finds a cure as soon as possible for this disease. God bless all. Regards.


 No.Medications can help the person do better for a period of time,just no cure.

Oh boy - give me patience!,"It's gotten to a point where I just DREAD cloudy days because it makes gma so much more worse! My family knows that when she has outbursts that it's not really HER talking but how come I feel so guilty - by guilty I mean having gma living here with us and putting my family thru the ringer? I am adamant about not putting her in a home because she really is not that bad yet and I want her here with the ones she loves for as long as possible. But her outbursts leave everyone reeling! For instance, we were sitting down and watching a funny movie when all of a sudden she goes stomping off to her room. I go in there to find out what was wrong and she thought everyone was laughing at her! Everyone was asking what they did wrong and I have to keep reassuring them that it is not them. Also gma goes to bed early (6pm) and of course kids being kids, they will make noise. They're really not that loud but gma will get up and slam her door repeatedly to get them to be quiet. Ah it's nerve racking!","Lyn, I wasn't expecting a quick reply from you :) I know you and Cait's been ill. I hope things are getting better for you all there. My post was a bit of a rant because I was frustrated. I'm all better now :0D No, she's not on any medication but I was thinking of asking the doc for something soon. She has these bouts of depression too where she says she just wants to die and join gpa and just wants to give up. She goes in in 2 weeks for a skin biopsy - doc is thinking that a few spots on her face may be precancerous. So maybe I can ask him about it then. Thanks Lyn and get better ya hear?! :)


 Hey my friend Sorry I am slow at responding been really sick as has Cait THIS is one of the other hard parts you have to live with when you make the decision to keep her with you YOU are right it is NOT her it is the DD and I am so sorry she gets like this IS she on a med that can mellow her out NOT drug her up but to make her more calm and not have some of the thoughts and feelings she is having....also help her sleep more easily and soudly when the kids are still up?? Please tell your kids they are FANTASTIC....it is so bleeding hard an I am so proud of you and your family ...I know how things can get sis and I do hope they KNOW it is nothing they have done .......... All my best and I wil be on tomorrow ..Luvs LYN


 Thanks am feeling TONS better than I was Rant away I know how it can be A good med for this is a calming benzo NOT imho ativan though anything really but it ...I think once she is on something you WILL see a drastic change in her it is scary for her too as you know ......... Again you have got great kids and tell them I said they are and they have a fantastic role model .. Let me know how all goes will ya God Bless LYN"
Emotional or irrational outbursts,"My gma on occasion will have what I call an emotional meltdown. This is where something trivial will set her off and she will go crying to her room. I then have to go in there and try to figure out what was that trigger - for instance, my hubby said hi to her one morning but she didn't hear him so she ran to her room crying. I had to explain to her that yes he did say good morning and that seemed to ease her mind because she thought that since he ""didn't"" say hi to her that he was mad at her. But in the meantime, the ones around us are soooo confused because they don't know what they did! But then she has minor blow outs that leave us equally reeling. How do you all cope with the emotional aspect of this disease? How do you explain to others about why your loved one has these emotional blowouts? I try to explain that she can't help it and to not take it personally. But sometimes that doesn't work. They are just as confused as ever.","Thanks Lyn - you are such a doll :) Luckily these major outbursts aren't too often - not sure if I could handle it if was all the time. It's just so tough because the gma that moved in with me 4 years ago is not the same gma now that I knew ya know? She has been thru soooo much in those 4 years - losing her husband of 50+ years (that is the reason she moved in with us), to repetitive surgeries and bladder cancer. She often says that she is getting too old and she's tired and that she just wants to join gpa. I truly believe she is hanging on for me to tell the truth. Next week I am taking her in for a hearing test but I'm not going to tell her until the morning of the appt. She insists there is nothing wrong with her hearing but she definately does have something wrong with her hearing. So I'm hoping that if she gets hearing aids that it might make her feel more comfortable in social situations because she can understand what is being said. She feels left out because she can't hear what is going on and then that frustrates her and sends her on another emotional outburst. I thought about the med route but I'm not sure I want her to go there yet. I know some of those meds can make them ""zombies"" until their body gets used to it and too she is so tiny that some of these meds don't sit well with her. She's only 4'8"" and 86lbs! She's a little spitfire :)


 My hubby is the greatest and I love him with my whole being. He is very supportive in EVERYTHING which makes him so great. We've been married for almost 19 years and never once has he ever let me down. I told him that at the end of June, he gets to play Mr. Mom because I'm going away for a girls weekend. And he said ""Cool! Now I can fatten gma up!"" lol He likes to cook her breakfast. :) I sat down with Kate and told her exactly what was going on with gma. I told her what to expect and why gma acts the way she does. So she has been making a concentrated effort to say hi to her all the time. It's a start but I can tell that it's pleasing gma.


 Oh i love this thread,red your gma is cute and sensitive woman,take care of her.God bless your family!!! Enjoy your weekend everyone!!! YANA


 LOL Everyone wants to put gma in her pocket! Including the nurses at the hospital :)


 Red.This is not an easy one for sure....their emotions are all over the place the fear of what is going on with them ( I am a firm believer that somewhere in there they are still there to a degree especially with emotions)..... Ya knind oof have to put yourself in her shoes just for a sec or your friends can even try to imagine how she is feeling and how scared she is as to what is happening ..she knows SOMETHING is wrong but cannot figure it out and I am sure she is scared to pieces.....the only safe thing in her life right now is you and your hubby and family ......... She will get emotional or there are those that get violent and have very severe violent outbursts and sometimes will hurt someone that they love dearly not realizing what they are doing......... Not all parts of the brain are totally affected with this DD so she still has emotions and sounds like she is VERY strong in the emotion dept.......My dad is as well .......I will tell him "" okay have a good cry and get it out Dad""and be there when he is done to wipe his tears.......they are basically like children once again and I know I would never wish this DD on anyone......... I just do as you have already done if dad feels slighted or ignored by someone and he has not been then I go and talk to him....and that will calm him down ........ There is no quick fix for any part of this bloody disease that I truly despise and it robs us of so much and our loved ones of so much ya know....... YOU are doing fantastic IMHO and I am glad you ask all the questions you do .......the better you are armed with info the better you are able to handle most of it...there will be breaking points for sure hun......had a few ( quite) myself and then I just get back to doing what I can for Dad......... Your friends can do some research into AD and find out what you are dealing with if they care too and it might help .....IF they dont live with it it definitely is hard to explain........ I am never embarrassed by what dad does ...shocked sometimes heck yes lol........he can be a sweetie one minute and then crying for what I have no idea is all about or yelling and gripping about everything and anything.. I truly wish I did have all the answers.........I am flying by the seat of my pants with dad...Mom was so different in her Alzheimer's so each day brings a new challenge ......... Know I am here for you as are others and we do know what you are going thru ..IT takes a very special person or family ( hubby/wife n children) to do what you's are doing.......... Deep down somewhere your GMA knows this I am sure..........Take care you .......Luvs LYN Ya just have to go with it or talk to the doc and have her put on amed that may help with this as well..........


 I can totally relate to the hearing thing she is going thru I have lost 90% of my hearing in one ear and some in other due to long term usuage of Vancomycin IV ..........so the hearing doc and my doc has explained to me .I get so frustrated as well not being able to hear and having to have hubby n Cait repeat or look at me so I can read their lips . I see it frustrates them as well My mom was a spitfire as well and weighed only 65 lbs at time of her death.......she ate very well but just did not ever gain weight......... I agree that it might be best to wait for meds until she really does start getting worse and hun you know I will not lie it is going to happen BUT I know you are a strong Lady and you have a family that supports you especially your hubby that is so important in this fight.........when there is not suport many marriages have fallen to the wayside over this personal choice to care for loved ones with this DD,.....Sad but so true ...... I am glad yours is still strong and hubby is supportive as well your children.......Is GMA making any headway with the daughter? A hearing aid just might help take the edge off like you said .I will keep her and your family in my thoughts and prayers.......I am here always remember that k Luvs ya ......Huggles to that GMA of yours k


 I am so happy for you I too am lucky to have the support of my hubby and my Cait is fantastic with Dad....... I am so glad your Kate is making a go at GMA I am sure it is making GMA alot happier Make sure you have a fantastic time my friend on your Girls wknd away Thinking of you and keeping you and family and sweet GMA in my prayers....... Luvs LYN


 She ( GMA) sure does sound like a sweetie doesnt she ..........I would put her in my pocket but I know Red would not go for it ..lol You also have a great wknd.........LYN


 Doesnt surprise me Sherry.......she is the type of GMA everyone wants a know .... Take care you Luvs LYN"
Lynn ?????  How is your Dad?,"Hey Lynn . . . Popped over to see how things are in AD world. Wondered how your dad is doing, as I noticed the post in mod forum that he had fallen.

 While I was sick ( very) with Pnuemo I had to have dad put into hospital ......I could no longer look after him and did not want him to catch this either I SPECIFICALLY had on Kardex a DNR in case something happened....... Something happened alright ......my sister basically pulled the same crud as Mary's hubby's kids but to a different tune Dad had to go on life support ......NOT SUPPOSED to have been..... but she overode all I have done even with POA here in Canada the Bio kids speak louder I guess NOT the ones that have had their heart and souls in their parents lives for over 10 yrs .........she is only bio of Dads......he is agaist machinary and tubes keeping him alive ..I know this from the past talks we had before he got sick...I was not told of this TILL after the fact and a couple of days later..........He is literally being kept alive by what he didnt ever want BUT how would she know this .. NEVER have I felt so angry, so bitter and so hurt ...I wanted to well suffice it to say..I felt violently angry Dad has been in my life since I was 8 he is was my dad friend and hero ....... Because his blood does not run thru my veins does that make me any less a daughter..NO it doesnt but my sister thinks so and thinks this is best for him........ I have cut off contact with her and this is because Lawyers have made it to be this way for whatever reasons they have they are the professionals here (PRIOR TO being told by lawyers) I have told her under no circumstances will I STAND for this I am in procedures with lawyers and all of the whole shebang.......I know he wants to be with mom..I know because I have been THE ONLY one to look after him and Mom until her death as you's know..... I also told her when they finally do come and they will to ask about taking him off life support ........I WILL not pull the plug she did this she can do that .........AM I wrong?? Anyways I will keep you updated......tomorrow is the anniversary of Mom's death 2 yrs ago and Monday ( past) was the anni of first hubby's death ......... Like I said I am a broken spirit ...I feel as though my dad has been ripped away from me ......I feel like he has been Violated......It was his wishes yrs ago to me for no DNR Take care all and I thank each of you for all the support love and caring you have shown me thru all of this these last months and months God gives us Angels and each of you are definitely my ""Angels""........ God BLess... .LYN


 Linda I read the post .I know you know how I feel ...you have that abilility always have......... Like I said it does not matter that it is not dads blood that runs thru these veins it is the dad the friend and the hero he will and alwasy has been to me NO I will never forget what she has done either .I too will forgive BUT it wont be for a long while yet I am so raw with emotion over this ....... What gets me the most is this: she knew I HAD to put dad in hospital promised me she would check on him and then WHAM a couple of days later I find out he is on life suport and it was on the kardex and his chart that no resuitation was to be tried .........WHY would I let him come back to life full of cancer and it eating him away ........ I cry literally at the drop of a hat when I think of what she really has thoughts of and the distance she will go to hurt me whilst in the interrim she is not only hurting me she is hurting dad .......... Thanks my friend for your support and love thru all of this I am already worried that he will stop again tonight have had this dang dream he is going home on the day Mom died ...tomorrow ........ I have been trying to have an injuction put in where the DNR will stand and like I said I know the time will come when they will want the bed and he will have to be pulled from machines......SHE can do it .I will not ....That may sound harh but I think she needs to be taught a life lesson thru this .........I had told her Dad did not want to be reliable on machines I was ignored obviously Such is the life ......A journey I have yet t get to the finish line ......your support and words are alwasy a comfort to me my friend...Thank you .......Love and God Bless all that are true sons and daughters no matter what blood is in their veins .......LYN.


 OH NO! Lyn . . . I'm SO sorry! Please know that God holds your dad in his arms with tender care. God is still in charge here sis. We can't see it . . . but you know it.

 Thanks my sweet sis I need all the Blessings and tea I can get right now It has to be Rosie 's tea though none other works ......... Have a great Easter.......a hug for your mom and you ..... God Bless Sis


 Oh Lyn, I am so sorrowfully sorry to hear all this!! I had no idea it was this bad. I just finished posting on the other site, a long bit of it to you about this whole biological thing. When you have time or energy, you can read it. As an adopted child I know as well that blood is not the tie that binds us. My parents were my parents, my only parents, and even in their deaths now they remain my parents. My mom's anniversary of her death was on the 15th. Yes, I empathize with that feeling. It brought up sad memories, happy ones, but eventually ones that I just plain miss her. As for what your family is doing in revoking your POA, I am stunned and saddened. I know little about the law, just enough to find out how badly I was messed over in my divorce and what I have found out in the interim about what I could have done to prevent it. I know more than I thought I would ever have to know about POA, estates, assets, attempted revocation of POA etc. When sister 3, my younger sister, decided to play a part in the care of mom and dad, literally days before each died, she made every attempt possible to revoke all my responsibilities and promises made to mom and dad, especially the ones having to do with the way in which they chose to die, without being held to life by machines. I was a bulldog, had locks changed on the doors, took out restraining orders and phone harrassment charges, anything to keep her away. Fortunately she didn't act soon enough so I was able to honor mom and dad's wishes 100%. Will I ever forgive her for trying to revoke my duties so mom and dad would live long enough for her to attempt to gain a hold on their financial status? Eventually I will, because it is in my nature to forgive. Will I ever forget? Never. The climate of our sisterhood changed drastically and I don't see it ever being the same again, nor do I really want it. She showed her true colors at a time that was inappropriate, in a way that would cause mom and dad suffering and would have relegated them to possibly months hooked up to machines in a hospital. She thought only of herself, something our parents never did. I had to hire lawyers at a time when money was being protected should mom or dad need it. I had to hire lawyers at a time when I should have been allowed to spend every moment with mom and dad. I was fortunate to find an attorney who believed in the fight, who knew both mom and dad, the history of instability and acts of violence by my sister, and was willing to work with me without requiring much of my time. He knew the situation, the law was on my side as far as the POA, and he became my watchdog, keeping my sister and her slimy attorneys away from the house and off my phones. I was able to put those worries aside and be with both mom and dad, allowing them to die in their own time, in the way in which they had always wanted. To this day my sister holds onto that anger, but it is only her that is being hurt by that. She can't hurt me anymore. I hope desperately that you can find an ally in a good attorney who can see the facts as they are, restore the power to act on your dad's behalf back to you, and give you, and your dad, some peace in this final time. Sending prayers, wishes, thoughts, and love your way. Linda


 Hi Lyn, It seems we are missing each other on the forum. I write before I know all the facts, read the new posts and respond, just as you are responding to my response! Must mean we are with each other in some way. I know how horribly painful this is. We are never prepared, even though in our brain we know what is happening. Our hearts don't operate that way, though. I know you have never asked for recognition for doing what you have done for your mom and now your dad. I think that to the outside world, others have no idea of what we do in order to give this quality of care and love to our family. I can admit now, and at the time, that it most certainly was an emotionally and physically challenging time. Years away from the rest of my family, relocating to unfamiliar city, leaving friends behind, leaving teaching, losing my income, losing my mind at times , physical labors of lifting etc. which eventually wore down parts of the body not meant for that kind of labor, and the ensuing surgeries to repair those injuries. The most important thing I will remember, though, is not all of that. It is the feeling I had when I had Mom tucked in for the night, getting a small kiss and huge smile, giving Dad some small before bedtime snack and watching the news with him before seeing him off to bed to join mom, with ""I Love You"" being the last words we spoke to each other each night. . It was that feeling that I was able to be with them, not for the thank you's, not for the admiration or recognition, but for the healing of my heart, a heart that had been so horribly broken just a year before moving to care for mom and dad. Surrounded once again by their love, as when a child, was such a comfort. Mom may not have known me for a good part of that time, but she was still maternal, still knew how to comfort a child. To her I was at times a very nice lady, at times a friend who came to visit often, but on some occasions I was her little girl again, just as she had become my little girl. After Mom was gone I had no time to truly grieve because Dad was suffering so. The heart broken by the man I had loved for 30 years and abandoned by him like a thief in the night was a heartbreak I thought would hurt forever. Seeing my dad and the way he was as his heart was broken from losing his wife of nearly 60 years was at times unbearable. He had been there for me when I was first deserted by the man even he had come to love over all the years. Dad drove the 8 hours, with mom, to let me cry on his shoulder huddled on the couch, hour after hour. Eventually he had to play the dad and forced me to pick myself up and start putting a life together, as hard as he knew it was. He was with me every step of the way. Unbeknownst at the time, he was sitting in the downstairs lobby of the courtroom the day of my divorce hearing and was the first face I saw when I came out of that courtroom drained of all emotion, sobbing, bewildered how my life had changed so without me knowing it. Again he had driven with mom those 8 hours to be my rock yet again. There was no way I was going to let down the dad who never let me down. And he did not do it for recognition, for admiration, although he certainly deserved it. He did it because he loved me and that is the only reason, the simple reason, for me choosing to care for him and for mom their last several years. The years of love and support from mom, before Alzheimer's robbed her of precious time and memory, are years I treasure. She was a strict Scot, as she called herself, but always, always, my safe place to be at the end of every day. Losing that is a loss we are not really meant to bear, I don't think. Loss reminds us of what it is we did lose, all those wonderful things that make us miss those who have passed. We bear it because we have to, but the grief really stays on, the intensity of it changing on and off, good days and better days as well as sad and seemingly unbearable days. But at the end of every day, I know I was loved. At the end of every day I know that I loved. I want you to have that peace, my friend. I will hope it finds you. fondly, linda


 Linda.....I do know I am loved and was loved by mom too My memories are somewhat simuliar reading to dad and having the gardens with mom and special smiles of thanks from her heart and eyes......... Yes I have lost my mind many a time too LOL but I never once really had the need to complain I was doing what I WANTED to do .......just as you my friend........ I awoke this am at 1:17 i believe Mom was in the room in all sincerity telling me it is okay dad will be with her soon and he will be out of the pain he is in and up there with her.........holding hands and smiling down on us ...........I said a prayer at her time of death this am .......I am somewhat more at peace...... God Bless you for being you Linda........And for your neverending support and wisdom.....Luvs...LYN"

 went to see momma yesterday. she caught me off gaurd and asked me where her momma was. i told her she was gone. she said gone where? i said in a sweet voice momma she's been dead for many years now. at first she had a shocked look on her face, then she just said oh and started talking about something else. it was sad. i cried when i left. i hate this disease. thanks for listening.

 Reminding a person with AD that thier Mom or Dad or whoever they have died should be tempered with ""i don't know"" or maybe they are at work or whatever.The truth only keeps the person upset. I see my Neuro tomorrow,& I may go back on the Razadyne.I'm slipping slowly.

"Healing Prayers and Thoughts for G Jean ,.......and  G Padraig","I ask that all the "" family "" here send healing prayers and thoughts to G Jean and Padraig.... G Jean was hurt badly when fell off the bed Tuesday night .........You can read G Padraigs post on his Thread .........Here is an exerpt Hi Lyn, Mary, Linda and fellow carers. I've not been able to use the computer for the past few days, as I'm still getting over shock. Tuesday evening I'd just completed washing and changing Jean's pad, I'd taked the basin to the bathroom, to empty the water, ( less than 30secs ). On my return, Jean lay on the floor in a large pool of blood. She'd slid from the bed and fell hed first on to the wooden tiled floor. She must have had some sort of spasm to start the slide, as she was incapable of breaking her fall, she took the full force of the fall on her face. At the hospital I went through the same fight to remain with her at all times, in the end they got the massage and were thankful for my help with treating her. She suffered a busted nose, chipped tooth, split lip, and a number of facial fractures. Thursday afternoon I was allowed to have her home and my request for visits from a Nurse was granted. Because her eyes were closed with the swelling I felt I'd needed a professional, to pop in morning and evening to treat her eyes with drops. I felt it best I looked after her other injuries. I am only so bleeding grateful she is going to be okay and he will need all the support he can get from us right now He is always here for us as you all know Now it is his turn .......... Please post and let him know that you are here for him and for G Jean 's quick recovery.......... Thanks in advance Luvs LYN","To Padraig and Jean - I hope Jean mends quickly from her hasty fall. I'm so sorry for this terrible accident and Padraig, I hope you are also careful as you tend to Jean. Blessings to both of you. Lanie


 Dear Paidrag and Jean, I am so sorry for your troubles. Your love and devotion is inspiring. You are in my thoughts and prayers. I am hoping Jean has a qiuck recovery and you can both have a wonderful holiday season. Take good care. Love and prayers,


 Thoughts and prayers are with you both.


 i'm so sorry she fell. yaw are all in my prayers. take care and have a good holiday.


 Padraig and Jean, I'm so sorry about what you are going through. Padraig, you are so devoted to Jean and I know that the special love and care you give her will help her to heal quickly. You really are very special. You and Jean will be in my prayers. Sherrine


 What a horrible situation! I'm so sorry for both of your pain. Healing vibes are coming your way!


 Padraig and Jean, Just to let you know you are both in my thouhgts and prayers. Take care. Dave


 Never in all my days have I experienced such warmth and caring people. To put it mildly I'm overwhelemed and deeply moved by your kindness. It hadn't occured to me till just now, that only our son, daughter and her youngest daughter have been in touch. Thank God for our daughter, so like her Mom quietly supporting me. It was so lovley to see the youngest grand daughter. I'd love to hug them, that's something I'm incapable of doing. I'm not sure what to think, one grandchild out of 9 being in touch. The Oldest boy I can understand, as he and his family are in the process of moving to our town next week. The not so good news, he was offered the choise of three tours in six months time, Iraq, where he's done two stints and one other place for a year. He's opted Afghanistan again! His wife and child will be staying near by us. I can only guess it's the story of my life, even family see me for what I am, a lone stray, able to cope with anything that life throws at me. Thank you all very much for your kind thoughts and prayers. Just as well you are not able to offer them in person, I'd be so scared, I'd run a mile, but I would love to lighten your loads. Padraig


 G Padraig My wish for you and Jean today is peace and healing. You are in my prayers during this holiday season. ""Christmas - that magic blanket that wraps itself about us, that something so intangible that it is like a fragrance. It may weave a spell of nostalgia. Christmas may be a day of feasting, or of prayer, but always it will be a day of remembrance - a day in which we think of everything we have ever loved."" ~ Augusta E.

 HI and Weklome to Healing Well ... There is much to learn about AD and what it can and does to our loved ones There are many threads on here that are well worth reading as well I would suggesst you read in Resources and in my opinion the 36 hour Day Book is the best The progression is different with all AD or 99% of them I would say ..... I am so sorry that your brother has this DD ..I lost Mom to this and complications and I am now looking after my dad who has Alzheimers as well .... He is going downhill but I think more from a broken heart ya know ...

(Step) Grandma with early alzheimers... Please help!,"Hi Darren . . . bless you for caring so much about your stepdad's mother. It does sound like a quandry . . . but who would be visiting her if the friend took her away? and how often would she have company? Her best scenario in a NH is if she has very frequent guests. It somehow makes the staff more accountable for day to day good care. Even a hospital visit is best with frequent visitors. What can you expect? Each Alz patient is SO different. Many will function quite well for a long time. There are some who post here who have had Alz for a long time. I have heard that once the disease is active, the average life is about 10 years. My dad died in January after less than 10 years of diagnosed Alz. He would have periods of many months where he didn't lose any ground, and then . . . whoops!! . . . he'd really slide backward. I'm sorry there's no real time-line . . . but I can say that he became quite lost, mentally, before he started losing continence. He didn't seem to understand that he had lost control of his bowels and bladder, but it was still so hard to see. He was also very unwilling to cooperate with normal toileting and changing so we had to find lots of ways to encourage him to cooperate. Hopefully some of the others will know more about the meds. Dad took Aricept for a couple years and then Nemanda. Mom also gave him Ginko Biloba which she said got him out of a sleeping funk. I hope you get some responses from some of the others here. Welcome to the forum and God bless you for taking an interest in your Step-grandmother. Your involvement will be a huge blessing to her.","Hi Darren . . . You are very welcome!! My dad actually functioned as a city Service Director for about a year after we all KNEW that he had Alz. His darned doctor would NOT acknowledge it and delayed care for about 2 years. After he retired he was able to function on his own (driving and being home alone while mom ran errands etc.) for another couple years as I remember. Taking away the car keys was the most difficult step as Dad was actually a pilot, race car driver, previously a police officer for many years, etc.). We started ""visiting"" with Dad while mom went to run errands when he could not stand to be left home and he didn't want to go with her. From there it evolved to him actually needing to have 24/7 care. Each step unfolded bit by bit and we all adjusted to the new agenda. There was no way to foretell how long each milestone would last before he would begin another downward spiral. But the spirals would always bring him down with a tug as opposed to gradually eroding things. I know how desperately you want to be prepared for things, but things really do unfold as they will. God gave each family member a day-by-day Grace to manage each step. We never had enough Grace for tomorrow, but we always had just what we needed to get through today. If a little encouragement could help, that's my little montra for you. From all you've said, I would join my voice with the relatives who want to keep her in the UK . . . but only if you are committed to visit her. The only way for me to consistently do that, was to say to everyone in my life . . .""Monday, Wednesday and Saturday are reserved for my Mom and Dad"" and I didn't plan anything else on those days so that I could do this important thing of being their for my parents. You are a peach of a grandchild if you are able to set aside a day a week to visit your Grandmother . . . whether she can show appreciation or not, it will be a huge blessing to her (and it will improve the way the Nursing Home cares for her because they will know you are coming and will see evidence of any lack of care). I would also befriend the staff at the NH and bring them little treats now and then. Appreciation for their care will beget more care. . . and everyone likes to be appreciated. As far as what can help . . . I don't know much about natural remedies . . . someone talked Mom into buying $40/bottle Mangostiene Juice which caused no improvement in ANY of the 3 people in the family who took it religiously for a couple months. As I said before, Mom thought the Ginko Biloba helped Dad's energy level, but make sure you list it with her current meds for ALL her docs. The best medicine I saw was planning activities with Dad. You can take your Gramma for a walk, take her to the park or to go feed the pigeons or the geese . . . take her to watch children play at a playground . . . put together small puzzles at the Nursing Home . . . play with play-doh or clay . . . draw . . . paint . . . any activity engages the brain and helps to delay the atrophy of the brain. Most of all, your presence WILL be a blessing, even when you think she doesn't appreciate it. Dad loved to listen to music and would gladly dance even when he could no longer form an intelligent sentence. Amazingly, he could also show me around on a Map of the World even when he could no longer recognize family members and grandkids. They ALWAYS love what they've always loved . . . so tune in on that early. Oh . . when Dad was really fading, he still enjoyed playing with a balloon. After he could no longer enjoy crafts, or a visit to a golf course . . . I would keep a couple balloons my pocket and I'd blow one up and tie it off and bounce it up a couple times and then send it his way . . . he would act like he didn't want to play, but he could never resist sending it back forth . . . you'll find your own fun activities, but you may have to try several things to find one that's fun for her. Then . . . make sure you come back here and post your successes. Lots of people read here, but they don't post and your successes may help them with their loved ones. I know Lyn will be along to welcome you too!! Keep us posted Darren!! Blessings!


 Hi Darren . . . thanks for the geography lesson . . . I knew that all were part of the UK, but tend to think of the UK as England. . . your explanation is very helpful. Never allow a bit of doubt to stop you from slipping in for a visit. We visit when we can and all our worries about recognition fall away when we arrive. You could visit every day and she may not recognize you sometimes . . . although I was blessed to have Dad light-up most days that I came. He actually enjoyed even strangers . . . he seemed to connect more through their willing smile than any family connection or friendship. So don't be shy of visiting at any opportunity. You will bless her even because the Nursing Home will never know when you might show up and they'll need to make sure she is always ready for a last minute visitor. I hope things work out well for you and your Gramma . . . as I said before it is refreshing and a blessing to see a Grandson who cares enough to seek help for his Gramma. You ARE a blessing to her. . . even when you don't feel like you are. Blessings!


 Darren,,,, Sorry so long to respond my friend Have been rather busy doing things with my Dad who also suffers from this horrid DD My mom passed away March 20 2005 from co/ of and the AD........ There is so many things out there to try to help with the slowing of this DD that it is a great idea to have a neuro assess and then decide with all family or with family that will get together on her Treatment and all docs....what is next for her and for you's all and what meds might be the best to try I believe Aricept is a great one as well as there is Nemanda as Rosie said Once she is in a permanent place she will take some time to calm down and get adjusted to her new suroundings and her new routine ... and Rosie is right VISIT as much as you humanly are able ...you are doing alot and have alot on your plate BUT...she will love and enjoy those visits and YOU will have memories that will never be able to be taken away by anyone........... .some would say she may not realize that you are who you are or even there.....IMHO I truly believe that somewhere deep inside THEY know and feel your presence and your love and caring .......... They are able to feel the vibes if many of the members are disagreeng IMO and will react to that either by totally withdrawing or being combative with some ppl in the NH ( staff and residents) as well as family....... Rosie and I as well as some others did a thread a many moons ago about things to do with them and keep the memories going I will bring it up for you and hopefully it may help some family members as well as give you some ideas for Christmas or other times when you can visit DO not feel guilty ....there is another thread on emotions ppl may go thru also will bumpo that one for you and your family BE proud that you are stepping up as a man and asking questions to help your loved one Sometimes you HAVE to go to their world my friend and YS it can be hard but it is needed.......for them ..... I am so pleased and not at all surprised that you are here for your step grammy and wanting support ideas and input You are truly an asset to HW and I know that I would ( as would others) love to have you in this "" family"" as well .......... As Rosie said we are always here for one another thru the good the bad and the really bad and we look forward to you being here with us my friend...... I am sorry for the reasons as I know from experience what this DD does to many ppl families and of course the ones stricken with it .....they are lost scared and sometimes feel so isolated and alone ....... That I believe is this disease as well .....so many faucets to this Alheimers it is unbelievable at times ...just when you THINK you have a handle on things .....WHAM....something else hits ......... KNOW we are definitely here for you plz STAY with us and read Padraigs thread the first one .......it will give you some insight as to what he has done for G Jean these last yrs and the reason I love him as my mentor and my friend ....... Be well and take care TTY again soon .........LUVS LYN


 Please DO keep us posted my friend.......YOU are part of this family ............... Take care and I know you are not able to visit BUT at least you are getting reports from your mom.......... Luvs LYN


 Darren who has power of attorney over her? The family should step in & take over NOT the friend.It does sound like she has an agenda...........


 I am truly glad Snowy asked the question......... YES I believe the Family needs and should have say in what happens with her ......... Darren is she able to get a phone in her room for incoming calls only ?? That may make her feel a bit better IMHO..................yes it coould be taken a a good sign she is going to nurses station when phone rings BUT on the other hand it may be she is waiting for the calls to come ya know 'and goes down as soon as phone rings and if not for or about her it could lead to some depression ............Just a thought my friend REMEMBER you are family here and we want to know what you and your family are going thru and try to help you out as much as possible ........... Take care and know you are not alone ............LUVS...........LYN Hopefully I am making some sense here........


 Great idea about the phone Lynn and Darren . . . .I never even thought of it because every hospital room I've ever visited has a telephone . . . it is just part of the health system here. Great thought! Glad you are hanging in there Darren!! Blessings!


 Just an update for everyone, Babs has settled well in Scotland and as a result, we have deceided not to move her from where she is as we think it may confuse her even more. Although it means we will only be able to physically see her once or twice a year, we can still phone her whenever we like. As for having a phone in her room, I dont think the home would allow that even though I dont see the harm. Perhaps the cable would be a trip hazard? Thanks for all your support Darren


 Darren I do agree that if your Babs is settling in she should not be moved from there........yes it would cause IMHO more depression and confusion........ I am at a loss as to why the NH would not allow a phone for incoming calls though if it is being paid for and Babs is not able to make outgoing calls .......seems top me it would be beneficial for her ..... and I know here in Ontario they allow it but I guess all NH are different in so their ways ..... Seeing her Biyearly is better than NOT seeing her at all I cannot tell you the sadness and heartbreak I felt when the AD person was placed in a home where I worked and the one I owned that was TOTALLY abandoned by all family ,friends ect......... they do have their feelings still and they sometimes may not know you or others ( example) but they DO still need the visits and company It is quite evident that you and your family do so care about Babs and love her to pieces I am so pleased that you are sharing and getting the support of this family on this forum ....... Plz do keep us posted ....... Luvs LYN


 Not a problem Darren.. we are here for you , your Babs and family anytime....... Luvs LYN


 Take care n post when u need to talk or ask anything my friend k Luvs Lyn


 Hi there everyone, I thought i'd start this with a bit of history... My stepdad's mother has recently been diagnosed with alzheimers disease and I am really confused as to what to expect. I have never had to deal with someone with alzheimers before on a personal level. I used to work in a nursing home when I was 16 (I am 22 now) but I was not really aware of what the individual residents suffered from. At the moment it is just her memory that seems to be affected (She can be violent sometimes as well). There has been some trouble following the death of her husband as to where she will live. She is being pulled in 2 directions... We would like her to live in a secure residential home near us in the south of England as we believe it is in her best interests, but she is being pulled towards Scotland by a family ""friend"" who we believe has a hidden agenda (Although we cannot prove anything.) She is currently in a care home in Scotland after a ""holiday"" ended in a UTI and she was temporarily sectioned under the mental health act for asessment. What i'd like to know is what happens next! I know that nobody has a crystal ball, but what sort of environment is best for her? Her only living family is my step-dad so surely it makes sense for her to be where he can see her regularly, yes? What drugs are out there to help with alzheimers? How does the disease progress and how long does it take? I would be grateful for any help people can give me. Darren


 Hi Rosie, Thank you for taking the time to respond to me. It seems kinna strange asking for help rather than giving it for a change! If her ""friend"" was to take her in Scotland she would get next to no visitors. He is the only one up there reallwho would visit and since he runs a busy farm, I doubt he would manage more than once every couple of weeks. If she was to come to us we would be able to visit 5-6 times a week. (Assuming thats what is in her best interest). As for the timeline, I am glad that the average is 10 years. I understand that averages mean that people live longer and shorter than the average but I was thinking around the 3-5 years mark so I am relieved about that. I know everyone is different but (Generally) is there a longish period of time between where she is now (Memory loss) and her losing other mental functions such as speech? I have heard of Aricept. It was licenced not long ago here in the UK. Her meds have not been sorted out yet, but I want to know if there is anything that I should be on the lookout for (I.e. anything that is not very good or Something that is really helpful). Also any other natural remedies that may help? Can anyone help me? Thanks in advance, Darren


 Hi Rosie, Just clear up a little confusion... Scotland is part of the UK, as is England, Wales and Northern Ireland. She is currently in Scotland but we want her to be in England. For my step-dad, mum and sister it would not be a problem. They live in Gosport where the NH is and visiting is not an issue. For me, its slightly more complicated than that. I am a university student studying in Wales, so I am only in Gosport for 3 weeks at christmas, 3 weeks at easter and 14 weeks in the summer. I would not be able to visit on a regular basis throughout the year and I dont want to confuse her anymore by visiting at Christmas, and then disappearing until easter. Is it better for me to stay away? Is it going to be too confusing for her? I would love to get to know her, but not if it is going to be detremental for her. I will certainly keep people posted of her developments and successes. As you say, it might provide a ray of light for other people as well as giving me a chance to get things off my chest and talk to someone! All the Best Darren


 Thanks for your encouragement. I will let you know how things progess with her and if she is in England when I return home at Christmas, I will definately go and see her.


 Hi Lyn, Thank you so much for your support and for sharing your story. As I think I have mentioned before, it is difficult for me when I am at University, but I speak to my mum on a regular basis to find out how she is doing. Currently, she is in Scotland and is due for re-assessment in 5 weeks time so we are hoping that she can come to stay with us then. I am so grateful that you have all welcomed me into your family and I will keep you posted. Darren


 Hi Guys, My folks have been on the phone to my step-grandma (Babs) and it would appear that she is not settling very well in the NH in Scotland. We didnt think she would anyway, but we are not sure if it is the AzD making her confused or if she really doesnt like it. I suppose if she is still like it in a few weeks time we will know that she isnt happy there. Apparently the staff at the NH say that Babs comes to the office when the phone rings as if she is expecting my mum & step-dad to be on the other end. So she has at least got into her head that we ring regularly. Thats got to be a good sign right? Nothing more to the story really other than she has good days and bad days like so many others do. I doubt much will change in the next 5 weeks or so until we finally decide where she is going to live. Thanks for your on-going support Darren


 I believe the power of attorney is with the solicitors that her husband appointed before he died. After much fighting, Dumfries (A place in Scotland) now have guardianship but not the power of attorney. My step-dad is the only living member of family, but we were not originally allowed to step in. This is why we have been fighting to have some control. We believe that it should be the family that makes the decisions (Or at least has a say in it.) We are getting there slowly though!


 Hi Lyn, I totally understand about the depression thing... that was the first thing that I thought about when I heard that she was doing that. Because not every phone call is going to be for her. Although my mum and step-dad do phone her every night. I never thought about having a phone in her room though! Thats a good thought! I am phoning my mum tonight anyway so I will ask her about that. Other than that, there is no change. Im so glad I have you guys. Your support means the world to me Darren


 I am really happy you will be checking into a phone for her ......I believe it may calm her down even if just a bit .......every bit does help ........ Yes keep us posted my friend ..........


 Darren I was diagnosed very early Alzheimer's 10 yrs ago but last Dec.was rediagnosed with Vascular dementia.I was on aricept for 4 yrs,til it quit working & I've been on razadyne since..... I tried Namenda but I can't take it............. I still do pretty much what I want when I want but I do have days when i'm quite confused.Luckily I have a great hubby who takes up the slack when i need it...... Most all with dementia take an antidepressant to stave off depression.


 Thanks for your support guys. The other advantage to leaving her in Scotland is that her care is partly paid for by the state which would leave more money for her to do other things. If she was to move over the border into England, she would have to be completely self-funding and that would be a real drain. Especially if she has another 20 years in her. Once again, thank you for all your support Darren


 Thanks Lyn. You really are very good to me.


 Hey Darren Just checking in to see how your Babs is doing ........... Hoping all is going well ............... Luvs LYN"
My dads no caregiver,"I am sure lots of people can identify with what I am going thru...I just need to hear from anyone before I explode and say something horrible to my dad, who is my mother's caregiver. My mother is in early stages of alzheimers. My dad is the most negative man I have ever met. My brother and I live 3000 miles away and my sister lives near my mom and dad. My dad is the most negative man I have ever met...oh yeah, I will probably be saying that alot!!!!! I was just visiting them for Xmas and before I left we all met with the doctor and nurse at this big Alzheimer's Center. The nurse and the doctor told my dad that he needs to join a support group. He needs help. He is making my mother worse. He nodded and agreed that some changes have to be made. Unfortunately, he isn't in that place to make those changes. Doesn't like to, won't listen to anyone, never answers your questions with a straight answer...all he does is vent, complain, *****, moan and says, ""you don't know what its like, you're not living with her"". He won't change, adapt or accept. When we agree and try to encourage him to get help, join a support group and just make a list for himself of things to do and then prioritize them, so he is not so overwhelmed...he just ignores our suggestions and goes on *****ing and moaning. I just had a conversation with him. It was horrible. I am angry with his lack of dealing with what is going on with my mother. HOW DARE HE!!!???...but then again, he has always been this way. I try not to react emotionally. I know its going to just get me into trouble. I just don't want to resent him and be so angry with him that I can't talk to him. Oye Vey....","thank you so much for replying. Of course he is in denial. But he is also a man who hates change of any kind. Good or bad. He is also a very negative man. Especially with his family. And now this has been dumped onto him....well, it just brings out the very worst in him. My sister calls me constantly telling me what happened when she was out to dinner with him and my mom...and how nasty he was with my mom. And when she says something my dad just barks, ""Well you don't live with it!"". But he continues not to get help or look into a support group. I told my sister that she has to do it for herself and get her butt in there and get the tools and share the stores that will benefit how she deals with him and my mom. Oye....this is gonna be a long horrible ride, isn't it? I wish I could be there for my mom (geographically) more. Just to share the good things...to offer whatever I can. I am going to a support group on tuesday out here....I just want to get some tools to deal with the dynamic of my dad and sister and mom and the whole poopy thing that AD is giving us.


 Hi there and Welcome to HW I can understand your being so upset and angry at your father right now believe me .....Yet I wonder is this BECAUSE he does not want to ACCEPT the fact that your Mom has this DD?? I ask this as I was the same in some ways with Mom who is now gone and dad always just said it was nothing but now he KNOWS as my step dad ( same man) has Alzheimers as well and he is going thru Hades........I was the caregiver fully for Mom til she passed and am looking after Dad............ All you can do IMHO is be there for MOM and him to a degree .........take into consideration that he wants or is in total denial .........just for a second ...I am not saying this is what it is .....I AM asking IF this could be what it is? Keep making those lists That is a great thing to do and place them where he will see them daily..........many times daily ...put pamphlets all around the house or at least a couple ............there is a book called "" The 36 Hour Day"" I would really suggesst you go to libray or buy it if not have already .......... The resources in yellow at the side may have some info as well to help you out with this YOUR dad has to no matter what come to the realization sooner ( ihope for this) than later she has this DD and will need him more and more You can also have checks done on Caregiver's that can come in for a couple hrs a day ...thru doc and insurance to help out ....... Read thru some of the old threads ...I will bring some up for you that might help I AM glad you posted you needed to get this off your chest ....AD takes so much from us and our loved ones ........ Please stay with us and know you are not ever alone..........My email addy is at the side if you need to email me I am fine with that .......... Gentle Huggs LYN


 There are plenty of tools out there Read some of the posts /threads as well from others here YES it is a bumpy ride ( putting it nicely) BUT you need to focus on your memeories and good times with Mom not what Hades is to come my friend SHE is in there..somewhere believe me ...... I am really and truly sorry that your dad is like this ...he is definitely in denial and Angry ( in Emotions Caregivers and Loved ones go thru thread) ........ Your sis is closer to them she can get ahold of the Local chapter of Alzheimers Society and get plenty of input and resources from there as well .... I will be here for you to support you any time so please feel free to pop in and let me know how things are going okay Gentle huggs and I am so sorry that your sweet Mom has this DD LYN"
Is it possible to be misdiagnosed as having Alzheimer's?,"Hi. My name is Kristin and I'm 38 years old and have Lupus of the central nervous system. Two or so years ago, I came down with severe dementia. I couldn't even remember who my children were at that time and lost them for a year. I think it was a year ago, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and given Aricept. My memory has been getting better but I still get lost on my street sometimes and need to make notes of everything (and then loose the notes). Still it has improved greatly as I can cook, work part-time (it is hard though), clean and care for my children. I can make decisions now but still get real confused, frustrated and anxious if more than one thing needs my attention at any given time. My question is whether or not the doctors could have misdiagnosed me since I am much improved. From what I read Alzheimer's doesn't start quickly then gets better years later. This is confusing to me. That and I am too young for the disease. Was hoping maybe someone could shed some light on what may have happened to me and/or why I am getting better. Should I get retested? I've kind of ignored these questions for a long time because what was going on was scary. I was told I did all these odd things like set the stove on fire, put mail, etc. in the refridgerator, kick people or hide when I was confused, etc. I feel real bad about that and that they had to put up with me and I scared my kids. I don't want it to happen again. So I am hoping to find a more logical answer for what is going on. I would appreciate any thoughts you may have. This is a very upsetting thing for me to talk about still. Thanks - Kristin","Thanks Lyn, I will try to get that done. It did seem odd to me. Any ideas on what they should be looking for or the tests I could request? All I remember is a neuropsych test, but have been told I had other tests done at that time. Don't know what doctor I saw or what tests though. God bless you too - Kristin


 Have you read Snowys thread on "" retesting "" yet Kris ?? How are you doing LYN


 I am hoping you have been retested and find that it is NOT AD you are suffering from but it has to do with the other DD Lupus ............ I am also finding issues myself with fog and forgetting with my short term memory of which I never ever had a problem with before ' Keep us posted please Kris THanks BC for your invaluable input LYN


 Welcome Goldilocks and you are so right about the H.E. Thanks for your input and I do hope you will become active in this forum Take care LYN


 Yes you should and NEED to be retested your feelings on this I believe is stright on Keep us posted please I am sorry for what you are going thru hun BUT like I said retest asap God Bless you LYN ** email me if you would like info at side **


 I will bring to the top Snowys retesting thread and that should help or I am sure she will post on this thread hun No problem any time Many ppl are being mis DX with AD and it is not that at all ....... God Bless I wish you all the best Keep coming back here k and get the support you DO need right now LYN


 Hi Kristin, YES, CNS lupus definitely can cause everything you describe. I have watched my daughter, who has this type of lupus have significant cognitive decline and memory loss. She has problems with reading comprehension and doing any complex tasks, plus being forgetful and losing things. She has had lupus for over 20 years, since teen years and takes Cellcept, Plaquenil, and 5mg. prednisone. She just started taking Provigil, which has really helped her to focus, but now we find that the insurance is denying coverage (Medicare part D & medicaid). I am trying to find if any of the different drug ins. plans will cover this important drug, as it really helps with the lupus fatigue and brain fog issues. You should definitely be retested......it does not sound like alzheimers, but more like central nervous system lupus. Good luck with your treatment and recovery.


 Yes, it is absolutely possible to be misdiagnosed with early onset Alzheimers. Please see the note regarding Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (not to be confused with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.) Many neurologists don't even know what H.E. is, but they can certainly find out and test you for it."
Research noted by John Hopkins,"Hope I'm not violating any copyright. The folowing is from an e-mail service from John Hopkins. Mary Memory Special Report The Role of Insulin in the Development of Alzheimer’s Disease Recent research suggests that a failure in insulin processing in the brain may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Dr. Sam Grandy, Chair of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the Alzheimer’s Association, talks about this intriguing new insight. Researchers are getting closer to understanding how Alzheimer’s disease develops, and a key component in several emerging theories is insulin and its role in the brain. One reason uncovering the role of insulin in Alzheimer’s disease is so exciting is because drugs already exist to treat insulin deficiency in diabetes. These drugs might be used “as is” to treat Alzheimer’s disease, but even if they aren’t, they give researchers a head start. Insulin does the important job of guiding the entry of glucose, the body’s main energy source, into cells. When insulin is deficient or the body fails to respond to it, as is the case with diabetes, small blood vessels are damaged from the excess glucose present in the bloodstream, and cells are damaged because they are cut off from their fuel supply. Glucose is so important to brain cells that they don’t need insulin to absorb sugar. But some brain cells have insulin receptors and require insulin to spur them into action. Sam Gandy, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Farber Institute for Neurosciences at Thomas Jefferson University and Chair, Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the Alzheimer’s Association, explains, “The role of insulin in the brain is different from its role in the rest of the body. In the brain, insulin helps nerve cells communicate. Insulin acts as the ‘accelerator’ on the nerve cell, revving up cell metabolism.” It has been suggested that a failure in insulin processing in the brain may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Dr. Gandy is quick to point out that Alzheimer’s disease is not a form of diabetes. The important distinction between what insulin does in the brain and what insulin does in the rest of the body underscores the finding, made by researchers at Rhode Island Hospital (RIH), that deterioration caused by insulin dysfunction in the brain is independent of whether a person has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. RIH researchers compared brain tissue from 45 people who died in various stages of Alzheimer’s disease with brain tissue from people with no history of Alzheimer’s disease and found that insulin levels fell in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and continued to fall as the disease progressed. In the most advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease, the cell receptors that process insulin were functioning at an 80% lower capacity than the receptors in healthy brain tissue. In a 2005 study reported in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, the same researchers injected the brains of rats with streptozotocin, a chemical compound that impairs insulin production. Examination revealed the characteristic signs of Alzheimer’s disease in the rats’ brains, including amyloid plaques, low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and abnormal tau protein formation. It has long been known that positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brains of people with Alzheimer’s show a dramatic decrease in sugar utilization. Says Dr. Gandy, “In people who are at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, somewhere along the road to developing dementia, their sugar utilization changes. What’s not known is whether sugar utilization changes before or after people develop the symptoms of dementia and the structural changes such as beta-amyloid plaques.” The National Institutes of Health is currently enrolling participants in The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to “try to establish the temporal sequence of brain changes in people with Alzheimer’s,” continues Dr. Gandy. In addition to charting insulin changes, very sensitive neuroimaging tests are measuring minute structural changes, which may mark an early stage of clinical dementia. On the horizon -- “Now that we think we understand how Alzheimer’s disease begins,” says Dr. Gandy, “the challenge is to find out when it begins and when we would have to start treating it to have effect. More research needs to be done and then we can begin the extended process of developing compounds that work first in test tubes, then in animals, and then in people.” The theory that problems with insulin develop before structural changes in the brain and symptoms of dementia take place is already being put to the test with thiazolidinediones (TZDs), drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. These drugs, which include Avandia (rosiglitazone) and Actos (pioglitazone), do the job of insulin when insulin can’t. Recent studies with rosiglitazone suggest that, in addition to helping the body metabolize glucose, TZDs help normalize the brain cell signals that require insulin. Researchers at RIH have tested TZDs and similar compounds in rats injected with streptozotocin and found similar effects. In fact, many of the abnormalities associated with Alzheimer’s disease were reduced after treatment. Studies also are following people taking TZDs to treat their type 2 diabetes to see if the drugs have any influence over the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. One study following 142,328 veterans with diabetes found 20% fewer new cases of Alzheimer’s disease among those treated with TZDs compared with veterans taking insulin or other types of diabetes drugs. The ADNI will finish enrollment in the next few months and begin monitoring participants periodically for a 3- to 5-year period -- possibly longer. “It’s the largest systematic and organized approach to the question of what happens first that’s ever been taken,” says Dr. Gandy. In the past, studies have followed people with dementia. “We’ll be looking at people with and without dementia, between the ages of 70 and 90, over their lifespan, to see what happens along the road from aging to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Knowing what happens first,” Dr. Gandy states, “is the key to Alzheimer’s disease prevention.” Medical Disclaimer: This information is not intended to substitute for the advice of a physician.

My Moms current stage - anyone have this situation??,"Trying to figure out if this is a stage/state of alzheimers or not... Really hard when you cannot communicate with your loved one, but, was hoping maybe someone else is experiencing this... My Mom just keeps screaming... It is at a steady pace, like timed and constant. We were able to get her to stop before by holding her hand or gently massaging her forehead. Or, I would just say MOM! real loud and she would look at me and stop, then start again. Now, tonight she just keeps screaming. No matter what we do or say, she just keeps it up. The nurse gave her a pain pill in case she is in pain, which should have helped but and hour and a half later she was the same, just screaming. They drew blood from her hand for blood tests, she kept screaming at the same pace almost as if she is in a locked state of mind (or mouth). Then the doctor ordered a pain patch, but, no change. We just want her to be at peace, be able to sleep and rest, but in this state that is impossible.... Why do we allow them to suffer so much??? We show more empathy for animals.... This disease is so dam sad and heartbreaking.......... the long goodbye. Thank you for any ideas or info to help my Mom Doreen","SnowLynne She is in a nursing home where they have Doctors on their panel. When they go to the nursing home to check the patients we are not informed. All responses are handled by the nurses. My Sister went above heads and called the doctors directly yesturday, the main one was the psychiatrist to ask if he could put her back on an anti-depressant - he scolded her for calling him and going outside the normal protocol of the nurses only calling. He said he could not do anything without seeing her and speaking with the primary care doctor. The primary care doctor does not return the calls. Only speaks thru the nurses. We cannot remove her from the nursing home as she cannot walk anymore. She had 2 TIA's in August and went downhill after that, then she had another seizure that lasted about 3 minutes Thursday at about 3 AM. Since then, she does not stop screaming. As far as a neurologist, I do not think one has seen her recently. That I will take up with the nurses and see if it is possible. Hard to diagnose her since we cannot speak with her or get an answer from her if we ask a questions. I hate this dam disease and what it has done to her. Scary thing - she had 9 sisters - including her, 4 of them have been diagnosed with AD, one of them passed away 2 years ago. Thank you Doreen


 Lyn, My Mom has been on aricept and another AD medication for years now. She was doing fantastic until December 26th 2006 when she fell at the nursing home. She loved to walk and would walk thru all the hallways to visit everyone,a very loving woman. If there were people to see and talk to, music playing - she was happy. She loved to sing, dance and smile (and flirt with the men). Then she fell...she became very combative, cursing, spitting, pinching, biting - you name it. They then had to send her to a ""crisis center"" which was basically for drunks, drug addicts etc., at a local hospital. That was New Years weekend of 2006. We stayed with her and did everything to keep her calm, but, she even fought my sister and I. They had her strapped down arms, legs, etc. It was horrible. Finally they got her stabilized and returned to the nursing home . But she was never the same. We had all tests run, even thought maybe she had had a stroke, but, all results of tests came back negative. They kept her on antidepressants, her AD meds, sinus meds.. then slowly started to take her off of the anti depressants, etc. But stayed with the AD Meds (they wanted her off of that too, but we refused). Then in August she had a few mini strokes and slipped further away. She cannot communicate with us, she is bedridden now, cannot walk or sit up. Her hands are kept in fists, closed up and if we try to open her hands to trim her nails she would scream in pain. Now, it is just screaming. The only reason we think it may be due to some type of pain is because when the medication finally kicked in and she was dozing off, the screaming turned into the words.... ow, ow, ow, ow (very gently and quietly). So, we are assuming she is in some type of pain.... Right now she is on a low dose of darvocet, a pain patch, aricept and thats it. They are waiting to see if that helps, she has quieted down, but that is because she is sleeping. If the pain meds do not seem to ease her screaming, etc., then the psychiatrist will examine her sometime next week to see what he feels it is. Just want her to be at peace....... Doreen


 SnowyLynne My sister has full POA ... which is good - she is single and self employed therefore has more time to handle all of this, very meticulous and honestly does everything possible for my Mother. This is the 4th nursing home she has been in and honestly she is kept very clean, her room is spotless and the staff is more receptive to her needs as well as ours for her. The last Nursing home she was in was a nightmare and all the complaints fell on deaf ears within the home, finally we got her out of there. (Just saw this nursing home on the feds recent list of the 52 worst nursing homes in the USA)(This was the only one on the list for New Jersey).... We do keep up with her meds, in fact just had a care meeting for her this past Tuesday to go over everything. Now we are requesting her to be placed back on the antidepressants, but, as I explained it has to be okayed by the staff physician and psychiatrist. She has been in and out of hospitals so much this past year which each time is very traumatic for her. The only way a neurological exam would really do any good ( i think) is if they could speak with her. She has had all the MRI's, Cat Scans blood tests, xrays etc.... I trust my sister to the max, of course we have disagreements on certain care things, which is normal, but honestly if I were ill, I would want her to be my responsible care person. Doreen


 Lyne, thanks for your caring and questions.... It is very difficult as all of us know with loved ones with Alzheimers..... I honestly think we are losing her. It is hard, but, in reality we lost her a long time ago, right?? To see her go on like this is heartbreaking, for us and very sad for her. She is still yelling or screaming out. Nurse said she fought them when they tried to feed her. Usually, everytime she opens her mouth to yell, they put a spoonful of food in her mouth. This way she eats all her food (all soft of course) and gets the nourishment she needs. However, tonite she didnt want the food. She is quiet and resting now, that is the main thing... I guess. Thank you again, Doreen


 Lynne Thank you for your reply and your suggestions.... It is so difficult to see our parent(s) suffer this way. I am so sorry that both of your parents have been hit with AD, that is even more difficult. My ""me"" time is on the computer. I work full time, and right now it is even more stressful as the owner/president of the company (very small one) passed away on Nov. 9, 2007 after a short illness, so everything is changing there and the other 2 people who I work with in the office do not like the changes, so they keep fighting and complaining. And me, I am just thankful to have full time job and be making a paycheck. We do not know how long that will last with all the problems with the mortgage industry, but, we are fighting to keep going (me and the 2 full time appraisers that it).... Plus, trying to help out my late bosses wife with all the changes, etc. Plus, I have 2 daughters and am a single (divorced) Mom. However, I know what my Mom is going thru within herself is worse than all of that put together plus...... Unfortunately, I think what happens with these doctors who take care of elderly patients with different diseases that are not curable, is that they have to put up a wall in order to block out all the suffering and eventual passing on. They get that wall up so high and thick that they lose all compassion for the patient and their family, which is not really fair to anyone. My Mom's physician (thru the Nursing Home) is like that.... He gets you so mad..... As he states ""we don't really know if she had a siezure or what was going on, the only way to know that is to put her in the hospital for tests"". or ----- when we ask if (in his opinion) he feels we are doing everything we can for her, to keep her comfortable, etc."" his response ""we have been all thru this conversation before"". Now, tell me, what kind of answer is that?? I went to see her tonight, it is obvious she did have some type of siezure or TIA - her right eye doesn't open all the way. If I try to hold her hand or touch her gently, she yells out. Even if I try to sit on the end of the bed just to be close to her, she yells out as if I am hurting her..... However, she is eating (hand fed) 100% of her meals (all soft foods) - so that is good..... What answers are there?? Every AD patient is so different, how do you know if what you are doing is right or wrong??? Thanks again, Doreen


 Lyne, she was brought to the crisis center at the hospital because she was violent. She was biting, pinching, spitting and hitting the aides and nurses. Even cursing them out. The aides were concerned because she would run from them and they were afraid she was going to fall again and break a hip, bone, etc... She became violent AFTER she had fallen in one of the other residents room. They found her there and from that moment on it was as if someone else took over her. She was always gentle, loving, laughing and wanting to just walk the halls all day visiting people (one nurse wanted to put a pedometer on her to see how many miles she actually walked) Walking was her way of life, she never drove a car, always walked or took local buses, but, mainly walked - no matter how cold it was outside, snow storms, rain, thunder, heat and humidity she always loved to walk. They had to restrain her when the EMT's came to get her to transport her to the hospital, even then, she tried to pitch, hit them etc. My Mother was never, ever like that. We were with her for the entire time she was at the crisis center. It went in between the Emergency room bays and the crisis area. But, she was not left alone there. Between my Sister and I we stayed by her side. So, nothing happened to her while she was there, it was prior to her arriving. Thank you again Doreen


 Sounds like you may need a dr thats schooled in Alzheimers or dementia.Does she have a Neurologist?


 Welcome Doreen I totally agree with Snowy she does need to see a neuro and find out exactly what she has got going on .............. Another question....why pain meds has she had past injuries...........and is she on any calming meds or ad meds at all ?? Please do stay with us and know we are here for you and your mom.........I lost mom awhile back and now look after my dad with the same DD that yes it is a robber of our loved ones ............ Be well and hang in there........God Bless LYN


 Do you have POA? If so you do have control over the situation,or you can move her to a more acceptable place of your choosing..............What medications Is she on?You can have a say in that too.


 Doreen IMHO It sounds like your sister's circumstances and behaviuor changed with the "" crisis centre"" Why they would put her with drunks and addicts is beyond me and I am positive it has had a lasting effect on her .........But thats my opinon..... There is thread here on the Nursing homes and care/ quality or lack of I am glad she has settled but In all honesty because she no longer screams as though she is in pain and is only saying ow ow ow aftr pain meds given that doesnt nesessarily mean she has pain or is screaming about pain........IMHO.....Just my opinion........ It could just mean she is drugged up enough not to scream all the time .... I am glad she may be seeing a pysch or therapist to find out what the root cause is and I do hope you will continue to post and let us know what is going on with her Stay with us plz **Remember these are my opinions only**............LYN


 HI Doreen Am glad she is eating and I wish there was a better way to have her eat in all honesty BUT like you said she is getting nourishment this way......... Although Dad is basically gone he is still with me and I talk to him and he responds to many different stimuli Do not get into the mindset she is gone hun ......IMHO she knows you are there and she knows you love her ....no matter what the mind has done from this DD.......... The "" stages"" are all differnt as far as i am concerned I worked for many yrs in Nursing homes and had my own until I got to sick to kep it going Mom was okay one moment and then wham it hit her like a ton of bricks ......... Dad he is okay to a point and is taking Nemada I think with Mom it was C/o of pnuemonia nd the AD With dad it will be from a broken heart it has not been to long since we lost her and I do alot of thinking and crying missing her even with the Ad taken over her ya know........Dad calls me Judy ( her name) and I do look the most like her I am sure this has alot to do with his confusion about whether she is here or not .... I am glad your Mom is resting hun and I do know for one thing YOU need to look after yourself as well as you are no good to her if you are down sick .........And you need "" me"" time .......even if just a hot tubby with candles each night ...it helps and So does knowing you are doing all your BEST to make sure she is okay ........ Keep posting hun and I will keep you and your mom in my heart thoughts and prayers Luvs God Bless LYN.


 Doreen ........you really dont know except in your heart and i know in my heart YOU are doing all you are able to do for her right now and yes keep at the doc's.....I keep coming back to the "" crisis centre"" and what may have triggerd something in your Mom to be acting like this ........the yelling ... . I honestly wish there was a way we could find out what this is caused by I am so bleeding lucky to have a doc that LISTENS and has empathy .........a long ago emotion they use to all have IMHO.......and desperately need to re educate themselves on .......... Be well sweetie and know I am here as are others Luvs Lyn.


 Thanks for sharing all of that Doreen.... I just have no clue what would make her go off this way and I wish I did have some way to help you's figure it out' It has to be so danged hard to watch and see her change from what she was to what she is now ........ What about medications .I know she is on Aricept and AD's but what AD's if you dont mind me asking ?? I am keeping you and her in my thoughts and prayers for sure LYN"
Please help me - long story - sorry,"Hi everyone Well where do i start, basically i left home 3 yrs ago, family didnt agree with my choice of husband, therefore i was disowned by the family. My mum was ill at the the time, doctors didnt know what was wrong with my mother, some said it was alzheimers diesease, and others disagreed, as my mother was young, in her 40s. I tried to explain to my mother that i was going to leave and get married, my mother seemed to be ok with it, but after 5 minutes would not be able to recall the conversation we had. Well after getting married, i went to my family home, only to get the door slammed in my face, by relatives, and did not allow me to see my mother. My husband also tried to reason with them, but had no joy. Since the time i have left home, i have had two children and my mother has not seen them, due to me disowned by the family. I have tried so much, but feel now to go the legal way, as i believe it is my only choice. But, recently i found out my mother was in hospital, and i went to see her, my relatives where there, but did not speak to me. I feel so bad, as my mother has changed so much, the last time i saw her was in 2005. My mum got happy and started to laugh, but could not talk, but then it sounded like she was crying, i was not sure if i was upsetting her. Once i left the hospital, i started to receive phone calls and messgaes, stating that i was stupid, and i should of not gone to the hospital, and that no one wanted me there. Well i did go back and luckly no-one was there, i just started to talk to my mother, and it felt so nice, she was laughing, which made me happy. She was really concentrating on what i was saying. The lady on the ward stated how happy my mother was to see me, it seemed like my mother was trying to talk to me. I spoke to the doctors and he advised me my mother has cerebral amyloid, which looking on the internet it states it is linked to alzheimers. The only problem is, my mother will be going home soon, and i know if i go back to my family home, they will not allow me to see my mother. What do i do? Di i take the legal route? I do not want to upset anyone, but i am sure my mother was happy to see after a long time, in my head it seemed she knew who i was, even though she could not talk to me, i feel we still had a connection. Please help, with any advice, thanks Sorry for being soo long","Hi Little Miss, I find it so sad that you find yourself in this sorry mess. Why oh why can't people see that the most important person here is your Mum. Can't they see, you are of her flesh and for her sake they should be bending over backwards to remove any bad feelings. Often I read people becoming upset when they see their loved ones crying. Why can't they see it's their way of showing that they are overwhelmed with joy finding someone cares? If your family are so blind as not to see they are hurting your Mum by keeping you and your children away, then for both you and your Mum's sake, I'd do whatever it takes to give her some of your time. It matters little whether she can speak or not, she will be able to read what your eyes and face say. To feel your touch can cheer her up no end. As for your family, one thing you'll have learned is, that when the time comes you'll let your kids make their own mistakes, then you'll be there for them when things go wrong. They, on the other hand I hope don't live to regret denying your Mum the love of a daughter and the sight of her grandchildren. What comes around goes around. Please God they see sense and make up, time is so precious to waste it being stupid. My best wishes to you. You have only one Mum, go share time with her. May your God go with you. Padraig


 I do hope you will do everything within your power plus to see your mom and make those memories and make up for so much time lost Thanks Granpa for your support Kitt you too Luvs Lyn Big sis

 DO not let your sister bully you YOU have all the right to see your Mom and of COURSE you did nothing to make your mom ill so do not feel any guilt ..let your sister be angray and bitter it seems it is her way to get thru life If you have to go to court so be it ...ANYTHING to have your mom is how I feel ......I wish Mom was here for me at this time I am fighting with my siblings over putting Dad in a home and I will not relent ....I have looked after him and Mom when she was alive for more than 10 yrs I am not about to give up and in now especially since Monetary issues play a huge role in their wanting him in a home Keep me posted and Have a great visit ..... God Bless LYN ** BTW you are not causing this trouble she and others are you want and NEED to have a relationship with your Mother you and your Mom do deserve this Fight hun ......fight


 I agree do NOT let them bully you.They are the ones who need a slap up side the head to wake them up.

 Hello Little Miss, There would never be a reason I would not want to see my daughter so speaking as a Mom, you do whatever it takes to visit your Mom. What a sad waste of time and energy spent on trying to keep two people apart, a Mother and her daughter. I am glad you are doing this for both of you. God Bless Kitt


 hi everyone, i just wanted to say thankyou for all your kind words and support. I went to see my mother again, and my gran was there, she wasn't impressed seeing me. I feel really uncomfortable when she is there, as i am unable to talk to my mother freely, but i showed my mother pictures, of my little family, shes a grandma, to a little devil she will be turning 2, and my little girl who is 5 weeks old. She started laughing when looking at the pictures. My gran just ignored me, which didn't really bother me, as i was there just to see my mother. I am going to speak to the doctor about my mother conditions, as i feel i have a right to know, i don't feel comfortable asking my gran. I went again in the evening, and it was just me and my mother, i was talking about random things, and she laughed. My mother only has two reactions, to what i have seen, she either laughs, or crys (sounds like a whale , only way to explain it). But when she did cry, i would tell her to stop, and said ""you can't be angry at me"", and she started to laugh. I feel that she was trying to talk to me, but got really frustrated, or she wanted to smack me around my face, and say ""why did you leave"". Her eyes, were crying, but there were no tears, i want to cry but for some reason i am not. Its horrible to know that when i left in 2005, i could to speak to my mum, even thou she was forgetful, and got frustrated when she couldn't get her point across, but we could communicate. I never thought, that she would lose her speech, the thing that would go through my mind, is my mother would not remember me. Its hard to see her, she is bed bound, and has a food drip, and hardly any movement, due to a stoke, but today she squeezed my hand. I have no idea, how long my mother will be in this world, to be honest i really do not know much at all. I feel that my family are not thinking of my mother, as a mother myself, i would always want my children to be there, even if they did do something wrong and if i didn't agree.At the end of the day they are still my children. I am so upset, and feel lonely, i still love my sister, but have gone to hate her, i feel my mother is slowly slipping away, and my sister can not put our differences aside for the stake of our mother. Lately my worse fears are if i get the same, i couldn't put my family through the same pain, my mother is only 46, what life has she had. So sorry, getting upset, but still no tears, its nice writing down my feelings, i don't really talk about my mother, not alot my friends or husband family know about my mother as i am a very private person. But it feels good, telling someone straight, about my pain and worries. Will keep you posted. Ps Spoke to someone, in regards to a legal order, and i will be receiving a form, i thinks it is the power of protection, or court of protection, so once i get that will fill it in and post it asap.


 Hi Thanks for the reply, much appreciated. I know i shouldn't use the hate word, but my sister is truly forcing me in that direction. The other day, i received a private phone call, but hubbi answered it. It was my sister, she was telling him, that i caused my mum condition, and that i am not welcome in the family. She also insisted that me coming to the hospital, had resulted in my mother having fits. This was untrue, as when i spoke to the doctor he had advised that my mother did have a fit, but that was before i had even visted her at the hospital. My sister then started to say, that she is going to get an injunction against me, from seeing my mother, and she is happy to go to court. All my sister wants to do is fight, i don't want any trouble, all i want is to see my mum, whilst she is still here. I feel upset, as i don't want to cause any pain or upset, and i truely do not want to go to court, but i see as my only option. Going to see mum tomorrow, so will update you. Bye


 wow..... I cannot describe how I feel reading all of this. First off I wold like to say I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I don't know the feeling of being a mother nor losing one but I can only imagine the pain you must go through. Secondly, what is your family's problem? I mean dishoning you and then when your mother probably doesn't have much longer to live stil don't want you to visit her??!? If that was my mom I wouldnt care if I was disowned or not. I would spend every waking moment with my mom. Trying to spend as much time with her as I can before she leaves this life. You are right to take legal action. And I agree with Lynn. DO NO let your sister bully you. There is no possibl way you have cause anything to your mother. I cannot believe your sister would be that cold hearted to say. Im sorry... im being mean now arent I? Sorry.


 LOL..Meet our Snowy ........very blunt and very truthful ........ I am so glad she did respond as aperson who does know first hand of this DD........ This is truly a sad situation in all and I can empathize to a point ...am having much problems with siblings wanting to place Dad in a home and I took the "" NOT gonna BULLY me "" way ...... Please keep seeeing your Mom or I promise you will reget it if you dont for the rest of your life ....... Keep us posted God Bless LYN * Thanks PBG for your input NO you are not being mean just feeling the pain of this poster IMHO..... Luvs LYN"
Our prayers are with Padraig after losing his dear Jean.,"Dear Padraig, I know I am but one of many in the HW family who grieve with you and for you. Your love story with Jean is so powerful and it has been an honor for me to be allowed into some parts of your life, to read of your love, your commitment, dedication and respect for your Jean. I feel as though, through your words, I have gotten to know her a little and so much about your life prior to and then after meeting your true love. I share your sorrow, your loss of your wonderful wife. You always write how she saved you from a life void of love and the ability to love back. You, my dear friend, saved her also. You kept her out of a system of care that could not possibly give her what you knew, from your heart, that she needed. Only someone who knew her as well as you could provide the kind of loving care you gave her for so many years. I am so sorry, Padraig, that she had to leave you. As much as she was and will continue to be your angel, you were and will continue to be hers. With love and deep regards, Linda","Oh Padraig.. what to say at a time like this..

Try to stay strong...as there are many people on this board who love and care about you so much. Wishing you the best sweetie!


 Padraig, from your words, we felt the love you had for Jean and we share in your sorrow. Please accept my condolences on the loss of your beloved wife Jean, and know she is your angel watching over you.


 I am so sorry for your loss. May the joyful memories you have help you through this rough time.


 Dear Padraig, I am thinking of you and praying for you. May God light your way and give you comfort. Gentle Hugs Kitt


 Padraig, so sorry about the loss of your beloved wife. My thoughts and prayers will be with you.


 Dear Padraig, I wouldn't be surprised if you have not been checking the HW site these last several days. I do want you to know, though, that you are being thought of every moment of the day, that I am asking for healing and a measure of comfort for you, and for you to remember what a gift you gave your lovely Jean. I was just reading the words you wrote in my copy of your book: that I had brought a ray of sunshine and happiness to my parents, and that my love and care was a gift beyond measure. The same is for you, Padraig. You brought a quality to Jean's life that would only have been possible with your own care of her. You showed her your love through every action, every minute of every day. You brought her the light of day, the kind of light only real love brings. And you gave her a gift beyond measure. She loved you dearly, as all your stories show so clearly and intimately. What a blessed woman she was to have ""rescued"" you, as you so often put it. And what a blessed man that you could ""rescue"" her right back. You could not have given more and she knew that. She was loved and treasured, the very best gift of all. Please take care of yourself and know that your well-being is important to all of us. No one can lift the grief from your heart, the heaviness of loss. We can, though, send you all the best thoughts, prayers, and words of condolence. Hold tight to your family, you will all need each other and will be able to help each other. Because Jean touched the lives of so many people, there are that many people and many, many more who grieve with you, wishing we could bear some of the grief for you. I wish you peaceful thoughts, warm memories, and family unity at this time. Fondly, Linda


 Praying and thinking of you G Padraig .......... God Bless Butterfly Kisses Love LYN


 Dear Padraig, Lyn, Linda and all Caretakers, It's Chrstmas Eve day here in Canada, Padraig, and I wish all of you a blessed Christmas. What a lot we've been through together. May peace and love be in our hearts and may we take comfort that we have done, and continue to do, our best. That we know about each other. We know because we've walked this road side by side, heart beat by heart beat. Mary


 Thank you, Mary, for those nice words. They are so true, it's comforting to think about , and it is especially good knowing there are so many of us that truly care about each other, having been let into some of each others most personal moments. Christmas Eve here in Oregon. I traveled here from my home in eastern Oregon where there was about 9 inches of snow, just to hopefully start some new traditions. It will be memorable, that is for sure: sever storms have battered this part of the coast, leaving quite a bit of damage and within the last 2 hours we have received notification that more is coming!! Emergency kits have been distributed, with candles, matches, flashlights, and several free tokens to the vending machines! I'm not too concerned, just cautious. However I did make a quick run to a local grocery to get bottled water, more batteries for my flashlight, some protein rich food that does not require refrigeration, several bags of ice for my ice chest, and of course lots of chocolate ( 1/2 price Christmas candy sale!), and ridiculously rich microwave popcorn that I am going to pop in advance, and I also filled the car with gas. Sweet thoughts to all of you, and thank you all for being here. I feel as though you are all really wonderful people, and it has been a gift to have you in my life. So tonight we we all weather our own kinds of storms...................... peace and warm thoughts to each and every one of you. P.S. Because my granddaughter (5 yrs. old) was going to be here all day with my son, I packed my large, but portable keyboard so that I could play and she could sing Christmas songs with me. We had lots of listeners, lots of applause, and a good time. Linda


 Thinking of you G Padraig ....... Love Butterfly Kisses and God Bless LYN"
Update on my grandma and some questions,"I called my gmas family doc (first) and explained to him what was going with her, so I tricked her into going for a routine physical. She would never have gone if I told her it was to check her mental status. Anyway, he wasn't 100% that she has AD. He did state that she may be experiencing some sort of dementia - but the possibility of AD is still there. Some more testing has to be done. She does exhibit signs of sundowners and from what I read, this can be an early indication of AD? So anyway, here are my questions. I'm trying to understand her behavior - if a such thing can happen! But she is highly secretive when she gets something to eat. I have told her numerous times that she doesn't have to hide what she is getting out of the cupboard because our food is her food. She will take cookies out of the cupboard and when I walk into the kitchen, she quickly puts it back like she was doing something wrong. Plus, I have found cookies with one bite out of them and then they're put back. Any ideas on how to handle that? Also, her temper gets short with my husband and my daughter. This makes my hubby feel sort of bad, like he's doing something wrong and I won't even start on with my daughter. I'm a constant referee between gma and my daughter. My daughter is 12 and no matter what, she seems to not be able to do anything right by my gma though she tries! She has since become immune to her antics since I've explained to her to not take it personally. My son and I can do no wrong in her eyes but I'm tired of being the referee. I guess this wasn't so much a question but a vent!","That's a great idea Lyn. Thank you! I'm sure if I got my daughter to do more with gma that it might turn the tables for her. Of course, trying to get a self centered preteen to think of anyone but herself it a bit of a challenge too! :) But I like the idea of the cookie gathering. It is sort of funny actually - my hubby will go into the cupboard and say ""Whoops, gma was in the cookies again!"" I know what you mean about a nursing home. I wouldn't do that to gma too unless it was absolutely necessary. Like if she was unable to control her bodily functions anymore or wandering off - then and only then would I consider a home. I would feel absolutely horrible though if it came down to that. I'm pretty much all she has and she just sings the praises to anyone that will listen on how good I am to her. I feel as if she put me on a pedastal I now I'm afraid of falling off it if you know what I mean? But I'm sure as she progresses to the worse (if she does) that I may have more questions as to how to deal with it. I'm in new territory here!


 How is it going Red did the trick work with your daughtwer and GMom......... Keep me posted plz In Friendship Luvs LYN


 LOL Well keep me posted 'I have Dad here so siblings cannot get to him and then I make sure he is all tucked in and comfy ....then do threads ..its sure has changed my routine .....BUT I will get thru it as long as I dont have to face siblings and perhaps choke one of them lol Take care In friendship Lyn


 Hi Red Yes Sundowning can be the beeginnings of AD..My dad has the sundowning As for the food many AD pple will do that they sneak the food for whatever the reason and if caught quickly put it back .Taking one bite and putting it back sounds funny but I know it is a cause for concern Personally I would take all the ones she has biten out of and put them on a plate with some wrap and set in her room....as well as couple of other cookies ......perhaps if you put alil snack plate in her room nightly she will enjoy that Maybe instead of her thinking your daughter is bad or whatever you might have your daughter set it in there while she is in the room"" Here's some cookies GMA kinda thing Mom was like that with Cait and I put it down to the fact that she saw so much of Cait in me ya know the good and the bad lol..... It is not an easy job you are doing but you are doing great IMHO ......... I hope I have been of some help and I know that you need to vent believe me .I have my siblings all up in my face to put dad in a home .NOT in my lifetime Take care and try this hoping it will work for you's LYN


 LOL i have ateen too Red so I hear ya BUT oddly enough Cait LIKES to do things for Poppa..........go figure She makes his lil snack plates up and they chat about the ""Old Days "" and Cait reads to him he loves it Ya Dad has me way up there too I know how ya feel its along way to the floor But not to worry we will not crash we will help one another thru this hun k ANYTIME..........I am here for you Luvs LYN


 Lol well, my daughter hasn't been home all weekend. She's been at friends houses so we will see when I can get her to stay home. We have a 3 day weekend here in the states due to Martin Luther King Jr.s bday so of course she's been taking advantage of it!"
what to do?,"Hello everyone, This year for me is not going by fast enough with everything that has happened. My nana is stable and being kept comfortable. The NH is getting her a ""hospice bed"", not really sure what that is, maybe just more comfy. Today when I called my job to let them know dates of dr appts I have in Sept since the schedule is made up the month before I wanted them to know my conflicts which they have been good about in the past remicade etc. I was informed that due to my limitations I will have (only limitations would be until Sept 20th then back to full duties) to find employment elsewhere. They said that they are fully staffed this after asking me earlier in the week for a letter from my Dr listing my limitations...I told them about the 20 lb weight limit and the no mopping or vacuuming the animal hospital for a few weeks. I applied for unemployment today online and I have to call them tomorrow to inform them that I am still getting TDI but just til the end of August this way they dont somehow overlap payment. My nan is still not doing well she was placed on Hospice and they figure she wont be with us much longer maybe a week or 2. With my papa finally realizing my nan wont be going home and that she maybe has 2 weeks left he actually mentioned to my folks about Eric and I moving in with him. At first I was like no way he will be 80 and we are still newlyweds. Eric called me from work and it does make sense to move in there it is a 3 story cape house (1 family) with a 2 car garage detached on 1/4 or 1/2 acre ( i cant remeber which) and this happened before the work thing. This would give him company, we could split utilities, we wouldnt have rent to pay ...right now we pay 775 and my dresser cannot fit in out bedroom with our full size bed. We would definitly want cable and internet and this house would need to be wired for that which he and I would take care of 100% and papa would get cable free on his tvs too since we get digital cable. The floor plan is pretty spacious the basement has 2 rooms one half is where the boiler, washer/dryer, cedar closet, and shelving units are. The other half of the basement (actually still has lots of my stuff in those plastic bins from when my ex and I got divorced and I moved out and had lots of stuff and no where to put it besides there. This room has a tile floor (there is a subpump down there due to some minimal flooding with severe storms) it is a large open room which is like a family room. It has a bar and the 1/2 bath. The main floor has 2 bedrooms (one is his and the other use to be my moms and it still has a bed in the room as well as dressers full of my nan and papas stuff). There use to be a screened in room which a while back they turned it into a small denwith a half wall dividing into a kitchen...it needs some updating but what doesnt lol. there is also the full bath on this level and a living room, they still have old fashioned furniture in here...well not too old sometime in the 70s maybe or before. In this area there are stairs that lead up to the top floor. This floor consists of 2 bedrooms which are now basically walk in closets for my nans stuff (she has many clothes but in the past few yrs she has stuck with the same few outfits). After she passes my mom and I are going to go thru her stuff and as far as clothes and shoes (all 3 of us have the same size foot) figure out what we want to keep as far as clothes and shoes. Me being the animal lover that I am has no desire in her full length Mink coat and my nana had bought 1 for my mom the same day she got hers. My mom would like to give that to my aunt (my dad's sister-in-law) she has been through all of this with us being there multiple times a week hopefully it will fit her. As far as jewelry, my nan has lots she even has my old wedding rings from my 1st marriage. My mom wants to keep all the jewelry in the family which I agree, she wants to pick out something for my godfather's wife (I call him uncle and her just by her first name they are great friends of the family with no blood relation at all). My godfathers wife is an amazing woman, she is a nurse (she still keeps up her license hoping her health will get better enough again so she may return to practicing even as an in home nurse. She worked as a pediatric ICU nurse as well as a military nurse, she came to see me everyday when I was in the hospital these last few times and my godfather actually met her not too long before I was Dx and she went to all the tests with me when I was 8 and scared. I hate having to think this way about my nan but I know it is coming and no matter how you prepare for it it still hurts. My papa actually mentioned us moving in with him to my folks the other day. It was brought to my attention yesterday. My reaction was how about a cat when my dad informed me about the situation. They have been married 58 years and he has never been living alone ever (1 of 8 chldren), granted he was the chef, did the laundry and the housework. More things as she declined of course. My husband and I want kids in the next yr or 2 and if we move there things will be easier with no rent, we would split bills of course and pay 100% of cable and internet since he has no interest in it. We are debating the offer now more than ever especially since this afternoon I was layed off over the phone due to my TDI and 3 weeks of limited duty I would have. We would live in the larger of the 2 rooms upstairs, the other maybe a PC room for a while then turn it into a nursery when the time would come. Eric even said if we live there you wouldnt even need to work, which I would but when a baby arrives I could work part time. Also a few houses up the road is my nans brother and sis in law and she watches children in her house for some income (she is in her 60's and 13 yrs younger than him). Her daughter also runs a daycare out of her home (next town over) which would be helpful too. My papa would have to get use to 2 cats in the house (I take 100% care of them...they are the only good thing I got out of my last marriage). I know this type of living condition can be unhealthy but in our situation maybe it is best? What do you think (eric and my 2nd anniv is in Oct) I am afraid of our intimate times being at my papas house though. when we came back from California we lived with my parents for about 10 months and sex was rare being that there were others in the house, Eric assures me that this would not be the case here but who knows. What would you all do in this situation? If we decide to go for it we need to inform our landlord by the 1st to give him a months notice. What types of unhealthy things may occur, at this point my head is a blur with everything.",I am sure you are making some good sound decisions for Eric and yourself As well you will be able top help your grampa and out ........ I am so sorry for your loss I am truly sorry about your job.....is there nothing you can do about the way you are being treated there Huggs to you and yours Gentle loving huggs to you and your Mom and grampa as well as Eric .......

Not looking good,"Hello everyone, My nana is not doing well at all. The NH has family meetings every other Wednesday so my mom attended again today. My papa finally realized she wont be going home and that she will be gone soon. Hospice started today they are keeping her in the same room as before even though they also have a separate hospice building there. She stopped taking pills orally whether she is rejecting them or cannot really swallow well we're not sure. They are giving her Adivan and morphine IV at this point the adivan wont hurt anything. When I talked to my mom yesterday she held the phone to my nan and I told her I love her and that eric (my husband) loves her too. She was responding but so low I couldnt understand but my mom reiterated it to me. Tonight I called and some more of my family was there visiting(one of which has her Phd in nursing and teaches at a local university). She was restless even with the adivan and morphine I am unsure if they had recently given it and it was not working/taken effect yet or if she was due for another dose. Since my papa realized he will be alone in that house (he said this to my folks not to myslef and eric) about us moving in with him. That just isnt good for anyone, he needs to grieve and eric and I havent even been married 2 years yet, this last year being crap due to my crohns disease...it started flaring 1 year ago exactly after being in remission for a year. He and I want children, yes it would be nice to not have to pay rent but he is the type of man who likes to putt around the house fixing this that and the other, he would potentially be into our personal life a little more than we would like. I am sure he is welcome at my folks house anytime for a meal...granted he was the one that cooked it wasnt my nana that did the cooking. I mentioned to my folks maybe a pet would be a good idea for him, since I work for a veterinarian I can adopt a shelter pet for $0 and if I say the animal is mine all things are at cost as far as vaccines etc, surgries are free, meds are discounted...they would just have to think it was my pet so I could get the discount. Maybe not right away but he has been caring for her for many years now with her failing health. I think he is going to find lots of extra time in the end and may need to fill that void. He will be 80 in December and as far as health he is okay but many yrs ago we feared he was getting AD, he has trouble understanding things and does forget some stuff but that can be common as well, especially when in denial. Thank you all for your thoughts wel wishes and prayers Stef","The only people on the deed to the house are my papa and nan. My mom is seeing a lawyer that specializes in elderly affairs on sept 6th about placing her name on the house. Since she is an only child everything goes to her and my dad in the will she is executor. Both my mom and dad feel it is unhealthy to move in with him. I felt this way too, but eric feels it would be good for us in the fact that we want a family soon (after I get the ok from my GI). Moving in with him would help out as far as rent goes. He felt even more so to lean towards moving in after my job informed me that my limitations, (since I have been out on tdi) that are only until sept 20th make that there is no job there for me. I was told you would probably do better sitting down somewhere answering phones or at another vet office doing kennel work (that was my job there kennel work). I dont know if this is something where I could sue over discrimination or not especially after reading the section in the handbook...which I may add must also be returned upon termination as well as office keys. If keys are not returned you will be charged to place new locks and make new keys for all employees. In this situation what would you do as far as moving? What about the possible EEOE/ADA possible breech? Thanks Stef


 I decided that I am not going to turn in my employee handbook even tho it says upon termination it must be returned. I have been reading things on disability laws etc. Once things calm down aroud here I will look further into this.


 I contacted the EEOC at the end of last week and now awaiting either an email call or letter from them. If I find I may have a case then I will go about persuing it.


 Stef Mom passed away 2 yrs ago March and dad refused to leave a 5 bdrm house ......had to stay with all the memories the gardens everything.......... He ended up only using 1 room basically and that was it ........His DEN He would not even turn on the Television in the Living Room as Mom use to sleep in there on the couch I and others had suggessted that he get roomates and he definitely DID NOT want that under no circumstances ...... I could not live there at all My sister ( even though when Mom was alive ) did nothing for her nor Dad but Cait Howie and I did WE were not there one wknd Mom had been taken to hospital saw my Doctor ( our Doc ) and he said she had a "" touch"" of Pneumo and sent her home to rest with antibiotics and meds .......... MY sister then decided to rip down 80 yr old wallpaper and PAINT in the kitchen and part of LR just about near mom with no thoughts of what the fumes from paint and mold from wallpaper would do at all Mom was rushed back to hospital I was not informed til next day and I got to see her being airlifted out of that hospital to a bigger one in London...... I called that night ...no visitors ......she was resting but not in great shape they said ........I went to get the phone the next morning at 5:50 am Mom was gone I tell you this only as I know what you will face or might face and you are going to have to stand your ground ........I did ...I had to as you well know what stress and other influences have on our D Crohns I have moved Dad to Strathroy where I live put house up for sale .........he is in a self contained lil apartment AND the landlord let him keep his dog so I have to say he is very happy as am I and very close by us We both needed the move too many memories there good and bad....everyone knew your business BEFORE you did lol You and Eric have just gotten Married and I think someone else whoever the one is Executor will have to deal with this when time comes not you n Eric All I can say in closing sweetie is make some memories......... good ones ....keep telling her how much you love her and what she has done for you and your life ......... I will keep you in my heart thoughts and prayers along with your Nan and Mom .....Grampa too ....... This does not mean she will be gone right away hun she is comfy and w/o pain be happy for that for her as I know you are God BLess....... Luvs LYN


 Steph Personally there is a good point to moving in like Eric said .....BUT you's are just newly married ......I dont think thats a good part ya know You's neeed to have your own place your privacy and not worry about your grammpa 24/7 I am sure your parents think the same As for going after them for dismissing you I would not wait ONE moment longer to call a lawyer and ask your rights and what you need to do to start a lawuit That is dizcrimination I believe in all honesty They say you can get another job "" doing kennels "" well what the H*** is wrong with you staying there and doing same job they are telling you to go look for ????? I really think you can get them on this ......... Take care and please do keep posting here .......... Luvs LYN


 Please keep me in the loop I really do think there is something you can do and I wouldnt turn th book in either............. Call a free lawyer service ..........and ask all about this tital situation and I am positive they ar definitely in the wrong here Take care my friend Luvs LYN


 PLEASE keep me posted on what goes on this is not right what they are doing to you my friend LUVS LYN"
Poppop,"Hello. I dont post much, but thought that this would be a good time to start. I am a stay at home mom and have been taking care of my grandfather for the last 8 months. Up until now I just went to his house everyday but he is getting to the point where he needed more help than that. So this past weekend I asked him to come stay with us. He didnt even fight it, so that was a blessing. He never wanted to leave his house and never wanted outside help. So it all comes down to me. My parents live 3000 miles away, so they cant help. But before I ramble on in a different direction, let me get back to my poppop. He is 82, and in pretty good health. But mentally he is going downhill fast. He is confused, wont wear his hearing aids and sleeps most of the time. He wears diapers, but he doesnt even realize when they are wet and need to be changed. So here I am, a first time caregiver for an alzheimer patient. I would love any advice, tips, suggestions, etc. I did contact the alz association and they mailed me some videos for caregivers but I havent had time to watch them yet. Hopefully i can do that tonight. Thanks!","hi denise! i usually only post in the fibro forum, but i saw the title of your post. i call my grandfathers pop pop too so it caught my eye. i'm sure it's overwhelming right now for you, but you are doing a wonderful thing for your poppop. big hugs to you!


 I know they are together watching over us sis ............. Luvs ya tons God Bless Sis


 Denise YOU have your hands full and with all the DD you have as well so PLEASE please DO NOT hesitate to callon anyone of us here at anytime ' I am usually on by 5 am to answer posts and get my Crohns morning on the way SO never worry okay ......you will ahve alot of questions as I said ** IF you have time read ""Padriags long Thread he ook his wife out of a nursing home when she was almost dying and he has looked after HER every need sinc .........Never regetting and never giving up He is my Mentor and my adopted Grammpy...........

 Hi Denise . . . welcome to the forum, You have asked some great questions and I hope someone will have better answers than me. When we cared for my dad I yearned for some techniques that would make more sense than the way we were doing things . . . I always thought that if I could work a couple weeks in a nursing home, I might gain some knowledge (and I still think that might have been a good idea) . . . anyway, when things finally got so bad that we had to have help from the hospital and a hospice team . . . we found out that WE had better technique for OUR dad than they did and they were impressed with our methods. So trust your instinct. The fact that he will tolerate a diaper is HUGE. You are a huge blessing to your Grandpa . . . God bless you for your willingness to jump in and take over his care . . . the blessings will be priceless. I have many ""final gifts"" from having helped care form my dad. Lynn will be along with a big hug and some great encouragement . . . I hope you make some good friends here. Blessings!

 Thank you so much for your replies. Everyone here has been so nice and it feels like a family. I appreciate knowing that you are all here if I need help, advice or a shoulder to cry on. I will do my best to be there for you too. With 3 kids and my poppop I am not finding much ""spare"" time to do things for myself. And I also am taking online college courses. This will be my first semester trying to handle school and Poppop. I only registered for one class, and hope I can manage that. Thanks again! you are all a blessing to me."
learning to cope with my mothers AD,"My mother was diagnosed with AD when i was 16 years old and in my junior year of high school. At that time she was only 44/45 years old. It's now 4 years and i'm on the verge of my 20th birthday and still haven't come to a way of how to deal with my mothers illness. She is currently 48 and lives with me in the house we've lived in for the past 9 years. Im her only child but all of our immediate family live close by and help if and when they can. The biggest help currently is my grandmother but i'm worried that with the stress that this situation is putting on her that she land herself in either the hospital or worse. The problem that i have is that instead of facing it head on i like to turn away and i'm ashamed of that. i want to learn to (if there a way to learn) a way that helps me face the problem head on instead of running away like i have in the past. the other part thats hard for me is why now? i could understand maybe if she was older but my mother is 48 years of age and is diagnosed with a disease that is most commonly found in people way older than her and because of this i was wondering is there was anyone else on this forum that had a loved one diagnosed as young as she is or if it actually a rare occurance. thank you for your time and care, bek","Bek, although I don't have Alzheimer's Disease but like your mom I was diagnosed of Parkinson's Disease when I was only 37. Now I""m 54. Like alzheimer Parkinson is also incurable, a delibitating disease, a horrible disease. In Alzheimer the memory was the affected one, in Parkinson, it's brain cells producing dopamine that control your movements that dies. But just the same, both are neuro-degenerative disease and incurable. But what I have is courage to face the disease. Firstly you have to accept it. It's hard but this is the best way to cope with it. When you are in denial you will never learn how to live with it. But acceptance make it easier for you to make plans how to handle it. This way, there will be a slowness in the progression of the disease. You can make your plan in your life. You can make a program that will help you enjoy life and make the most of it everyday. One more thing, be positive. Don't be overwhelmed with the porblem. What your mom need now is love, compassion and understanding.


 thank you guys for you input it means alot. the biggest problem that i currently have is that is that, even though i have my family for support i feel like that, even though it does effect them, it doesn't effect them as much as it does me. My father left when i was 2 years old and i was raised solely by my mother and i didnt realize it then but i do now how much she's had to give up to give me the life she thought i deserved. The other thing is that i accept the fact that my mother has this disease. The problem is the fact that beside suporting her there is really nothing else i can do to help her and the fact is that after all she has done and given up for me that i can hardly do anything except sit and watch her fade away devastates me, yet i understand that all i can do i give her support and help her when she needs it.


 I agree hun you and your support is NEEDED and it is the best you can do along with some things as MM posted Make memories you will never reget those believe me I draw on that and mom daily just for my own piece of mind Mom did and gave alot for me like yours did All the best hun WE are here for you


 Bek welcome to HW You have made me happy knowing that you want to educate yourself about this Horrid Disease All thru the threads we have info please read the posts and information plus at the side is Resources to help you Padraigs thread is the best for doing alot of education from a Husband and caregiver's point of view most of our members are or have posted in there Please know we are here to help you anyway we can Stay with us I lost MOm a couple of yrs ago and now look after dad it is hard but rewarding too I am glad you do have family that helps out Be well and Thanks for being you LYN Also THANK you for the active INTEREST in AD.......more ppl neeed to educate selves on this DD I am sorry about your mom hun LYN


 Thanks MM great support and input


 You can do a lot of good things to your mother Bek. But like Lyn said you have to go to their world to understand her. You can slep a lot for the slowness pf the disease. You san have a memory enhacement with her. Read a story to her then after reading ask her questions about the story you read. From time to time you can ask the time, the month, the year that we have now or ask her what city and state do you live. These are simple questions to know her memory capabilities. You can sing with her, with her favorite singers and songs. You will be amazed, with their memory problems, they still know the lyrics of the songs. You can do gardening with her. JUst keep her active, mentally and physically, talk to her, so that she won't forget to speak and keep giving her small task that will keep her sense of independence. You can do arts and crafts together or play cards, bingo and a lot of activities that you can enjoy together. These will gonna help her a lot and you will develop a much closer relationship ever."
Be careful what your Alzheimer's loved one watches and/or reads,"It's me again and this time with some advice that may not be helpful, or may have been addressed so many times that it is redundant. I will offer it anyway, just in case. In helping my Mother through her Alzheimer's journey I naturally came across many things that worked and many things that didn't. I'm sure all of as current or past caregivers have that same list! Between us all, a book could be born! There were several occasions where I couldn't figure out what had triggered a specific fear or obsessive thought with my Mom. These events would linger and escalate sometimes for hours and I would have a difficult time redirecting her. I had an A-HAH moment one day when I was able to connect something I had given Mom to read with an event that occured that night. She had always been an avid reader but was having trouble keeping up with her professional and non-fiction reading, but still craved reading. As a teacher educator professor with an emphasis in teaching reading, I had a huge store of quality childrens' literature and would dole out books that almost always gave her enormous pleasure, especially picture books, books about animals, birds etc. Because she spent a lot of her ""memory time"" in the days when she was young, I pulled out my books on living in that era. She really enjoyed these young adult novels! Then one night, though, she complained of being very ill to her stomach and said she was having labor contractions. Imagine my surprise! First of all whe was 90 years old, and secondly she had never given birth, adoping all of her daughters. She was totally adamant she was having contractions, they were coming at regular intervals, and she demanded to be taken to the midwive's home. Despite all the tricks of the trade I had used to redirect her thinking, I could not budge this idea from her mind and she was becoming desperate in her demand to get help because her baby was coming. My Dad was utterly disgusted, not understanding at all, and got angry with her.I removed Dad from the equation by sending him downstairs to watch TV and then turned all my attention to Mom. I was stumped until I decided to go along with her. I loaded her in my SUV, along with blankets and a baby blanket I keep around for my granddaughter, and she and I got in the car and started a long drive through the valley for more than an hour, promising her I was looking for the midwives home. As I had hoped, within a little more than an hour of driving, she began to become tired and then asked if she could just go home to the ""homestead"" and wait for the midwives to come to her. I drove home, got her settled in bed, and sat with her until she fell asleep, peacefully. I stayed in her room all night in case she awoke terrified that she was still in the situation from earlier, listening to my Dad snore and her too! In the morning she was shocked to see I was sleeping on the chair by her bed, started doing the mother-nurturing thing of trying to get me more comfortable and then I started breakfast, with no mention of the events of the night before. I had to remind Dad not to mention a word about the past events, because she had forgotten and that was best. It was yet another example of putting myself into her reality until she could calm down and naturally fall asleep because of all the anxiety she had had. This also happened when she would watch the nightly news and was particulary afraid after watching war news, natural disaters, local and national news of child abductions etc. That would become her reality and she would worry endlessly about not only that we were in danger, but also that she needed to don her Red Cross apparrell and get out and help. When I finally figured that out, I monitored what she watched on TV, as well as pre-reading any book I gave her to read. Caring for someone with Alzheimer's is an ongoing learning curve, but at least we learn as we go along. I was surprised at myself for not picking up on this long before, but I had to remember that I was learning something new everyday and that that was the most important thing....to pick up on her signals, enter her reality, and ride the times through. Anyway, I hope this little hint can help someone. I know it is going in my book!! LE","THANK YOU This is great info and input I am really glad you shared with us and I am sure alot of ppl will take note now of what they read and watch Fantastic Thanks again' LYN


 no prob with your post Mary LYN


 It's true, it's no good for them to watch news before going to bed, or watching violent movies. Due to their confusion and sometimes hallucination this become reality to them. Instead of watching news, you can turn on your TV to music chanel especially the old ones. This will make them happy and bring back memories. Music is therapy. We have a lot of Alzheimers resident who forget even the name of their husband and children, but you will be amazed they can sing a song with lyrics. Good music always give good sleep. It's also a mood stabilizer.


 Am experiencing problems getting posts. Now let's see if I can send one. Mary


 TTT Great Info IMHO Thanks S n T Luvs LYN"
I miss my mom!,"Hey, Everyone! I am new to this message board. My mom has Alzheimers. Was diagnosed about 5 years ago. She went to the Dr and he said that she didn't need to live by herself any more. We have found a wonderful place for her. It like an apartment complex. It is such a cute little apartment. She went to have lunch there yesterday and wants nothing to do with it. She really does not have a choice. She has to move. She lives in a big house that has a big yard. She has gone off in the car to the grocery with someone that she knows, but she didn't remember. That was so scarey to us. We don't want anything to happen to her. We want her to be safe. She thinks that we are doing this so we won't have to care for her anymore. Of course that is not true. I am the 'bad' daughter. We were always the closest. I miss my mom! Any suggestions would be really helpful. Post Edited (oldestdaug) : 9/1/2007 3:14:03 PM (GMT-6)","HI and Welcome to HW I am sorry about your MOm She will not totally understand nor accept what is happening to her and will blame someone Dont take it to heart hun it is the DD and I have gone thru it with my mom bless her soul and now my dad It is very hard to deal with for them and us Please do stay and post read the other threads we have posted and get the support you need ........ I too am the eldest ........ Again Welcome Read the Padraig Posts /thread LYN


 How are you doing ......... Post when you can okay LYN


 HI there I am hoping that you will have a smooth go of it and your mom will be happy in her new surroundings I would really suggest visiting as much as possible and letting her know that no matter what you are doing and where she is SHE is loved and always will be I dont know your mom so I dont know how to approach this with my dad it would be up front and open I would have had to have really hid it from my mom if I were had to put her in a home It wont be easy on anyone I am sure but do know we are here for you to vent anytime ** could you take off the caps though please** Looks like you are yelling and I know you arent lol Thanks and hope to hear from you real soon Lyn


 Thanks Neely We have numerous threads on this and other issues dealing with AD.....BUT we certaily DO appreciate your input and your knowledge as well PlZ do keep posting and adding anything you would think pertinent to the AD forum Thanks again God BLess LYN


 hi oldest, i'm so sorry about your mom. yes she can't live by her self any more. will someone be watching over her at the apertment? i know that from my momma the diease just gets worse. she's in a really nice nursing home. when she was still at her self more, there was lots of things they could do there. bingo, exersice, games, tv, they took them shopping even. well, keep us updated. i'll say a prayer for yaw.


 Hi Oldest, Hugs for you sis . . . I'm also the oldest daughter (although I do have two older bros). You are taking good care of your mom by keep her safe. Like the others said, she will also have some structure and fun in her day. Of course you and your sibs will be visiting her often. I actually sent out a visiting schedule to my sibs for helping with my dad. I was basically the only one giving mom a break from caring for dad on a regular basis. After I sent out the schedule EVERYONE helped. It was great because we all knew that each Saturday had a visitor for dad and a day out for mom and then I took two days each week and spent half a day so Mom could get out. If they know what to do and when, they are WAY more likely to help. I hope you'll keep posting and let us know how things go. I'll be thinking about you this week!! Hugs and Blessings!


 WELL, MY MOM IS GOING TO BE MOVING ON THE 15TH, BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW YET. MY BROTHER, SISTER AND I ARE GOING TO GO OVER THERE ON THE NIGHT OF THE 14TH AND TELL HER. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO TELL HER WE WERE AFRAID THAT SHE MIGHT TRY TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME IF WE TOLD HER ANY EARLIER. THIS PLACE IS VERY NICE. CUTE AS CAN BE. I WANT TO GO WITH HER.

HELP!!!!!!!!!! THANKS I NEEDED TO VENT!


 Hi! I am a nurse in a Assisted Living facility where most of the residents have some level of dementia. I commend you for taking the steps you have to insure your Mother's safety. I know it's still a difficult decision. Everything you describe regarding your Mom sounds very typical in comparison to the residents and families I work with. I don't believe I've ever admitted a resident in 15years that wanted to move into a long term care facility. Even those residents whose dementia is end stage and can no longer verbalize any negative feelings do usually have an adjustment period. On the average it takes 2 - 4 weeks at least for a person with dementia to adapt to new surroundings. So the bad news is things could get worse before they better....not always, but usually. The good news is that they do usally get better as the person makes the adjustment. She may continue to lash out at you. Be strong and remember you are doing the right thing. You may feel like you've been raked over the coals after a visit with her, but this probably will improve over time. Each case of dementia is different, yet there are so many simularities. I don't know if there are any caregiver support groups in your area, but if there is I think it would be helpful. Educate yourself as much as you can on the disease. It will help you deal with Mom's ups and downs. It will guide you in the stages of dementia. When you see or are alert ed to a new behavior/ symptom you'll have the knowledge of where this fits within the stages. We often find it beneficial at our facility to ease residents into this transistion. I see you mentioned going to lunch at the facility with your Mom. Perhaps you may want to try that again. Take her around the facility. You might arrange to have her join in an activity at the facility as well as lunch. Of course the bottom line is although these things may help they most likely will not smooth the way entirely. You have come to that difficult time in life when you begin ""Parenting your parent"". It's not always easy, but you can do it. You'll have lots of help with the staff at the new facility. Dementia is a horrible disease. It eventually robs people of who they are. Yet, although their lives are changed they can still have a good quality of life. They can still enjoy visiting with family, even though they think you're their sister instead of their daughter. They can still enjoy a good meal, even if they don't remember and/or refuse to use utensils and just use their fingers. They can still enjoy a good laugh even if they don't remember it a few seconds later. They can still make and enjoy new friendships even if they can't remember their friends names. They can still find comfort in long cherished belongings tucked away in their own room even if they can't find that room without help. : )


 oldestdaugh Hoping you are okay and that you will post and let us know It is a family here and we do worry about one another Luvs LYN"
A Sad Story,"This happened only this morning. I went to the Geriatric appointmnet to one of our Alzheimer's resident. Her daughter was there too. to our surprized, the daughter ask the doctor, ""When will mom die? ""What do you mean?"" Dr. Mazon (not his real name) ask the daughter with eyes widely opened in surprised. The daughter answered, ""she has no quality of life, she's already out, she's suffering...look, we have our own life, we don't have time to ourselves anymore, we want to start a new life... ""I answered in a soft voice, "" We can take care of your mon and live the life you want... ""I'm paying your facility...and she's running short of money, and I don't have the money to spend for her,"" the daughter replied. ""Dr. Mazon, is there a way that she could be hospice?""Please, doctor..."" ""If only I could kill her, I'll do it. My profession is to save life not to kill people,"" answered the doctor. ""Only God knows when a person will gonna die."" "" She's doing well, she's eats well,she sleeps good, she's stable, There's no ground for her tp be hospice..."" ""You don't understand. doc...""Ohhh,crap!"" the daughter left in anger... This is sad. This is unussual behavior of a daughter to her mother. We love our mother, as much as possible we want them to stay longer with us. No matter how sick they are we want them feel that they are being loved and we tried our best to give the quality of life they need. We want them to feel that the life still worthwhile even though they are sick. And this kind of daughter is exemption to the rule. I remember one time when she visited her mom to our facility, she was so upset when she knew that we're giving her mother Ensure. Right away she discontinued the Ensure.","You are so right MM this is not only sad it is hard to think a child ( adult or not) could do this to their mother......... Snowy is right they can re order the ensure she cannot play with Doc's orders....... Take care MM Luvs LYN


 You are a very decent and loving son and I am so happy you are part of this forum You bring alot of good to it ....... Ensure or boost is a drink I have to use as well for weight gain and I hear ya and know where you are coming from Mom was 68 lbs when she passed away .......... Take care my friend Gentle huggs to you and your sweet MOm God Bless LYN


 The Dr can order esure & the daughter can't do anything about it.She can't change a Dr order.


 While I certainly do not agree with this woman's attitude toward her mother, I do understand where she might be coming from. I take care of my Mom and work full time. I love my mother dearly. She is my best friend and has always been an insiration to me and others. However, as the AD progresses, she is losing much of her quality of life, as am I. She is sad, scarred, upset, angry and confused. I am so worried about her that I am not sleeping at night, have high blood pressure and am unfocsed at work. My personal life has all but vanished. I KNOW my mom would not want to live like this and I also KNOW she would NEVER want me to be going through this every day. She is on so many medications that you begin to wonder if it's the medications that are keeping her alive. With that said, I will continue to take the absolute best care of my mom as possible. I love her and don't want to lose her. I most importantly, I don't want her to suffer."
heaven,"Hello everyone, My nan just passed this morning hospice said we should get there (this was last night) I had to leave around midnight since I had to take my meds. My mom called 10 mins ago to let me know she just passed. Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers Stef","Stef I am so sorry Know she is no longer in pain nor suffering Nan is whole again and up there watching over you and your mom and grampa .......... My heart thoughts and prayers go out to you all .......... Pick a star and it will become her to you and then talk to that star thats what I do ..........

 How you holding up sweetie ...... LYN


 my deepest symphaty and condolence, Stef. Think of using all obstacles to build the life you want. Obstacles and setbacks are often placed to your path to allow new learning ot unfold. They are there to enable you to develop new skills or fresh ways of perceiving life before you take the next step. Learn to be patient with youself


 How are you doing Steph Worried bout ya Luvs LYN


 Jeesh I wish I could be more help to you but know I am here always and I think you are right it is prolly the cumulation of stress that is causing this and not healing totally yet as well I am broke out again in Pyoderma sores but making it thru Took Cait for High school registration ...there goes my baby girl .... She is taking all Academic courses as she has definitve plans for being a Veteranian Keep me posted on you please Email is going to be the old one I cant figure out this new one yet lol so drop m a line k Luvs LYN

 Stef, Im sorry to hear about your Nan. You and your family are in my prayers. Hugs, Denise


 I am doing okay. I have times where it kinda gets lost in other stuff I have to do. My mom and I went shopping for clothes for the wake and funeral today, (I weigh less than I have in a while but due to my swelling from surgeries still my clothes dont fit). We both started crying at 1 store in the dressing room, the lady in the next dressing room must have been wondering... We picked out flowers today and put a deposit down for the restaurant. We later returned to the funeral parlor to bring her dentures, my papa also brought her life insurance info that my dad looked over with him, and the funeral director is going to help him with that. The 5 of us had some lunch at the restaurant that we will be having brunch at on Tuesday. My joints from the CD are flaring so badly I can barely walk especially having trouble with my left knee, I have lost a great deal of ROM with it in just a few days, the 1st appt my Dr could get me in with a Rheumy is Sept 18th (they called 5 and I had called a bunch too). Not to mention both ankles are swollen and my R hip near the groin, the manager at the restaurant asked if anyone needed handicapped access (since that entrance is outside of that room as opposed to within the main entrance) Eric jokingly pointed to me as I hobbled down the stairs. I am having my okay times and my crying times, then feel bad when I start thinking about it & that I had actually forgotten about it slightly.


 As my Sig says you will grow from this too I am so sorry you are going thru all this with your CD on top of everything else ....... I am hoping my email is going to be straightened out soon so we can yak back n forth........should be today .... PLease know you are always in my heart thoughts and prayers .......... God Bless LUVS LYN


 I am doing okay. The wake was monday and the funeral was yesterday. My stomach has been going nuts. My pcp called in the medrol dose pack since my joints were so bad I could barely walk. Being on that I dont think my stomach acting up is directly related to the CD, its probably a combo of stress and still healing."
"Glad ""Always Rosie Is Back ..........Sorry Due To Illness",Hey sis I am sure glad you are back but I am definitely sorry for the reasons I really hope you will get better real soon How is your Mom doing sis Luvs ya Sis,"I am doing great I was w/o sores and flares all thru packing and moving a 2 bdrm place to a 3 floor townhouse.........I decided to go to "" Superstore"" a big shopping place here and tripped UP the curb come crashing down hard jarred my body quite well...never felt it then but by that night OMG I was in tears and then a lil beggar of a sore popped up on thumb.......Trauma to body .......LOL Normalsnofun was down from Jersey that night and we had already made many plans sooooooo I bucked up and carried on we went rock climbimg ,bowling and played pool.............I felt fine and still sore was small enough not to worry about just took oral antibiotics and MTX.......

 Hey Lyn . . . so sorry about the sores . . . but glad you don't feel like *ell. I'd be happy to post the FUN topic here . . . wasn't sure if it was too silly for the forum. It has been so popular on the lupus forum that I had to start a new one just to get rid of the big long one (didn't want to bog down the speed of the forum w/a topic that doesn't need to hang around) I'm ready to split it again and delete the long one that's there. You are welcome to copy it over to here or I'd be happy to do it if you want one on the AD forum. I hope your sores heal FAST (I know that's slow going . . . *sigh*). Blessings!

ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT,"As the population of individuals 65 or older increase, so has the incidence of abuse. This is hidden in public view. It is important to become more aware of the scope and many issues surrounding this sensitive topics. TYPES OF ABUSE I.Passive and active Neglect . The caregiver fails to meet the physical, and/ or emotional needs of the individual. With active neglect, the caregiver intentionallyfails to meet his/her obligations towards the elderly. Passive neglect, the failure iss unintentional, this is due to caregiver overload or lack of information and knowledge. II. Physical Abuse : An intentional infliction of physical harm of an older person. This range from slapping to beating to excessive form of physical restraint. III. Financial Abuse :The misuse, misappropriation or exploitation of older people material or monetary assets. IV. Psychological Abuse : It's the intentional affliction of mental harm or psychological distress upon the older people. The abuse range from insults, verbal assaults or the threats of isolations. V. Sexual Abuse : It consist of any sexual activity for which the older person does not consent or incapable of giving concent. (e.g. from exhbitionism to fondling to oral, anal, or sexual intercourse. MORE DETAILS ON THE NEXT THREADS...","Thanks hun I had done a thread on this last yr and I have worked in homes that abuse was taking place I only did a couple of shifts found one lady with her colostomy bag not on properly and she had feces from one end of her to other and you could see it had been like that for quite some time I had reported both places to our Health Care for The Elderly and Elder Abuse ( akin toi Childrens services here ) and they went in and took action......... MORE and more abuse goes on daily hourly as the workers are not properly trained and or they are there for the little bit of monies they get and not for the right reasons at all Love and Empathy THanks sweetie


 California law mandates that certain individuals report known or suspected instances of elder ror dependent abuse. Failure to do so is a crime. WHO IS MANDATED REPORTER Any person who has full responsibility for care or custody of an elder or dependent adult, wether or not the person receives compensation, including administrators, supervisors, and any license staff of a public or private facility, health practitioner, sevices agency or local law enforcement agency is mandated reporter. REMEMBER : Every individual that has knowledge of an incident that appears to be abuse, must file a report. There is no penalty for filing a report; there is a significant penalty for failing to report.


 I agree that this 89 year old frail lady must not be left alone in her condo.What will happen if there will be fire, she'll be burned to death, she fell down, and her daughter did nothing, so the lady now is in agony of pain... As a mandated reporter you can report the incidents of known or suspected abuse in two ways: * By telephone immediately, or as soon as practically possible to the local ombudsman or the local law enforcement agency. AND * By written report to DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES in your area These are included in your report>>>Name, adress, telephone number of person making the report >>>Name and address of the victim >>>The date, time, and place of the incident >>>Other details, as required WHO INVESTIGATE REPORTS OF ABUSE State investigation of suspected instances oof abuse, neglect, isolation, abandonment or financial abuse are the responsibility of : >>>The LOng-Term Care Ombudsman Program >>>Local Law Enforcement >>>Department of Justice, Bureau of Medi-cal Fraud and Elder Abuse Each country has their pertaining laws and implementations regarding Elder Abuse and Neglect, and I""m sure elderly are protected in any country of this world.


 ALL great input MM and M Catherine SPOT on IMHO PLease do talk to daughter and this HAS to be reported in IMHO as well This happens all the time and ppl do die from injuries they get from falling ....... Please do let us know what is going on God Bless LYN NEEDS TO BE REPORTED.....IMHO


 I implore you althought you are working for this Lady PLEASE report what has been going on This Lady's life is at risk IMHO and has to have someone stand up for her and be the HERO if you will she cannot do it and I am saddened by all I have seen in my yrs as a nurse so PLEASE do report even though you are still working there Keep us posted LYN EMAIL me if u want .....


 Did this end up being reported or no Just worried and wondering LYN


 This is sad. I had no idea that things like this were going on. Especially the sexually one. That's a shoke that people would take advantage of older people like that. There should be laws to protect older people, especially from getting robbed and physical abuse. **HI there could you please edit the phone number for the drug company please It is against forum rules ........ THanks email me if you would like to Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 7/8/2007 9:31:12 AM (GMT-6)


 I believe this is SO IMPORTANT for people to rise up and really take notice and ACTION if they know of any abuse mentally and physically YOU have a MORAL and LEGAL obligation to do so to report it as you would Children being abused......... LYN


 Hello All, I have posted from the hep c forum months ago because my husband has Hep C and cirhosis of the liver. He is still holding his own. I have been a private duty caregiver for 25 years now. I have had alot of training in healthcare. My question is I have an 89 year old female who has had a stroke. She is very fragile. She lives by her self in her condo and does have close neighbors. She has one daughter who is an RN, a grandson who is a Dr. and son in law who is a Dentist. The problem and my concern is that they leave this lady home in her hospital bed from 6pm untill 9:30 the next morning. I don't like this!!Sometimes I have found this lady home by herself during the day. How can this lady get something to eat and all? This lady can not fend for herself! I have just started this job and I think that it is sad that this is happening. This lady fell while she was in an RN's care hurt her hand. It looks broke. They didn't take her to the Dr. nor did they x-ray it! I have been offered another position and I think I am going to take it. I don't understand the leaving this lady by herself in the night. In the am when I arrive she has feces and urine and of course I bathe her in the shower. What would you do in this situation? Thanks, donajean


 Dear Donna-Jean, Re. the woman you are caring for who is left alone at night: I thnk you should talk to her daughter the RN about how this problem and how it could be addressed. I'm sure that she would be as anxious as you are to see that her mother is well-cared for. It sounds as if the famiy could afford more help - they may not be aware of the situation as you see it. It would be a pity if you took another job when your input could mean so much to this family. Please give them the benifit of the doubt and tell them of your concerns. It would be a win-win situation for all. Mary


 Hello All, Thank You for your input. As I am still working for this lady 7 days a week for a while, I have not had a chance to talk face to face to the daughter. When I call she makes it very short! The daughter and her family are out of town and will be for the next few days. Also next week as well. I did come in one day over the weekend and found the telephone by her bed off the hook. I wonder if she would of used her lifeline button if she could of gotten help? I kinda doubt it since it works through the phone line. I also wonder if she can use her life line. Some times I find she tries to put it inside her shirt. Her mind is going down, therefore making it more known that she doesn't need to be by herself! I will get back to you folks as soon as I know something. It is hard bringing this emotional baggage with me home every day. It's bad enough to have a sick husband! Have a good day. donajean


 Has anything come out of this Any further word .....?? How is the Woman LYN"
Update.... not so good,"Hey everyone, It's been a while since I last posted and thought I would give you all an update on how life is going. My grandmother, who has lung cancer, is doing better. She's living at home now and has a nurse's ad helping her out and everything. My grandfather was officially burried back in May. He doesn't have a tombstone yet. I think we're waiting until after my grandma passes away. It's expensive! I cannot believe the price on those things. We are still paying for his funeral. But he's worth every penny. I've been thinking about a tattoo to get in honor of my grandfather. Although I am waiting until after I have kids to get it. So far there's going to be a Jack (As in the card game jack) because he was a jack of all trades. That's all I came up with so far. It's going to be a small tattoo. I have PLENTY of time to think about it. I ain't having kids for a couple more years that's for sure. As with my life, well it's been pretty busy. I got a job. I'm a cashier in a grocery store. Make good money so. I have also been going to college the last 5 weeks. It's SOOO much fun and SOOOOO much better then high school. No drama whatsoever. I love it there! Been filming a few things and writing some script s. It's amazing. I'm thinking of making a movie about my grandfather's life. How he grew up and I think it would teach a lot of people about Alzheimer's Disease and what it does to people. Not really anyone gets the feeling. It breaks family's hearts. I know it broke mine. That's why this place here helped me because you all know exactly what I was feeling and how to deal with it. And I thank you all SOOOOOO much for that. One of my good friend's grandfather passed away on tuesday. Of what, I'm not sure. It wasn't Alzheimer's but when she told me he passed away I was immediately reminded of mine. I felt soo bad for her. I wanted to go to the funeral to be with her on friday but I was at school and couldnt make it there. I did get her a card and wrote a medium sized message in it. I also found out that my cousin is now engaged. Don't know when the big day is. They haven't thought of one yet. But I can't wait for it. Well everyone that's my update. I'm sure you'll see me around again very soon. I love you all. God bless each and everyone of you!!! Nikky xoxo","Nikky I am so sorry hun so very sorry I have been away ....moving and come back to so much pain and sorrow I wish I could tell you why and have iit make sense but I cannot I am going to be quite honest as always though okay not trying to hurt you please dont take it that way Your Nana lost her love her one true love less than a yr ago and she may NOT have the will inside her to get better nor to fight this anymore she may want to go be with him ......... My dad is doing the same and I have seen so many pass from a yes being sick but truly the underlying factor is a BROKEN heart in my career and in my family life ... Now I am NOT saying this will happen honey I am just giving an example so dont take it wrong k Dont look at it from the negative way hun try to be more positive I know that is very hard BUT at least try I am keeping your nan close to my heart as are you in my heart thoughts and prayers Email me if you want to k......KEEP me posted plz LUVS LYN


 She is whole once again..............


 Sweetie it is sad but it is no doubt for the best for her and yes she is looking down on you holding your Grampa's hand...my Mom and Grammy all having a yak together ........ They are in a wonderous place that is and has no pain..... Keep posting here and know I am keeping you in my heart thoughts and prayers Love and God Bless She is now in HIS hands.......... LYN


 I have returned and let me tell you planes are not my favorite means of transportation. took FOREVER to get home. we were suppose to arrive home at 7 and got home around midnight. It was a pain in the butt let me tell ya. Other then that the trip was good. I went to visit my grandfather's grave. I miss him sooo much. My grandmother's funeral went great... well as great as funerals get. I went to the viewing on sunday and I sware this was harder then the last. I kneeled by the casket with 2 of my cousins and I just cried. I couldnt look at her while I was there. I ended using my sweater that I was holding as a tissue. it wasnt perdy. Then at the actual funeral I had to read. That didnt go so well. I tried not to cry before hand but then I got up to the podium and looked at my paper and started bawling. I couldnt do it. My mom rushed up there with me. I told her I couldnt do it and I stood there with my mom and I did read it. Not sure anyone understood me... took me forever to read but I did it. Then on my way back to my seat I almost came face to face with the ground because there was a step that came out of nowhere and I missed it. She was cremated on tuesday and burried next to my granfther on wednesday. I cannot believe she's gone. It wasn't even the cancer that took her. I actually found out that two weeks ago the doctors ran tests on her and the results were that it was pretty much gone. It no longer showed up on the xrays. But its all the chemo and radiation and lack of food that did it. Her heart gave out. Sorry it took so long to post an update but I've been soo busy this week with school and work and trying to catch up. Im all caught up in school now but work has me working 33 and a half hours withing the next 9 days and I only have 1 day off. It's crazy but at least I get paid for it. Thats the only reason why I do it.


 Thanks Lynn. I know I can come here and talk to you all more about this. I find it easier to talk online about this stuff then face to face. But it was a shocker. We all thought we had her so at least another 5 years when we found out her cancer was gone. But something funny my cousin said when she was reading the thing she wrote about her infront of church. She said ""Pappy was growing inpatient and wanted to be with you again. When you finally joined him he said ' about time you get here' "" I can picture him saying that I really can. Also while I was up there I found out a few times about my grandma that I never knew before. A different side of her I guess you can say. She kept EVERYTHING!!! my mom and aunts are still up in maine cleaning the house. They got a lot done in the past 4 days. the only thing their not touching is the atic. My dad and uncle went up there and through some stuff down for us to burn and they burned it. Like old rotting clothes and MANY empty boxes. the rest is all garbage up there. But in the mists of her keeping everything I found stuff that pretty much in a nutshell said how much she really cared about her kids and us grandkids. I didnt figure out the numbers in her screenname until Sunday. After talking to her online for YEARS. because the numbers at the end are 511. meaning 5 kids and 11 grandkids. I found a mother's day card that my mom made for her when she was little. (told ya she kept everything) and when I read it I just about cried. My mom got through half of it and cried. then finished reading it.I wonder if she is gonna keep that card. My dad read it too. It was handmade and what she wrote inside was so nice! My cousin said they found lots of geneology stuff which im interested in finding out. My grandmother helped out my cousin a lot with that. Can't believce how far back they traced. While I was up there I was given a ring and necklace (little blue heart with a cross inside) that belonged to my grandma. Then my aunt (my grandmother's sister) got a dreamsicle that she had given her sister some years ago and told me to take it. The angel is sitting down holding a BIG heart that says ""Sister I luv you"" and theres a little angel dog sitting next to the angel. I think they bought each other one like that. It's hard to think that they are gone. I came online the day after my grandma passed away and say her screenname on my buddy list telling me she was online. I IMed it and said ""Mimi?"" I was hoping she would answer back. My aunt called me and told me it was her that longed onto my grandmothers screenname. I was hoping is was some message from my grandma but it wasnt. I was also still hoping that she would answer back and her passing away was a dream.


 I had a break down last night. I might have one as I'm writing this who knows. I feel really bad right now after what I remembered last night. Earlier this summer my grandma had asked me to make her a DVD with music and pics of my grandfather. I got my camera and it came with the CD to do it. Well being the lazy person I am broke that promise. I got it in July and didnt download it until the other night where I found out I could do it. I didn't remember my promise I made her until last night. It just REALLY hurts to know that it's too late to make it for her. I was too lazy and didnt do it. I should of done it back when I got the CD in July. Then she could of seen it. I just thought I had more time with her then I did. I stayed up until around 4 this morning and started on a new project. A DVD in remembrance of the both of them. I am making it for my mom.. I'll make a copy for my aunts and uncle too but my mom gets the first one because i said so. I've already showed my dad what I have so far and he says she'll like it. Once I'm finished with it I'll put it on youtube for you all to see what my grandparents have inspired me to do. It's my way of getting through the fact that i broke my promise to my grandma and it's hopefully some way for her to forgive me. I don't know why god would do such a thing. I don't know why he would take her away shortly after my grandpa. I just can't believe it.

 Alright so my grandma was placed in the hospital yesterday for a hard time breathing and a possible heart attack. they were going to transfer her to a different hospital today but they are no longer doing so. She is taking a turn for the worse and she's not doing good at all. I don't know what I'm going to do now. I just went through all this crap back in Feb with my grandfather and Im pretty sure I'm about to be going through it again. Twice in one year. God why? I don't even know if I'm going to fly up there now or what. I just started a job. I mean I know they would let me take a few days off and whatnot but I also dont want that to come bite me in the butt when I actually do want some vacation time ya know? But I can leave school because its 4 hours long making it pretty much a weeks worth of stuff to make up and 90 percent of most of my grades are in class participation. I dont want to risk losing 16 graduation credits for this. I mean I know this is family and everything but I also want to be able to graduate with everyone else. I dunno. I guess I'll figure it out when the time comes. It might be different. although this time theres no snow so I know I wont come back sick as before. AHHH I hate this.


 She didn't survive. She passed away last night while I was at work. I told my cousin to call me or txt me to let me know if she goes and he txt me and I knew when I felt my phone vibrate as I was scanning my customer's items that she was gone. I finished my shift and as soon as I punched out I call my mom to confirm it. I went to school today and got 2 classes done. I got work for tomorrow's class but havent heard back from my friday teacher. I need to bring my camera and film my midterm and whatnot. I am not offended in anyway. I too was thinking the same thing. I know he was waiting for her with his arms outstreched. He missed her very much and now they are together again. She was a fighter till the end. I look at this trip as a positive one compare to the last time. Last time there was snow on the ground and I was soooo sick by the end of the week that I just wanted to stay in bed. This time it's summer and also I can go visit my grandfather's grave. I miss him SOOOOOOO much! I'm still a wreck from when he left and I thought I would have a break before having to go through all this again but god didn't want that. He probably saw my grandpa waiting patiently for his wife to join him and god probably felt sorry and decided to rejoin them. I know I'll see them again someday. When I'm old and wrinkly and whatnot but I cannot wait to see them again. I will make them proud. I know they are but I'm going to continue making them proud. They are watching over me from heaven with smiles on their faces. I wish I could write more but I have packing to do and everything. I will be back tuesday night. I will update you on how it all went when I get back. Thank you sooo much. Love you all!!!!! And god bless!!!


 Yup. she is.

 Here is the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyZCHAvtBYo


 Your welcome. thank you for watching it. I feel a lot better after I made the vid. Like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. That guilt is gone. Even if I wish she had seen it before she left. She proably saw me making it, smiling the whole time.


 **** on the whole popcorn and butter thing. Thank you Lynn. I dunno what I would do without you and everybody here


 I'm happy to hear that he shares those things with you. It shows just how special your bond is with him and how much you both love each other. I know you both miss your mom. You'll see her again someday. She'll greet you both with wide open arms and say ""What took you so long? I was getting tired of waiting for you guys. I missed you too much!"" lol. So last night we got a phone call at like midnight with news from my uncle in canada. His ex wife. My ex-aunt. passed away. She was still close to the family and still got along great with my uncle. My cousin is probably a mess right now. She had breast cancer and it spread to her lungs. I havent seen her in like 6 years so it hasnt really affected me. Probably because I haven't seen her is such a long time. I feel really bad for my cousin though. That was her mom and now she's gone. At least she has her dad to take care of her. Poor girl.


 the reaction of your brother sounds like my reaction when I saw my grandfather the first time I saw him in the nursing home. Broke my heart. I was in shocked and couldn't believe the changes. I'm glad to hear your brother is going to live with you and that he can help you take care of him and get to spend some time with your dad and whatnot. I hope everything goes great.


 Oh I see. It's my birthday today!!!! I wish they were here to celebrate it."
Mother has Alzheimer's and I have MS,"my mother is 89 years old and in a nursing home nearby. about 18 months, she drove from northern nj to connecticut to meet my father (long deceased) down at the nj shore. got her into nursing home near me... i'm unfortunately an only child who had much closer to father. so first dx was dimentia and medium alzheimer's. then she began shuffling, and neuro. dx parkinson's. she continued to get somewhat worse and had both symptoms. now psych. at home nursing dx. lewy bodies. hardest to deal with is her complete confusion about things she should know. she asks about her dead sister even though she went to her funeral in april. also, i have ms and she has knocked me down by opening a car door without looking. she is on various meds and i trust the home to do the best for her. feel like packing up my pets, get in my car and going anywhere! feel like i need nursing care! no real question. just had to vent! linda","Rosie has given you fantastic input I will just let you know that I have you in my thoughts ......... I have lost my Mom and my dad is going as well ...I looked after mom til she passed and will do the sme for dad.... Yes it is a hard situation and frustrating to know end at times ....... I wish you all the best'' LYN


 Hi Linda, Hugs for you. This is a really bumpy road we travel. Taking care of any ill family member is a big job . . . but when we have a chronic illness to go with it, it is a real balancing act. I normally post on the Lupus Forum, but I lost my Dad in January (Alzheimer's) and I understand your frustration . . . You need to find the right balance of caring for yourself and making sure that you honor your Mom by being there for her on those days when you can. Bless your heart, of course she is going to ask about her dead sister . . . her brain is not functioning . . . she, no doubt, is aware sometimes of how ""off"" her brain really is. Dad was often conscious of that . . . he'd cry out ""I just want to be a man again!"". Sometimes all we can do is go along with whatever world they are in. If she talks about her sister, just join in the conversation . . . it is comforting to her. I tried not to lie to Dad, but I did indulge him in the world he was living in . . . He would tell me almost every visit that his mother died and then he'd begin to cry. This drove my mom batty (and mom is a candidate for sainthood) . . . but I started telling him ""I knew your mother . . . she was a great lady . . . you took such good care of her . . . you went to visit her every chance you got"" and Dad would open his eyes really wide and say ""I did?"" and I would tell him ""Yes . . you were very good to her"". This seemed to bring him great comfort and it was actually all the truth . . . but it was a dance we did most EVERY visit for a couple of years. You just find ways to work around their repetition and their confusion. Now, I could really understand if you don't travel with her because you likely have limited stamina and ability to manage her, physically, outside of the NH . . . but I can guarantee you that you will always be happy, later, for every minute you spend with her. Once they are gone, we can't go back and change things. I'm so glad you felt safe venting here . . . you have spoken for many people in your frustration and you have the added stress of chronic illness. Its hard enough to balance a normal day without adding the stress of an ill parent. I hope you'll find a good balance of caring for yourself and giving your Mom regular part of your time as well. Some hot tea for you sis!! Blessings!"
Mom ...Part Two.......Another Mother's Day w/o you ......,This year I am finding it just as hard to not have you here....your ashes are ready to be picked up BUT is it selfish of me NOT to want them for Mother's Day??

I miss him but I know he's here,"Hi everyone. I'm new here and back in February I lost my grandfather to Alzheimers. When I was younger I spent a lot of time with him at his home up north but I lived four hours away and once I started school I didn't spend as much time up there as I would have liked. about 6 years ago he was diagnosed with the disease that we all are here to discuss and help each other through. At the time I was 13 and didn't really comprehend what the disease was and what was going to happen to my grandfather. about 3 years ago he was place in a nursing home about five minutes away from my house and twenty minutes away from my dorm. I visited him as much as I could but not as much as one would like. Near the end it became difficult to see what had become of him because he was no longer the happy, fun loving Pappy I had known for so many years, he was a thin faced sad looking man who's eyes only showed confusing and a look of being lost. I had started to finally comprehend what was going to happen the last time I saw him which was right after Chirstmas of 2006. I knew it would probly be the last Christmas that he would be with us. In February he passed away and everyone went back up north for the funeral which was a funeral held that would only be for him. There was laughing and happiness, and of course there were tears but you could tell that he was in a better place. As he lay in his casket he even had a little smirk that he was all too well known for. I will always miss him but I know in some way he will always be with me.","Again so GLAD the 2 of you can share now Mom is here with me as well I feel your pain I honestly do Be well and know YES he IS HERE watching over you's and whispering to ""keep going and live "" for him God Bless LYN


 Tara!!!! its you, yeah I know how you feel. He would of liked it very much. Remember the pictures that were showing and there was one of pappy wearing an afro? it looked good on him.


 Tara, I am glad you got on here too! The video of you guys attacking him with waterguns was the best and showed the fun times you spent with him during your early years. With every single one of us he was always a fun loving grandpa! I think along with you when he was first diagnosed we were all on a new learning expeirence with Alz. He did live closest to you during his last few years and I imagine it was hard to see him. I know just looking at photos now of him over the past two years you can see the huge decline he had each time. Probably why we were able to handle his passing as well as we have. Knowing he is back with us, knowing who we are agian, and always with each of us. I miss him too but agree with the fact that I know he is still here. Perhaps I take to much to be signs but I have had a few since we lost him. I listen to his CD pretty often and know the songs on it popular or not. Twice songs have come on during certain moments that link my connection to him. Once was in the store when I went to get a card for Meme an uncommon song came on. I sent him many cards when he was in Westgate. Another time was just a night I was thinking alot about him and it was the only song I listened to on my way home. In an email I recieved a link to a page with the same song on it. Another thing was when Jim went to Indiana on vacation his aunt had a pappillon named Pepe. I'm sure you know this but the pappillon is the same breed Dodger was. Anyhow perhaps I am a freak looking to deep but I know he's here!! Anyhow can't wait for your arrival and I'll see you next week! Love you!! Shell


 I remember you telling me those signs Michelle.


 Missing our loved ones I don't think will ever go away. But it is nice when they reassure us they are still amungst us with the signs they send to us. Lyn I'm glad your Mom sat, and spent the moment with you. Not everyone gets that connection and I feel we are blessed to know and have it. Shell :)


 Wondering how you are making out I am going with my 32 yr old son to his dad's grave for Father's day My daughter Cait lost her father to diabetes alchohol ( sp)and I am doing something with her with his ashes ( or just some of them ) for Fathers day Then having a dinner for my dad Have been thinking about you alot and worried about you Post when you can Luvs Lyn


 YOU are so right he is with you always dont ever forget that sweetie Glad you went to beach with cousin and had a great time LUVS LYN


 The way it always comes about to let you's know he is always with you Thanks for sharing hun Take care LYN


 Take care and keep us posted on how you are doing LYN


 AWW Tara... it's true. We did laugh and we're happy. We didn't cry the whole time. It was what he wanted. He wanted us to celebrate his life and not worry about him... The smirk I think was the first thing I noticed.


 :D


 lol. That afro wig was the best. We laughed sooo hard. I couldn't breath.


 So happy for the both of you's God Bless LYN


 Just shortly after Mom passed I was of course devasted....... Anyways I was in bed and I felt the bed seem to go down as if she was sitting on it beside me ....... A gentle sweet andd tender hand caressed my cheek I still can hear her saying YOU will be okay and I am all better now my sweet one"" I was NOT dreaming it did happen..........


 Yes I was and am blessed for sure I needed that time with Mom and she was there ........ You will find it may happen to you as well Little signs ....look for them ........ Be well in my heart and prayers LYN


 Hi Lyn, Sorry I haven't posted in a while. Been busy with getting ready for college and spending time with my cousin who is here visiting. We went to the beach the other day and I sware that our grandfather was with us all day. First we were sitting at the little restaurant (sp?) by the beach and we saw two parasailing parachutes go by they were giant smileys. two Pappy signs. then we were driving home and one of his songs (we made a CD to play at the funeral home for him) played on the radio right as we passed some smiley balloons. He's always around and it makes me happy to know he's there with us and watching over us.


 He was with us again last night. Our DDR mat broke so we had to drive to walmart to get a new one and I drove myself, my sis, my brother and my brother's friend to get the mat and on our way one of his songs came on the radio. We were all quiet other then me singing along with it. My brother's friend was confused and he asked why we stopped talking and we explained it to him.


 your welcome Lyn"
Sales on Alzheimer's care product,Found this website Medical Depot (URL: www.medicaldepot.com) carrying a sales on some commodes and walkers that could be useful for someone taking care of their loved ones at home. They also have other products that should be useful.,"I wish the money you spend there goes to my pocket lol! I was looking around for a walker and found them. Figure the sales they have could help those who want to save some money.


 THanks for the input and welcome If you have a vested interest in this site ( far as I can see you dont lol) please do take it out and if not I DO appreciate your post Stay with us


 Thats great Thanks so much for the link .... Hope you plan on sticking around AD......... LYN"
Try Doing Some Crafts or Involve Self in Their Hobbies,Try things just to see how they react You wont know til ya give it a shot LYN,"My nan loves going to bingo, even though she askes every 5 minutes 'what number was that??' lol. And she loves playing cards, when we was younger me and my cousins used to play with her for hours, we used to play for money lol, parents would go mad. Its a shame, all the cousins have drifted away, not much fun with just me and nan anymore, but i try. Nowadays i think shed rather sit and read a book tbh, even though shes read it 5 times already, bless.


 If doing colored eggs or easy crafts ( thread on anxiety forum) if your loved one is able get them involved as well Happy hearts are a great thing to have and to share


 My Mom is recovering from major surgery and has had the beginnings of Alzheimer's symptoms even before the surgery. Her physical health from the surgery is much better but she is quite weak and her dementia and her personality have changed drastically. She is often scared, claims she is trapped in her chair, and that she doesn't know what to do or how to do anything. Other days she is cooperative, smiles a bit, and wants to do her therapy so she can go home. Is in skilled care facility now. Can't walk on her own well -- even with walker and needs assistance with most tasks that involve movement. Our struggle is to find ways to keep her spirits up, resolve some of her control issues -- she thinks she can't do anything because she might drop things and not be able to pick them up. Mentioned wanting to do puzzles but is afraid of losing pieces, wants someone there to help her all of the time. I'm worried about Dad who comes at her every beckon and call, rubs her legs as they cramp (restless legs) and tries to help but nothing makes her happy. He is sad and I'm afraid he is going to be sick too. Are there some simple activities that we can distract her with or get her interested in? Is there some little tray with pockets that we can drape over her recliner so she doesn't lose things as easily and has a little work surface? Does it sound like we are desperate? This is all new to us. We've never seen our Mom so fearful, demanding and cranky. We want to cheer her up and help her not be so fearful. I'm sure you may have covered these ideas before in your forum-- but I'm new to this website and could use help. Thanks so much. Lynda


 Respite Care is also a great thing she can go for just the day do things with other seniors like play cards .....bingo ect.......... Just a few ideas Be well hun

 Go out into the gardens if they like that kinda stuff my dad will spend all day out in his gardens telling me and showing me how to do this and that lol I love that time out there together


 Took Dad to Wednesday market had a blast together Come home to some good but darn sad news .....in Moms thread


 LOL Lyn!! When this string has enough ideas (from everyone) you can take all the good stuff and put it in a seperate string so it is easy to refer too. I think it is a GREAT topic. Things Dad and I used to do together: Those tiny jig-saw PUZZLES (4 x 4). Dad couldn't do too much of it, but I would make clicking noises as the pieces went in and he loved it. I'd move the piece along and make a shhhhhh sound and then a click sound when it went into place. After the puzzle was complete, dad loved to ""grout"" it with glue. I spread out a big sheet of waxed paper and place the puzzle on top. Then use a nice flate cake decorating spatula and pour glue on the puzzle and he'd carefully spread the glue. It looks really foggy with the wet glue on it, but as it dries, the puzzle appears clear and shiny. Dad loved to watch it change too. Then we'd hang it proudly on the ""craft wall"". BALLOONS . . . blow up a balloon and just bounce it up in the air a few times. Eventually bounce it to your loved one and they might instinctively bounce it back. This was the only activity that dad could participate in at the end, but he really enjoyed it. DANCE . . . turn on some music and just jive around the room. Amazing how they'll follow you around. Good exercise for both the caretaker and the patient. This could pop dad out of a frustrating episode. PAINT . . . I bought small wooden objects (cars, horses, boxes) and we'd paint them with tempra paint. I used a lot of waxed paper under the work to make clean-up a breeze. If you spray them with gloss or semi-gloss clear coat . . . even the sloppy ones look good. We did some that could be used for tree ornaments at Christmas. BUBBLES . . . fun for all!!! Blessings!


 A whole pitcher of tea coming up!!! do you want iced or hot???? I'm sending both . . . lots for everyone!! Some yummy homemade cookies to go with it too! OH and have some my yummy little sandwiches!! Tea for everyone!! OH sis, I'm so sorry you are still having such a hard time medically . . . it doesn' seem fare, but there is great joy in knowing that God is always in charge even when we can't see it. I can't wait to see all He has accomplished through you sis . . . I know you are precious to Him. Good old Job!! I hated that book until I went back and read it carefully . . . such a fine ending and God even rid him of his awefull wife!! LOL Anyway, you remind me of Job sis. Hang in there!! I hope you'll give your Dad a big hug from Rosie!! He is such a character. They sure can be stuborn. Oh dear, I hope he doesn't have cancer along with all his heartache. I guess each day brings him one day closer to being with his sweetie. My forget-me-nots are blooming and I was thinking of you and another gal here named ""forget me not"". Those tiny blue flowers persisted through our dry, dry sping. . . just like you. I'll be back again soon. My son, Jason, is running the Chicago Marathon in October. He signed up with the Lupus Foundation and has a web-site where people can donate dirctly to Lupus. I was SO touched that he and his wife thought to do that . . . I'll keep you posted on that. You are a shiny star sis . . . tired and hurting, but very shiny. Thanks for all you do here. Blessings!


 Oh Lyn, how sad. It must be very difficult to see him wasting away like that. *** brrrrr**** got a shiver. If Tuesday was today . . . let me know how things went. The web site for the marathon is ""firstgiving. com/ schedler"". I put some spaces in there so it won't be clickable. Don't want to break the forum rules and I'm about to ask Peter if I can post it. Thanks for always being here sis. You are such a blessing here. I know that lots of people come here and never post, but they ARE BLESSED by your input. Hugs and blessings!


 Hey Lyn . . . Mom is doing well now. She was having some health issues for a while, but doing pretty well now. I had a scary week but am feeling more energy today. My gut was giving me lot of trouble and it scares me because that sometimes will precede a flare. *phewwww* today I am feeling more energy and less belly issues. Wooo hoooo. I hope market day is fun!! Your dad sounds like he really looks forward to it. Thanks for peeking at Jason's (son) web-spot. He is a bit discouraged trying to get it ""out there"". But I think as he gets closer to the big day, he may see more activity there. WOWWY GIRL!!! Woopie for Cait!!!! You must be SO proud of her. Oh my gosh. God finds the most perfect ways to bless!!! Tell Cait I said ""you ROCK, girl!!! Woooo Hoooo"". I have so much respect for people who accomplish goals like that. That would require a LONG TERM commitment to excellance. Enjoy the ceremonies of graduation Lyn. I hope you are well enough to enjoy it. Love you sis . . . you mean so much to me as well. I think its because we understand each other's problems AND we both have such an abiding trust in our Lord!!! Praise God! Blessings!


 So many great ideas and suggestions in this thread, thought I would share things that seemed to work with my grandfather. I think during his middle AD years just continuing to do as much as possible normal activities like gardening (even when his weeding is the flowers), and chores like dishes helped him. He enjoyed walking, and visiting. He was a handy man so PCP pipes and elbows was entertaining. Allthough at the time even in his later stages of AD he knew and he would say ""Well where's the glue?"" He was also fond of the tape measure and just randomly measuring things. He enjoyed music from his time like Folk or Fiddling and he loved watching the animated movies with his grandkids. Living so far away after my grandfather entered into the home we in Florida felt the need to be reassured it was the best solution that my Mom went up for a visit and spent some time with him. Being in a home where everyone has AD we were suprised at the number of his roomies whom were more feel type vs. the visual type. My grandfather was more a visual kind of guy. So we thought to make a fabric book. We got many fabrics and placed the vinal ones for the front and back to protect the variety of different textures inside and connected them with snaps? and a large ring held it together. I brought the books with me when I went for my visit and over the week I saw them getting used and enjoyed. Even my grandfather seemed to enjoy it and note: he did figure out how to open the ring immediatly. He was more of a medel vs fabric kind lol. We had the rings on the books saudered closed. Anyhow those are my memories, things that worked, and ideas for others. Stay Strong! Shell

Diag. with Alzhiemers,"My DH, age 69 has been diagnosed with this horrible disease about 9 months ago. I can see him changing every day.I am trying to take care of him and myself. I have Chronic Pain, Fibromyalgia, Soft Tissue Rheumatism, Chronic Fatigue , depression , among other things. He has been so defensive lately. I can't seem to do anything to please him. I am 59 but physically I am in a lot worse shape then he is. I had to get my Doctor to give me nerve pills to help me to deal with the same questions over and over and the paranoia . He just sits and watches tv all day long and drinks coffee. He doesn't want to do anything or go anywhere. I take him to his Doctor and Dentist appointments because he was getting lost and having a hard time ever finding his way home. Between his appointments and mine we are pretty busy. Today has been a bad day. I took him to the Doctor and he asked my DH how his memory was and DH said oh it is getting a lot better I'm doing good. Which of course is not accurate so I had to tell the doctor that he is getting worse. They increased his Namenda.He tells me he is so scared and I try to comfort him but I am scared to death. When his mind is made up to do something there is no changing it. I want to take care of him, because his Mother is in the nursing home with alzheimers. She is 88. But I don't know what is in store for us. We are Christians and so far, he has continued to go to services with me. I pray to God to help him. His Mother is so pitiful. I try to visit her once a week. She doesn't know who I am and it is so sad. I am probably not making sense so I will close. Carolyn","Do you have Power of attourney? you will need it.............


 Snowy is right though YOU will need POA and the sooner the better ....... Perhaps talking toi him and just telling him you are trying to get "" all "" in order in CASE something were to happen may help I will bump up the thread ( bring it back up ) about POA and how to go about it ........ YOu are goiong to need your son and g son to help you out there We are here for you for support and you can come here to cry ,vent whatever we will never judge you WE have walked in your shoes sweetie Please dont forget you have us as well God Bless LYN


 Carolyn Welcome hun Yes you are making plenty of sense You are scared for one seeing the man u love change daily Knowing what this DD can do I am sure you have done plenty of reading I look after my dad lost mom in March 06 to this darn disease and I too am struggling with many health issues BUT I keep going what else can we do I have crohns PG a/p and a couple other things going on I will not put dad into a home and I finally had tpo stop being so stubborn and get Homecare to come in and help me out a bit I was getting to run down and ill myself Is there any kind of care services there where you are reputable services that can help you out right now Your doctor can sign some forms stating this is needed for your health as well PLEASE do stay with us hun we can BE that soft pillow to land on right now and the support you need right now You very well cannot continue to do this on your own and your options are limited so I would think that having someone come in may help you out or even family do you have family that will help out at all hun?? Please stay with us God Bess Email me if you would like to talk more info is at the side LYN STAY WITH US PLZ


 I haven't even thought of power of attorney. Yes I have 2 stepsons and a stepdaughter plus my son. I think my Son and one of his Sons will help some, but that is all. I don't think DH would be happy if i brought up the power of attorney thing. He still thinks he is ok."

Do you educate yourself on your own?Have you talked with other cargivers who live with AD 24/7? I have 30+years under my belt,& do know a few things contrary to what you think. Me? Bitter? Mo way Jose'.


 DONE!


 if you click on the thumbs down you put that person on ignore


 Thought I would bump this one back up for us to share ideas and such as Snowy suggessted It helps to exchange info and caregiving ideas IMO


 SHARE please There is so much we can do to help one another and thats what this forum is all about right


 HI there YES Please do share and I am sure you will be an asset to this forum Glad you are here and share away Take care LYN


 HI again I too am going thru alot will my illnesses and DD at this time and I too BELIEVE you have to have a positive outlook onlife and a good attitude abitu everything Some days are rougher than others BUT I seem to always get thru them with my attitude and so many wonderful friends I ahve met thru HW I owned a Retirement home for many yrs til sicknesses tok their toll on me I now look after my dad with AD I do miss nursing and thee personal touch.....the love you develop for your patients Take care and thanks again LYN


 I did that once, too! I don't know if there is any connection, but I found that I hadn't logged myself out, either. Once I'd gone back into the system and done that, the first problem seems to have corrected itself. Now that I've written that, it doesn't make sense. Hope someone else can come up with the answer. Mary


 You can go back to the ignore and re undo it lol.......I am sure of that Snowy would understand hun believe me she is a doll LYN


 hmm,CMAC strikes again,lol..........


 I don't see cmac, and you won't either, Lynne, if you click on the ""thumbs down"" button at the right side of their post box. I'd also like to echo your comments about updating the group on things which were found or treatments which were tried. Giving us feedback encourages us to help more in the future. We don't bite Pat


 Sorry to highjack this thread,but can you please explain to me what you mean by cmac? And what will happen when you click on the thumbs down sighn? I was too scared to try it incase I did somthing I shouldn't lol. It's probably realy simple but I am afraid I don't have a clue. Thanks. Sue


 Hi Snowylynne. I understand now,what you said makes sense. Sue


 I believe that there are plenty of us with combined knowledge we should be sharing and helping one another LUVS God BLess LYN


 Can I join and share. I'm sick of Parkinsons Disease but I'm working as an administrator in the residential care facility for the elderly and we have Alzheimers residents from the first stage to the end stage. My experience might help... minmark


 Thanks, as a caregiver and administrator at the same as a patient too I hope I could help. I had Parkinson's Disease when I was 37, now I'm 54 but still working full time. The key, I remain active physically and mentally and what is important is the right attitude. I'm always positive in life.


 Help...I goofed! I was reading in one of the posts that when clicking on the thumbs down icon, that message would disappear. I was curious....another downfall, so I clicked on ""snowylyne"" (now I can't remember the spelling) and she disappeared completely!!! I didn't want that!! How do I get her back?? Anyone know how to undo a dumb dumb mistake like that?? LE


 your advice, unfortunately, did not allow me to get ""snowylyne"" back onto the threads. I made her disappear!! I am so sad. That should teach me to act on my technological curiosities! Anyone else know what I can do to bring her back??? LE (Linda)"
Binswanger Disease,"Does anyone on this site have a rare disorder called Binswanger Disease? There is dimentia, except not exactly like Alzheimer's. A lot of other symptoms occur w/Binswanger including problems w/cognitive thinking, unsteady gait, TIAs, heart problems, etc. Thanks for any info. I've researched the disease, but looking for someone else who has it.","I have Binswanger Disease. Since it's rare, I've been through a battery of tests. There is no cure and no tx except treating the symptoms. The prognosis is not good. I could not bring myself to tell my husband until this past Saturday. He knew I had a neuro problem, that there is not cure and only tx symptoms, but he did not know that it will shorten my lifespan. We've been through our house being severely damaged by Katrina, our only g'daughter diagnosed w/leukemia, me being out of work for almost a year due to this and our son is going off to college this summer. I do not want my son to know at this point. I've had a stent placed in the right coronary artery which has tremendously helped w/heart arrythmias (not nearly as many). I'm on 3 BP meds, but still BP goes up & down for no reason. I experience TIAs on a weekly basis (used to be daily). I eat nutrious meals, weigh what I'm suppose to weigh, etc ... looking at me I look in perfect health. I never know what each day holds ... some days are as ""normal"" for me as normal can get. My left side is weak (left arm seems to be getting stronger ... I use a 6 lb weight), but left side is constantly numb and doesn't work like the right leg. I've practiced for months, gave away all shoes w/heels, and have developed a walk that unless you stare at my feet, you'll never know. It's affected my cognitive thinking, gait, balance, etc... in other words, it stinks! Just hoping to find someone out there who knows what I go through & wants to talk. Thanks for listening!


 Pegleg Would like to learn more from you about this Disease


 Hi Pegleg No I have not come across anyone with this and even in all my yrs of Nursing I will do some research and call a few places it might be called something else as well?? or no I am glad you posted and I hope you will continue to post here as this does seem like it fits in with AD,Dementia and all the others under the umbrella Take care Do you have this or someone in famil?? Be well


 My heart goes out to you hun You have been thru Hades and still going thru it I dont know much about this other than your input but I do know I WILL be here for you to talk to about this and a soft pillow to land on I also have a rare skin eating disease that is horrid and very painful but like I said very rare it too shall cut my lifespan and I have a teen daughter Cait whom I adore I cannot bring self to tell her this part of DD ....she has been thru enough with my crohns and another illness( severe) I have not brought to the boards ......it is scary when you have no one to talk to isnt it Maybe just maybe fate has brought us here together to be one anothers shoulder.......... I am here for you you need to talk privately let me know k email me its under my name My name is .LYN......... Post again please God Bless and Hold you thru all this I am so sorry (((((((lots of Gentle ones)))))))

dad diagnosed with cancer,"Hello, I not been here in a while. Dealing with some heath issues of my ownL (Chrons disease, but thats a whole other story) My dad was diagnosed with alzherimers a guess a couple of years ago. Was having trouble with brothers, Took a great family vacation and made some great new memories with my dad. Thanks to Lyn who told me to make sure that I enjoy the time that I have left with him. Thank you lyn!!!!!!! Any way dad is not doing so great His dr took him of his alzheimers medicatation *only works for 2 years?) Cant be left alone at all any more, I think he is decling very rapidly. He went for a check up to reg doctore, and cna you believe they found cancer. It is in his bladder, stage 2. He will be starting Chemo in a couple of weeks. Of course he walks around saying the he is going to die. My poor mother. She his really going to have her hand full. I just went bacl tp work full time so I will not be around like I used to be. One brother is out west. (he comes in every month) My other brother help out when they can, but she really leans on me. I am gone at work all day, and really feel like I am letting her down. She need some help what should I do. I really do need to work, Kids going of to college. She will not have a stranger in her house to help her. She wont take dad anywere with out her. He won't let her leave. My sisterin law went over the other day so she could go to a wake (great outing) and he would not let her leave with out him, so she did not go. Any way, I am rambling. Thank you for letting me vent. Hope everyone is doing ok. My thoughts are with any one effected from this terrable disease.

 We talked a little the other dayI am glad you are doing a bit better I think im hitting the down slope...I dont think I have fully come to terms with the fact my grandpa isnt really with us anymore...I think itll really hit when I go april 5th to the cemetary. I havent been since the funeral. I plan to take off work that day and go down and ""be with him"" I have to cut this short as the tears are welling and I cant break down at work. Will post more later maybe.


 yeah its still out I gotta call today for now you can find me on my cell...I want to find the poem I wrote a yr ago but I cant find it :( will have to search harder.


 Phones still out will br til atleat wed...hopefully they will fix it... As you can tell by the time of my post I didnt sleep to solidly or I probably would have still been snoozing the alarm. Warm milk zonked me out but didnt exactly keep me that way...I guess with the anniversary a lil over a week off Im kinda off my game if you will the depression and anxiety have been rough... I think I am starting to dream again too but I havent remembered them yet...But I been waking up in panic mode. Then again I been doing alot of thinking as to what I will be doing on the 5th when I go visit him. I thought I was ok with it by now but I guess I am not.


 Lil One ........You know what this is about ..... Miss Me ........But Let Me Go When I have come to the end of the road, and the sun has set for me I want no sadness nor any gloom..Why cry for a soul set free Miss me a little - but not for too long and not with your head bowed low Remember the love that we once shared.....miss me ....but let me go For this is a journey that we all must take ..and each must go alone It is part of the Master's plan...a step on the road to home When you are lonely and sick at heart,go to the friends you/we know And bury your sorrows in doing good deeds Miss Me But Let Me Go......... ..


 No problem my Lil One I hope it will help you out I am here okay Love ya Mom out


 So true she will be with yous both always..."
Still Loves To Do The Things She Always Enjoyed,"My mother has always loved to garden and have her gardens look like something out of a GOOD HOUSKEEPING magazine.............Other things she is involved with is the Church Clothing Share that we started a few years back,she goes for the friendship and conversation.We are always going thru old photos and making collages of them and she proudly displays her handiwork.My only concern really is that she loves to cook and with a gas stove that can be dangerous so I make sure that myself hubby daughter or DAD are their to watch over this.She has never taken to being treated like a child and I would never ever do that to her ........I want her to always have her dignity and self worth..................................Anyone out there that has a simuliar story to share ?Be gald to hear it ............Take Care And God Bless ......LYN","Hey Lyn, I think I'll take Dad tomorrow to shoot a bucket of golf balls!! He still loves golf and I don't know how . . but I'm sure he would enjoy a bucket of balls!! Thanks . . . this was a great topic!


 Thanks Lyn . . my mom loves gardening too. AND . . . she can work circles around me!!! LOL I bet you ARE sore!! Take care now!


 I am so glad you had a beautiful day together and I have tears thinking bout your Dad seeing his old buddy what a great surprise for your Mom too ................makes me feel all warm inside ......please keep me posted on how you are all doing I know you are bust but if ya get the chance I love to hear about him and you together GOD BLESS YOU


 bump


 No problem there are quite a few more that I will get to as well ......My Dad use to be a drummer in a Jazz band ........still does his Jazz thing .......God Bless ........Lyn


 You are so right. Dad used to fly and he loves to go the local (small) airport and look at the planes in the hanger. I am surprised they just let you walk in there. He still loves to go golfing so one of my brothers takes him. He is looking forward to the end of winter so he can golf again. Dad used to do some oil painting . . . so I might try some painting with him too. Thought we'd start with some Tempra paints and see how that goes. Dad used to have a race car too. He had a stock care and raced for many years. . . he enjoys talking about that and another brother made a collage of pictures that he enjoys showing visitors. We are currenlty into small jigsaw puzzles and he has a hard time with it but he is patient and enjoys it so it gives us about 1 1/2 hours of time spent together where he is calm and enjoying himself. Great thread. I hope to see others add to it. Blessings!


 AR.............Hope you have alot of fun, Mom and I were out in the gardens today .I am so sore........ lol..........but its worth every stiff aching muscle and joint just to see the smile in her eyes ............you will see that with your Dad tomorrow he will love it...Take Care and God BLess


 OK . . . today was fun . . . we went and golfed a bucket of balls at the driving range. Dad really enjoyed that. Then I drove him to visit a man who he used to work with (dad always like this fellow and the fellow thought of my dad as a father figure). Well . . . when they were visiting dad just broke out in tears because he was soooo happy to see this guy. It just warms my heart to find something dad enjoys doing!!!!! Then we went and bought some pansies for mom. It was a good day!!! Mom was happy (and got a nice long break), Dad was happy . . . and I was REALLY happy!! Blessings!


 Thanks Lyn . . . you are so sweet. I can't believe that you are fussing with this when you need some rest yourself!! I hope you are feeling better. BTW: I think I enjoy my visits w/dad more than he does. Blessings!


 Thanks for bumping this Lyn, my Dad loves jazz music so I think I'll get him a big picture book (he can read but doesn't retain - but he likes pictures!) on all of the old jazz musicians and ask him to tell me who is who, etc. He actually used to know a lot of these men, he is originally from Chicago and was a young man there when the big jazz era started.

Mom hurt her back- painkillers worse!,"Mom fell and has a compression fracture in her lower back. She has had alzheimers for a while now but has been doing well so far. Short term and long term memory not so good but still functioning, walking, talking, interacting, eating well etc The pain is throwing her off a bit but i suspect the meds are throwing her off even more. She's also had a UTI (they gave her the wrong antibiotics twice now cause they didn't do a sensitivity test to see what drugs the bug is resistant to) and she's been constipated mainly cause of the first pain med they gave her (Darvocet) which was horrible. She just finished taking Percocet but i think this is having its own side effects. She walks ok some of the time but gets really shaky (specially when first getting up)- almost like a Parkinson's tremor which then goes away when she starts walking. She's done this before when she had pheumonia and was weak- it was almost like she was afraid to walk and got really shaky (she had also done it after she had fallen a previous time but it only lasted a couple days) I have spent the last three weeks mainly at home during the day (my work lets me work nights and thank god is very flexible) but i'm getting seriously burned out. Its more frustration than anything else. After the Darvocet we had to rush her to the ER cause she was out of breath, clammy, sweating, and zoned out- we thought she either had had a stroke or a heart issue. It was the meds. She still gets out of breath however and her pulse goes to 110-113 when she goes on a short walk and no one has told me why? They checked her head for bleeding and her lungs and heart and everything was ok. I'm not sure if its the meds that are making her shaky and out of breath (and behaving kinda weird), the UTI, or if something else is going on- very frustrating cause she won't tell you exactly how she's feeling. There are times she will sit on the recliner (when i put her back her back doesn't hurt as much) and just moan :( Does anyone have any advice about this? What i could check? i'm getting her an appt with a neurologist and her vascular doc (even tho they did tests in the ER for heart etc) but other than that i'm at a dead end right now. I just want her to get back to her baseline :( Thanks for any help.","I toally agree with mm here please have the proper test done for UTI's and it will help with pain Percoet is DEFINATELY not a good drug for AD ppl and there is milder ones such as tylenol # 2 or even extra strenghth Tylenol as when she has proper antibiotics as mm posted her back pain will subside Please do keep us posted hun My heart thoughts and prayers are with you ........ Luvs LYn Thanks mm for your input


 I am glad she is doing much Most doctors DO NOT listen to us or the person that is sick It is great to have a doc .........like I do that will listen ...... When taking Mom to docs I made him listen and HEAR what was being said Plan of TX was for us to devise together and I WOULD have it NO OTHER WAY ....... This is the same now with dad as he goes thru all of what Mom did ....... Allot of times ER docs are visiting docs or really busy dont know the patients and dont go thru the total and proper Treament and cause plan of action I am glad however that she will become much better now that she is being treated appropriately.....and the dehydration is being taken care of THAT is not your fault you tried to get her to drink but once she reached a certain level of the Dehydration Nothing would have helped except the hospital hun so no blaming yourself YOU are doing a great job Heart thoughts and Prayers are with you and your Mom God Bless LYN


 I would suggest that your mom must have a urinalysis to know if she has UTI and to know the appropriate antibiotics for her. UTI cause confusion, agitation, tremors like what you mentioned and back pain too. Hope your mom will feel better... minmark


 Thank you for all your suggestions. She did have a UTI like they had told me originally but they treated it twice with the wrong antibiotic. They kept her in the hospital and are treating it more aggressively. She was dehydrated even tho i was chasing her around with water etc. The painkillers caused most of that. She seemed better when i went in to see her yesterday. NO more gaping mouth open or garbled speech. She's still tired though. I was originally upset at the doc in the ER (before she got admitted) who wanted to blame ALL her symptoms on the alzheimers. When i asked about her shaky walking he said: ""well that happens and she won't be able to do what she did before"". I was like......... this JUST started and something is causing it- its not her baseline at all. I also tried to explain she doesn't normally look catatonic but until the tests came back (that showed her electrolytes were all out of whack cause of the dehydration and that the UTI was still there etc) i don't think he really was listening to me. HOpefully she keeps improving and gets back to her baseline. She might have to go to rehab for her walking- usuallly that takes a little bit to come back after soomething like this. Again thanks you guys"
Alzheimer's Drug Fact Sheets,Hello everyone. I found a good source for Alzheimer meds fact sheets: http://www.alzinfo.org/treatment/drugtreatment/cognitive/default.aspx#1 I thought somem might be interested (I have had a hard time finding good info all together). Blessings!,">AR checked out the site and there is really good info on meds there ,signed up for the newsletter as well..Did you notice nowhere in there was ativan/lorazepam mentioned for use .it makes the ad patient more aggitated in my opinion and i know that docs should know this if they hace any clue about AD ......hoping to get chats started soon got in and out ok lol..Take Care and God Bless


 Oh . . . good Lyn . . . maybe we'll keep this one bumped up or have Peter include it with the Alzheimer's resources. Thanks for the heads up on Ativan/lorazepam! Blessings!


 Hi Lyn, My son's wedding was on Saturday and I spent the day with Dad today, so things have been pretty busy here. I hope to join you in chat Wednesday, but it will depend on how hectic things are that evening. Will be there if I can. Blessings!


 Hi Bag Lady there are alot of interesting thing in that and other older threads I will continue to bump them up ok ........I too have it in my Fav's lol......How are you doing anyways .........God Bless ....Lyn


 Medication can cause ( wrong Meds) the person to show worse signs and become easily aggitated and more confused IMHO LYN


 Please ppl feel free to add any info you might have so that we can all benefit from it Much appreciated LYN


 Aricept for memory retention is the most common medicine for Alzheimer's. But as the disease progresses, there is a behavioral changes with Alzheimers. They become restless and agitated. This is the time that Ativan or Lorazepam is given. but it must be as needed. Some doctors prescribed Seroquel or Zyprexa to control their behavior, to calm them down especially if they have sundown syndrome and these will keep them quiet.


 What I mean to keep quiet is exactly what you're thinking. They become totally out of reality. They stop talking, walking, and just looking on a blank wall. They a re quiet the whole day. They say it's part of t he disease. but this happen after taking those powerful medications. I know they should not be given this medications. They become worst and vegetable. What they need is love and compassion. Patience and understanding.


 TTT


 AR will check out this site thanks ............will be on later gotta go to do errands k ....new thread for caregivers and other peeps...................am gonna get BUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY when i get back ....hope all is well Take Care and God Bless


 ............Finally am checking in daily as for the meds as I am always worried about Mom and what her doc will give her IF I am not at appointment:although am there 99% of them and he had given her ativan/lorazepam at the last one I didnt go to (coulnt figure out why she was acting paranoid and was very disoriented,dizzy..........well come to find out he gave her those pills...........took them and explained to her and then took them to docs office and gave strict instructions as to what meds she cannot have :he was ok but I think his nose was a bit out of joint lol.better than Mom having a broken hip or something right .....gotta do what I have to for her sake ...............Take care AR and SL and you give that Dad of yours a big hugg ............God Bless


 Hey Ar and SL how the heck are ya hope to see you in chat Wed night ...............have a Church council meeting so I will be there for a bit and then to chat ........take care and God Bless


 Thanks for bumping this to the top. I have put the link onto my faves list.


 Make sure you are dealing with a great Geriontologist that knows what meds NOT to give to AD ppl


 There are a couple of meds talked about in thread ""aricept""


 TTT for new members


 Any of the Benzo meds are NOT meant for anyone with dementia..................


 I agree with Snowy here hun I saw too many times ativan and or diazapam making AD ppl worse and more aggitated"
I need advice please,"Hello. I usually post under fibro and lupus but I came here to ask for advice. My grandfather lives alone, and has alzheimers/dementia. He takes a medication, but I cant think of the name right now. He manages to get through his day. His neighbor brings him breakfast, he gets Meals on wheels at lunchtime. He hardly eats any of that food. I also stock his fridge and cupboards and that too rarely gets eaten. He Never bathes. He is starting to wet his pants on a regular basis. He quit shaving. He is confused about everything. Basically, he has been ""on the fence"", not quite bad enough to go into a nursing home but not quite good enough to live alone. I am trying to do as much as I can for him (I am the only relative he has in this area, so I have no help with this). I shop for him, take him to appointments, do his laundry, pay his bills(I am his POA), etc. But I cannot be there everyday bec ause I am a stay at home mom with small children. I cannot take them to his house because it is in such bad shape. So I raised the question to my husband about whether he would be willing to have him live with us so I can do more for him. I could make sure he is eating better, bathing, etc. And I would be able to handle his laundry, medications, etc much easier if it was here at my home. My husband loves him and wants the best for him, but he is also concerned with bringing him into our home because of our small children. He is afraid that my grandfather may do things, say things, etc that would be bad for our kids to be around. I will be honest, I have no idea how things go with Alzheimers. I dont know what to expect and I guess I need to find some information. But my big question is...... is it a good idea to move him into my home and family. or would he be better off (or would my family be better off) if he was forced to move into a nursing home or assisted living. BTW, he refuses to go to assisted living, etc so I would have to ""force"" him, which I dont want to do. Thanks for any help and opinions!! Denise","As Snowy said it has to be your home or a nursing home he can no longer stay alone. But , be fore you make a decision you need to educate yourself, get ahold of you local Alzheimer's foundation. NOT just a support group but the foundation so you can get some material as well as classes they offer. You will need to have hubby involved as well he will need to be at these classes as he will have to know how to respond. Yes some where down the road grandpa my say some thing he shouldn't maybe accuse the kids of taking his change because he has lost it... But You cant make a life commitment either way without knowldge. Call your 24 hours hot-line for Alzheimer's. Hope I have helped Nae


 Thanks so much for the advice and for the thread bumps. I did check into assisted living and NH in our area, but he is very much against leaving his home. I cant bring myself to force him into a home, so I am really trying to convince my hubby to accept the idea of him living with us. I keep joking and telling everyone that he is my 4th child, but to be honest he kind of feels like that. I really think that it would be easier on me if he lived here. I just hope my family will agree and can adjust to him being with us. Thanks again!! Denise


 I'm from Parkinson""s forum but I want to share my idea too regarding your problem. There's no place like home. The comfort and peace of mind is hard to find in nursing home. Take a care giver who can stay 24 hours with him. In his status he can not live by himself anymore. He might be lost, or he might have an accident that will endanger his life. They easily forget and sometimes confuse. There are home care agencies that provide caregivers with reasonable rate. You can always ask for their fingerprint for background check. You can interview them before hiring. God Bless


 Sweety, I know he's not wanting to leave his home. My grandfather didn't want to do that either. We had to force him there because his place was no longer safe for him. He would get up in the middle of the night and leave his house and get lost. My grandma had to call the cops and friends to help find him. Even if he still somewhat knew where he was from time to time it was time to place him. It was getting harder and harder for my grandmother to take care of him. Have him live with you, get some knowledge on it first so you know what to expect. Also as for him saying things and doing things with the kids around. It all depeneds on what kind of man he is. My grandfather LOVED kids so he liked having them around but when we went up there one summer (the summer before he was placed), he wasn't really enjoying having teenagers around. And pretty much we all are teenagers except for 2 cousins at the time. My cousin went to hug his mom one time and my grandpa was like ""Get your hands off her."" And he almost hit him... his arm wasnt long enough. But he would NEVER hurt a fly. So sometimes the disease will change his personality. While he is living with you thought look into some places. Mine was placed in Bangor, Maine and they took such great care with him it was unbelivable. The staff was magnificent!!! If you have any questions feel free to ask. How old are the kids if you don't mind me asking.


 I just cant bring myself to put him in a NH. I know he doesnt want to go and I dont want him to go in one. I truely want to take care of him, even though I realize it is a long hard road. My kids are 15, 3 and almost 2. And they love Poppop and he ADORES them. I swear he lives for the kids. So I am not so worried about that, but my hubby is. My hubby and I have been having some very serious converstations about it and I think he is coming around to the idea. I really am hoping he decides soon. I think every day that Poppop spends alone now is too long. But for now I will keep doing the best that I can, and I contacted the ALZ association. They are wonderful!! So helpful and full of great tips and suggestions. They are mailing me a movie about being a caregiver. Ok, one more quick question.... if and when he starts living with us, I need to know if is ok to leave him alone for short amounts of time? Things like grocery shopping, doctors appointments, etc and also my family goes to my mother in laws every Sunday and we spend most of the day there... can he be home alone that long? He is a homebody and never wants to go anywhere or I would take him. Thanks again!!


 HI there I would try it for maybe an hour and be close by to see if he does try to go out of house or not Another thing to do is invite a friend over to sit with him while you are away if that is possible I am sure there is also homecare that will come in during those times you are out and afraid he will either wander or get into any type of trouble Just some thoughts Take care LYN


 It's either your home or a NH.He cannot stay alone any more.He might go out get lost or worse get hurt. You may not want to force the issue but it's coming to that already.............


 PLEASE check out Nursing Home Thread snowy did for us I dont think he would be a problem in your hom and would be looked after as he should be but then I am a firm believer in having them live with you instead of NH Thats my opinion ONLY ' Alot of ppl cannot do this so NH are the only option unless you can get a caretaker thru an agensy and have them checked out thoughly prior to coming in to lok after him 'A male would prolly be the best but again just my opinion am bringing up some old threads for you hun God Bless Keep us posted plz LYN


 In a way he will be you other child. As he has become in need as a child. He will do things that maybe come cute, or maybe upsetting or possibly so very sad ,but he will be needing you in what ever capacitiy you can get him. Please again I ask you to get all the information you can to educate you and the family. When my gramps had it he would continue at one point to call my daughter by my nick name and at the time was 7 . She kept saying mommy he keeps saying I am you. I said sweety in his mind now you are honey. Just let him call you this nick name. She looked the spitting image of me. He would also acuse the kids of taking his money which really hurt them the first time. Until I explained grandpa wasnt grandpa anymore . It was tough and he did not even live with us only spent days with us. My aunt had him placed in an Alz facility. Anyhow God bless Renee


 If you/ve never done it,caring for a person with Dementia 24/7 it's not a walk in the park by any means. You give up everything for that person,unless you have the money to hire someone to come in so you can get away as the stress is unbelievable.


 My mom made me PROMISE her that I would NOT put her or Dad into home and I di not she passed away last March ( 2006)..BUT was in her house til having to go to hospital My dad I am tring to get him to move with me as well anmd yes he will be like my child How could I not??????? He never abandoned me once thru my childhood and all my adult life ya know I wish you all the best Yes it is not easy but IT CAN be done..... need to talk email me ...under name at side ......... God Bless and gentle huggs for your dad LYN


 I wouldnt risk it because like you said he likes his house and if he's left home alone on sundays theres always a chance that he tries to go back to his place but i really wouldnt know. Sorry. 15 year old huh? I'm pretty sure he or she would be able to help you out when your dad goes to live with you. He/she can watch the younger ones sometimes and whatnot."
My Dad ...........,Days are shorter he wanders more ........I feel I am going to lose him too I dont think he knows or sees a reason for being here any longer I despise what this DD does to our Loved ones,"Thank you so much you have no idea what your words mean to me I know they are not just words but true feelings of a very gentle loving man God Bless........ Lyn


 Thanks so much I also am in tears I really do despise this DD what right what does it have to do to them and us before we want to break in little pieces Thanks so much for being here Luvs ya


 dad came here the other day saw the pics of Mom and swore it was me I was so broken hearted and then he said he had to go home and make ""Judy's "" supper I rellay wish he could grasp that she is gone but then I know in my heart once that is done he will give up n just go with a very broken heart believe me ppl can die from a broken heart ...... I want to thank all of you for you love and support it means the world to me ...... Take care all and God Bless Lyn


 Had a great day but very long got some good deals and spent fun time with dad Just the medicine doc ordered Lyn


 Dad seems to be less moody now that those meds are out of house they are definitely meds not for dementia /alzheimers at all He is still going down hill but I am getting more memories with him as is caitlyn He seems so afraid and so dang alone i try to be there but I canot always do it all myself I have told siblings to step up as I am quite ill myself and could use the help Just playing the ""waiting game "" with them all I am hoping it wont be long for them to help out God Bless


 lyn, my heart goes out to you!!! i know how you feel honey, i too had to watch my dad go down hill fast, though with him it wasnt AD or Dementia, Dad had heart problems and was diabetic, and went through 9 months of watching his health deteriorate. there is nothing harder than losing a parent, my dad was 58 when he died!!! i hope that things settle with him soon and you can find a way to make him happy if even for a short while!!! what lyn says is so true, you should treasure the time you have with your parents cause they won't be around forever!!! take care Sandra xxxxxxx


 ok, so now you have brought tears to my eyes lyn!!! lol seriously i know i am so many hundreds of miles away from you, you know you will always have my support, and i will always try and help to comfort you in any way that i can you vent away any time you want, i will always listen take care of you and your family too, as well as your dad, you need to make sure you are ok !! as for what your family have done, unfortunately there is nothing you can do to change that, but at the end of the day, you will always be the one whose concience is clear, and that will be rewarded in the end sandra xxxx forgot to add, am doing ok, have had a bit of a cold, wrist improving but still not 100%, but will get there, just getting organised for Christmas just now, but all family are well just now xxxxxxxxx


 Dad and I went to market yesterday a very long day he is getting worse it seems I cant keep him in reality to long before he he is slipping again.......... I am now moving him in with me I fear for his safety the tables have turned and now I need to look after him God Bless Lyn


 That and yard saling is about the only thing I can do that he likes and will pay attention to Yes you are right my health is very fragile BUT I have no others to help out I will get some help with respite care and home care I know my way around those places lol been in the business to long or was Thanks sis for your support and concern it means the worls to me How are you doing Take care ' Luvs ya Lyn


 So good to hear from you sis HOW are you doing things are not great for you either I bet How is your Dad doing and Mom holding up ?? Hope to hear more from you miss you lots Be well and all the best


 Lynn, I have been feeling WAY better in general. My feet feel almost normal if I keep my cushy shoes on. I still have to pace myself, but am doing way more. Mom actually seems to be dealing better recently. Dad is now in the throws of incontinance (both ways). We can't get him into depends, but I brought mom some inserts for his underpants and she can get away with that sometimes. You and you dad are in my prayers. Blessings!


 ...........My dad is drifting away he will not leave the house him and Mom shared ,he is really heartbroken and in a slump last few weeks .He spends his time in one room his den and has a five bdrm home which is going to cost plenty to repair and fix up before it is ever sold .I dont care about that at all I will finance that without question what I do care about though is I CANNOT FIX DAD It has been almost 8 mths and I know I still find it severly difficult so I know he has got to be in so much pain and so dang lonely for her You are with someone 40 + yrs and then they are gone My younger sister treats him like a baby and this he despises but he wont say anything to her This warm and giving loving man took in 3 kids that were not his and treated us no different then his bio daughter as a matter of fact him and I are the closest still always have been Peeps up town are ""talking"" about how sick he looks and we ( cait Howie and I ) as well as some close friends hear al this and that ""he wont be alive in another month "" crap Do they not know the pain that sets up in all of us especially Cait or moreso perhaps they do and dont care.................................................. I make sure he eats but he is dropping weight so fast ...........he is a broken man He is not Dad yet he is................. does that make sense to anyone .......... Cherish your parents if you have the chance please............... God Bless...... Lyn


 Oh Lyn, words can't express how sad I feel for you and family. Our greatest gifts are only on loan, hold them close while you can, be gentle and thankful. I'm sure your Dad is all what I always dreamed a Dad might be. I have lost count of the times I thought I was losing Jean. Please God give you a strong back to carry this cross. You and your family are in my thoughts and prayers. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Lyn, your letter brought tears to my eyes. You help so many people on this forum with your words of encouragement. I wish I could begin to do as much for you. Life is so painful sometimes and this stupid disease is definely not fair. My heart and prayers go out to you. All you can do for your Dad is give him your love, Try not to listen to what people in town say, they don't know your life and they should mind their own business..........Inert


 Thanks all for helping me thru a very tiring emotional day yesterday God Bless Lyn


 Am taking dad to Market today it is one of his favorite things to do so we do this each Wednesday he talks away to all the vendors and they are so ggod and polite with him That makes me kno there are ppl out there that still do care God Bless Lyn


 Dad got himself all upset seeing the IV in me again .......he has seen them for yrs , But forgets I just told him the truth it was antibiotics and not worry himself over something so silly lol Other than that he is not doing to bad but surely not himself I found blister packs with Restoril in them about 39 of them (pgks) I asked him if he been taking them to sleep and was told yes sometimes........ I now have them here at home with me and will ask the doc as I don't think he should take these They were Moms from yrs ago that would make him moody confused and miserable at times IMO


 Dad I miss the you and I love you so much Your lil girl Luv ta ya your daughter


 Hey Sis So good to hear from you How have you been have not heard from you for so long seems forever ............ Dad really never had it hit home with him about Mom and still calls me by her name at times or will make her a cup of coffee as was his routine .....Mom would cough and dad would have her cup there second cough meant next cup lol They had given all of us kids so much and it angers me so much that none of the others will do anythig for Dad now that Mom i gone along with the money ya know Mom was the ""accountant"" well she thougt she was I had to do all banking and everything but they would go behind my back and get her to give them her Credit cards and she also had an open line of credit at Sctia bank here in Canada (which cheque is basically cash ) and they did a number on that I am still sorting thru so much of it all and finding things about all of them that angers me to no END....... I found that younger sister got Mom to buy her a car for 5000.00......with arrangements to pay $200 per month ..2 payments made Her daughter and B/F got Mom supposedly to be a co signer for a big screen TV and stereo .well turns out Mom was the actual signer and now because she died they owe nothing:IMO they should be paying Dad this monies owed monthly so in all the things they got from her for nothing is sickening and THEY feel no guilt no remorse How can they live with selves They never cleaned her up took her to appointments NOTHING except take advantage of her BUT nor do they have the memories I have of her and the time I spent with her and the gift she was to me and my daughter....... We got to share so much with her not monetarily but emotionally and lovingly and to me thats what they missed out on and thats why I can hold my head HIGH knowing I gave and did all I coulf for Mom Same as with Dad I too am the only one (howie and cait) that do anything for himUNLESS they get something out of it ya know ........... I will find it hard to lose Dad as I have always been closer although he is not biological father he is mine in all senses of the word and has always been there for me .........Never once did he give up on me and I was a realy bad teen lol got into everything ( grew up in 50's ) lol so...........I treasure each and every moment with him then and now and I know I will be glad for it Sandra thanks so much as you can see I needed to get that off my chest and I want you to know I appreciate your love and friendship in so many ways you are my special Angel God Bless Love ya sis Lyn


 Thanks sis for your care and support it means more than words can EVER express Glad you are doing better and family too I also am trying too get going inot the Christmas Spirit Will be first one w/o mom and I know that will be hard but I am determined to make her part of it all anyway Please keep me posted on how you are doing I have missed you immensely and think of you always And YES at the end of each day my concious is clear and I do hold head up for I know I have made dad have another good day God Bless We go to market today so that is something we both enjoy always have done together Take care hun and keep in touch love ya lyn


 Lyn did any of your family help out in the end? I am concerned for you because from what I have read of your posts it seems that your health is not too good either. I know moving your dad in with you seems the right thing to do,but will you cope ok? Can you get any outside help at all? Like you with your dad,I sometimes take my Sister to the market. She always used to love Wednesdays because it was Antique market. But now if I stop and point somthing out to her that I think she would like to see she just seems to be anxious as if she cant wait to get out of there. its so sad.


 Hey Lynn, I'm sorry I've dissapeared sooooo long. Sending you a great big gentle hug and really feeling your pain. Sounds like your dad is working his way toward your mom. *sigh* Its certainly been a l-o-n-g, tough year for you sis. Glad you are able to express yourself here. I hope you are taking care of yourself. Love and blessings!!


 hey lynn am so sorry to hear that it has reached the stage where you need to move your dad in with you!! it is good that you know your way round the system, cause you will need help with your Dad, you cannot do it all on your own!!!! it is just such a shame that it has all been left to you to organise, families eh!!! please remember to take care of you too, or you will be of no use to your poor old dad thinking of you always sandra xxxxxx


 Sandra hun thanks Yes thankfully ( or ?) I do know way around the system and still have contacts in the Adult Protection Services and Community Access Care Association THis will sure be handy for me I know it is hard to do but I am the only one stepping up to the plate Hmmmm they seem to have forgot all he did for them I know I can hold head high at end of day and to me thats what counts Can They? I seriously doubt it Thanks for your post and please keep in touch Loves ya"
Question about books on alzheimer,"I normally post on the UC part of this site because I have UC but my father-in-law has Alzheimer, My mother-in-law has been wanting to get some books on the disease so I was looking on the bookstore here and there is so many different books on it. I was wondering if anyone here could make a sugestion on which may be the best to start with. He is in about the second stage of the disease now. Any help would be appreciated. thank you all","I totally agree 'That is the best one I have come across Welcome to this forum and please do come back Support is always here for you and help for your Mom in law as well....coping with all this ...... It is a horrid disease and robs us of them and them of us ..... Be well and hope to see you again

 LOL I always need to talk and I am sure with all you are going thru so do you Keep in touch k Sweetie and hey Thanks for your kind words I only give back all or try to what has been given to me thru ppl like you and HW ppl


 Dear Rona, My husband who is 87 years old with early Alzheimer's takes the antidepressant Trazodone for insomnia. He takes only 25 mgs, that is, half of a 50 mg. tablet, at bedtime. I've noticed that he's much better on it, whether that's from having had a good sleep or because of its antidepressant quality, even at that low dose. It's a fairly new drug, I think, and needs a doctor's prescript ion.


 thank you all very much, its not my hubby, its my father-in-law, my mother-in-law takes care of him pretty much by her self my husband keeps him for a few hours when he can and I go out and set with him when she needs me to. the antidepressent is for mother-in-law, she needs something that wont knock her out to where she cant function. oh on the books I found the 36 hour a day books but there is like 4 or 5 aditions which one would be best? you guys are great thanks.


 Have her look for ""The 36 Hour Day"" book.


 Thank you snowylynne and Lyn I think I saw that book on the bookstore at the top of this page I will try and get it for mom, And Lynn you are so right about this being a horrid disease my father-in-law is healthy as a horse phisically. He has always been really active and worked all his life even after he retired he still put in 10 hour days. Its so sad because now all he does is sit in a chair pretty much and watch t.v. and you can tell he isnt happy. and when you talk to him he will try to answerand when he gets confused he will say this darn disease I just cant remember and it just breakes my heart because he knows what it is doing to him and we are helpless to do anything about it. He remembers us sometimes and others he doesnt but he tries to let people think he remembers them, He goes along till they leave then he will ask mom who they was because he doesnt want them to feel bad about him not remembering at that moment. Its really sad and really hard on everyone and I am affraid of what is to come but we will do what we have to do to help.Im sorry I am rambling thank you both.


 Thank you I will look for them.


 Im sorry for you lose. My mom will be 75 this october and is starting to have some medical problems and I just hate to even think about that time coming.When you are young you just dont think about what life will be at 50 or 60 and how all your loved ones will be because they always look strong and healthy then wham it all just comes crashing down at once. But with Alzheimers it just is so hard when they dont remember who you are and when they forget the little things like how to tie there shoes. Its not that you have to do it for them that isnt the problem its just watching them struggle to try to do it and cant. someone that is your hero, your idle, your protector and then it is like it is gone almost overnight. My mother-in-law is having alot of trouble with depression but the meds the doctor gave her makes her to non functioning any suggestions on a anti depressant that isnt to strong but yet will help. sorry I am rambling agian.


 she is 73 I thinkwill be 74 this year, think you for lisrening it seems to help just by talking to someone who understands what going on. My mom-in-law dont have a computer and doesnt want one but I think it would help her so much if there was people she could talk to about it. She talks to me but I dont know alot more then she does.


 you are a very sweet,careing person and if you ever need to talk just let me know.


 How are you making out Rona

 Hi Lyn, So sorry I missed this post. I have been in and out of ER and doctor appointments, and I guess I just missed this one. So sorry! I hope your dad is doing OK. I know it is nice to just be able to sit with him. Your memories coming back to him might help! We, too have had a truly cold front. It is a little warmer today. Yesterday I dressed my front lawn with my lighted and animated deer, lighted trees, lighted snowman, and lighted nativity. It looks glorious...but I can't get my hubby to move his ""horse"" (LOL) and put the lights on the house. That always makes me so mad! You do deserve some lazy time! Take it! YIPPIE! I am sure it will be nice to get back to church! I love going to church! God bless and stay well, Maddi

 Research team identifies human ‘memory gene' Read all about it at: http:// www.bannerhealth.com/about +Us/News+Center/Press+Releases/Researchers+identify+memory+gene.htm ""The impact of the study is that it gives the research community a new and important handhold into truly understanding the process of memory. The ramifications of this report are ultimately developing new and effective medicines that can combat memory loss, and that might also help improve memory in people with memory disorders like Alzheimer's disease.""

 Hi Lynn, I don't know why the link doesn't work as it is. I fiddled with it, dong all I know to do to get it to work. I can get it to work if I copy the link and paste it into a new browser. I hope you get to read it. Otherwise let me know, I will copy it and send it to your email address rather than through the forum. God bless and stay well, Maddi


 Hi Lynn, I hope this discovery brings help to those in dispair. My husbands father has recently been diagnosed with Altzheimer's Disease. It seems he sleeps 18 and even more hours a day! He doesn't remember even simple things...i.e...on their anniversary a few weeks ago, Jim's parents went out with friens they had know for years for an anniversay celebration. At the end of the ""date"", the other couple wished Jim's parents a happy anniversary. ""Oh!"" said Charles (Jim's dad), ""Are we having an anniversary? When is it?"" It was sad.. God bless and stay well, Maddi


 Hi Lyn, Thanks for your kind words. Yes, it is devastating to watch your loved one slip away, further and further out of your grasp. You want to hold on, but eventually, they let go of your grasp. We do have our sweet memories, which I hope helps sustain us. God bless and stay well, Maddi


 Hi Lynn, I lost my dad when I was 11, and my mother when I was 16. Of course, at first it was devastating and so very sad. Now, I do have such sweet memories of them, and those memories make me so warm and happy! It is a good place to retreat...into my reverie. It is lovely there! I do have a lovely life now, too, with my husband and daughter, our friends, and all of my furry critter kids! God giveth and He taketh. I bless the time I had with those that are gone, but He gives me the joy of knowing that one day I will have an eternity with my loved ones! What a happy thought! And those times will be joy filled, no pain, no sickness...just happiness! God bless and stay well, Maddi


 Hi Lyn, You are my angel. Big luvs, Maddi


 How sweet is this! We are here for eachother! That's what friends are for! God bless and stay well, Maddi


 Hi Lyn! I am sorry you are sick! No, no! That will never do! You get well quick! I have been down and out with pneumonia, and pancreatitis, and I think a minor flare of Crohn's. My RA kicked in pretty bad, and I had sores in my mouth and some on my face...so I think I was having a flare...but the pain from pancreatitis is so severe, I don't think any other tummy pain registers at that point. I did revert to the stinky ! God bless and stay well, Maddi


 You are so sweet. Yes, the pancreatitis pain is worse than any others I have experienced, bar the raw Crohn's Disease on my sit-upon. It was just as painful. It brought tears with every BM, I couldn't sit as it burned so much, and walking made me cringe! But I am OK. I am so used to it now. I have been doing this for nearly 40 years! YUCK! God bless and stay well. Lots of love and prayers to you, Maddi


 Hi Lyn! It is a very cold. but none the less glorious day! The Lord has blessed me with another beautiful Sunday! While at church, I will be praying for you (I pray any and everywhere, but church is special.) So I hope this stinky flare is over for you soon. As far as gifts from this DD, tell 'em ""NO!"" Don't accept any more gifts from 'em.! That particular gift giver is a devil ! Lotsa luvs and prayers for you! God bless and stay well , Maddi


 how are you doing hun hoping all is well in your part of the world major storms and wind chill here Ahhhh Canada EH ......lol


 I finally got all my decorations and nativity scene up as well Yes I cannot wait .........I am feeling much better ,sorry you have been ill ....... I love being in Church as well Calm serene and so beautiful especailly when sun shines so on the Cross...... Take care God Bless Lyn.


 Oh, my lands! Lyn! I have heard (read) you speak of your mom so much (maybe it was in the past?) I did not know she passed. I know it's hard. And all of these sad, sad times popping up, anniversaries, passing of one so young (oh, my...I am so sorry for the young mom left with two small children. I know it must be sad remembering all of these things all at once. I always try to forego the sadness by remembering fun things that I did and had with that particular person. I am so grateful to have my memories when so many others don't. I will read your memorial to your mother. I know you loved her and worked so hard for her. She is at peace now and truely enjoying her rebirth! I had been so very sick. I just couldn't sit at the computer. In and out of the hospital with my stinkin' pancreas! Then we had big winds that blew down our fence, rennovations began...new fence, new floors through out the house excet for the bedrooms and now it is painting fest! All of our furniture..including my computer, was stored in the garage. So I have either been sick, or tired or sick and tired LOL! And just recently, my beloved Chihuahua dog, Peanut, died. She died in trying to deliver pups. She was at the Veterinary hospital, but they could not revive her stopped little heart. All three of her puppies were still born.

meds they started my grandmother on,"Hello everyone, While my grandmother was in the hospital over the last weekand a half they did start her on 2 different meds for Alzheimer's. The meds they started are Aricept and Namenda. I was wondering why this combination since I read that Aricept is for mild cognitive impairment and the Namenda is for moderate to severe Alheimer's. Has anyone here been on or knows someone on both of these meds? How do they help with Alzheimer's? Also how long does one have to take the medication to gain benefits from it? Sorry about all of the questions she has had memory issues for the past couple of years then went downhill at the begining of last month refusing to eat sometimes which turned into all the time. My family was finally able to get her to the hospital due to her not eating (they called the rescue). Since she had a diagnosis of breast cancer back in 98 (she has been cancer free since) she has refused to go to any doctor exept her GP (who himself is 73). She gets extremely scared when it comes to medical tests. Her biggest fear in life was that she would get cancer and after she did she never was the same. I just cannot believe how fast this progressed. Stef","I believe it is a good combo I do hope it works for your Grandma MM is right keep your Grama busy I wish you all the best Please keep posting your input and letting us know about your Grama LYN


 HI there D I believe ( crossing all fingers n toes) that by then after she is more adjusted as you say she will join in along and do some activities I AM glad to hear they actually have an activity calander where she is ........thats ONE great thing Yes please do keep us posted ....I am following your story and I am hoping it all goes well ...... I am in the midst of moving BUT will be on at least once a day or every other day to check in k Email me anytime God Bless you and your Mom for all you are doing for that sweet woman you call Nan Luvs Lyn


 Usually that's the combination they are giving, for memory retention and to stabilize or if possible to slow down the progression of the disease. You must wait for three days to one week before the medication work and see the development if it helps or not. The progression varies to every person. It depends to their lifestyle, the medication they are taking and to the support they get from the family and friends and to the medical team that handle her case. Keep your grandma busy, physically ang mentally and this will be a plus factor to delay the progression of the Alzheimers.


 I hope when she gets more adjusted to the home that she will join some of the activities. The august activities calendar was there while my family was there Saturday and my mom went through checking off things she may be interested I just hope when the activities come she wont say no anymore"
NEEDING ADVICE,"It sounds like he may be able to be on his own for periods of time why not just get someone to come for the driving .If he does not need someone there 27 7 then dont make him have anyone there ......the time will no doubt come for that .

I would give him back as much freedom for now as you possibly can and go from there just have someone come in and be his driver ......If you need to tak my email is there under my name also there are resources on Alzheimers in the yellow box at side ..I hope to see you more and you will be supported here........God Bless.......Lyn","Thanks Snowy .........Totally agree thats why I said for her to have someone drive him BUT you are right get the keys from him and thats it ......there will be an argument I am sure but better he not be driving right as for the ""Relatives helping out "" hm I really honestly would just find so meone to come in daily and check on him get rid of them if they are not doing as they are supposed to be doing and getting paid for it .....Not right IMO.......Hope to see you more and you will find this a fantastic place for support.........God Bless,,,,,


 Find a home health care service in the paper... or look in the phone book for a decent company. These caregivers sound lazy!! They should be watching him! !! :( or even put an ad in the paper for ""In Home Health Care Aid""... to find the right help, and then you can scrutinize applicants and their experience? You need to explain when you get the new caregivers that he is NOT allowed to drive alone, or maybe even drive at all? I hope this helps. *HUGS* Twiggygal~


 Wondering if you have read the input Lyn


 I am glad you have posted again Happy to hear that your dad is doing better as wellThe sundowning I have seen in different stages and the wandering from stage 2 ......but I believe all are different On the side is resourrces which will give you a great amount of info as well Please post and let us know how you are doing and how your dad is ...... TAKE care of self too it is easy for the caretaker to be run down fairly quickly Lyn


 Hi Lyn, Things are not going great. The caregiver we hired was smoking pot and drinking in the house. We fired him and are now looking for someone to replace him. Needless to say we are having a hard time finding anyone. I have a question about how much to pay a caregiver. If the person is not skilled in cargiving (my dad just needs to be driven around and can do everything else for himself) is $1500 a month and room and board (a private room and bath), cable, phone, etc enough for Monday through Friday (24 hours a day) and weekends off? We have a maid to clean once a week and a gardener, so basically the person just keeps and eye on dad and dirves him around. What do you think? Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks. Michelle


 Hi Snowylynne, Thank you for the input on the pay issue. It has been a horrible week. I am having a huge fight with my sister over all of this. She told me a month ago we were paying too much and should not pay more than $1,000 a month and now told me tonight she thinks I need to pay about $3,500 a month for someone to watch over dad!!! Then I find out she wants her unemployed deadbeat son to get the job! No wonder she wants me to pay so much. He cannot be trusted and I do not want him taking care of my dad as he has done drugs and alcohol just like the last caregiver. (She says he has quit.) I don't beleive it for a second and I am not going to subject my dad to another druggie. You can imagine this has caused a huge rift in our relationship. I am so tired. I don't know what I am going to do. I need to find an honest cargiver for my dad and I have been looking and can't find anyone. I have called agencies but they want almost $200 a day! Any advice or ideas would be welcome. Thanks, Michele


 HI LYN, THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT. I MIGHT HAVE A LEAD ON A COUPLE WHO DOES THIS KIND OF WORK AND MAY BE AVAILABLE. KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED THAT ALL THIS WILL WORK OUT. MICHELE


 THANKS, LYN FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT. I JUST READ ON ANOTHER BOARD about YOUR SON'S AUTO ACCIDENT. I THINK IT IS AMAZING HOW WITH ALL THAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE, YOU TAKE THE TIME TO GIVE ADVICE AND COMFORT TO COMPLETE STRANGERS. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT A RELIEF IT IS TO BE ABLE TO TALK WITH SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS. MY FRIENDS ARE GREAT, BUT UNLESS YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE WITH AD, YOU CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SADDNESS AND FRUSTRATION WE ENCOUNTER EVERY DAY. A MILLION THANK YOUS. YOU AND YOUR SON ARE IN MY PRAYERS AND I HOPE HE HAS A COMPLETE RECOVERY. MICHELE


 Hun I know sometimes we think we have way too much on our plates and I feel it at times BUT if I did not have HW and the ppl here I would be a lost soul........ I have gone thru so much in the yrs I have belonged here and I have been cared and supported thru it all by ppl that didnt know me right from my first post I was welcomed with opened arms as I had been dx with Crohns and had not a clue what I was doing what was happening I just knew I needed to find support As far as the AD goes it is a thing that is so close to my heart I cannot begin to explain in full just know I am here for anyone I can help if only a bit and to support you or them in ways they need Padraig has his own thread there he is a man who took wife out of NH to look after himself she was nearly passing away but for the Grace of God and his love n caring for her she has lived a good life and continues to do so at home with him He wrote a book I have read it and it would tear your heart out yet at the same time fill it with hope and love for one another ......... Yes my son was hurt had many stitches and I needed to look after him too but the more I do the less I worry about my diseases and what goes on I feel at peace thinking I may have helped someone today just by listening it is hard to imagine not having HW honestly and I am so pleased you have become an active member there is no need for thanks hun I might need to lean on you in the next bit as the anniversary of Moms death draws near so this is what we do we support and care for each other as an extended family Thanks for your kind words they mean alot Please do keep in touch on this thread okay Let me know how thigs are going ** Could you take off the caps hun * thanks Luvs ' Lyn


 Hello all, Great news! I found someone to stay with my dad. The man is a widower who is 72 years old. He is in good health and would make an excellent companion for my dad. They are close enough in age to really bond and have a friendship. He is a friend's father-in-law and I know this family well. He will move in within a few days. I think this is a great solution at this stage in dad's AD. Dad can still do everything except drive so this man will be more like a campanion than a caregiver. Wish us all luck. Thanks for all the information and support. I will keep in touch. Michele


 Hello All, Sorry I haven't posted in a while but things have gone from bad to worse. The older gentleman who I hired as a caregiver, was leaving my dad alone all day and only coming home at night to sleep. I fired him and now I am back to square one. My father refuses to have anyone else stay with him saying he wants to live alone and is sick of people living with him, he doesn't need anyone there, etc. The doctor told us he doesn't have a problem with dad staying there by himself during the day but would feel more comfortable if someone stayed with him during the night as he could start to wander. (He hasn't so far.) My brother (who lives 2000 miles away) and I are in agreement that I will go over at 7 am, noon, 4 pm and 8 pm to check up on him. I stay anywhere form 30 min. to an hour each time I go. My sister who lives 50 min. away and rarely even visits dad and gives me no help whatsoever, DEMANDS that I immediately hire someone to be there full time, even though dad has refused to allow anyone in the house. She said he doesn't have a choice in the matter and is threatening to make trouble. Her real agenda is that she wants her jobless son to be the caregiver. (He used to be the caregiver and he did a terrible job...letting him drive alone, missing dr. appointments, etc. so I got rid of him.) Now she is telling me to hire him back and I refuse. My sister is a selfish, coniving manipulator who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. I have two questions. 1. Dad gave me power of attorney to handle his affairs and make decisions for him when he can no longer do so. So far, he still runs his own life even though I handle mostly everything regading money, etc. Can she take me to court and force me to make him have a live in caregiver (against his wishes) or have him committed to a nursing home? Has anyone run into something similar to this and if so, how did you handle it? 2. My dad no longer drives so he cannot harm anyone. If he is alone for part of the day, it is possible he could hurt himself (fall, etc.) but that can happen whether he has AD or not. I feel at this point he still should have a say in his daily life and living arrangements. My dad has threatened to sell his house to get away from all of us when we have insisted someone should live with him. The arguments are horrible and they are killing our relationship. I say let him live alone for a while until we can find the perfect person instead of hiring some service to come in that will just send over a bunch of strangers and I guarantee he will not let them into the house. Any advice????? Thanks a million. Michele


 Hello, I am new to this board. My 84 year old Dad has AD. He was diagnosed 2 years ago and can still do everything for himself even though he has almost no short term memory. I hired two caregivers just to drive him around and keep an eye on him. The caregivers are relatives and he is not aware they are his caregivers. We had to make up a cover story for them living with him as he insists ""there is nothing wrong with him."" He has been told he has AD but refuses to realize his severe memory loss is a problem. These caregivers are not working out and I am on the verge of firing both of them. (They are lazy, they let him drive alone, etc.) I have not been able to find another live in caregiver. I have three questions: 1. Any suggestions on how to find a caregiver (I have asked everyone I know) 2. At this stage in his AD, would it be safe for me to not have anyone live with him 24/7 and instead just hire someone to dirve him around? He does not need any help for things other than driving. (I did hire a maid to come in to clean.) Ihe doctor said he prefers he doesn't drive anymore but said if he insisits, he can drive to the store and back. 3. Also does anyone have any advice as to how to make my dad understand he needs someone to drive him and/or live with him? He is retired military and independent to say the least. He is very agrumentative when I have tried to talk to him about this and has refused any help. Any advice would be appreciated as I am at my wits end.


 He should not drive,period.The Dr.told him no.Take the keys & refuse to give them to him.Disable the car if you have tio to keep him from driving when no one is there.He won't like it,but he'll be alive.


 Just wondering how you are doign and how your Dad is .......Post when you can to let us know please ' God Bless Lyn


 Thanks Twiggy for your input Lyn


 Hello everyone and thanks for all your input. I really appreciate it. I am sorry it took me so long to post again on this board. A lot has happened and I have been trying to deal with it all. I did fire one of the caregivers and the other has shaped up and is doing a good job. I hired a caretaker for the weekends and he was very good but just gave his notice. So I am going to try to take care of dad on the weekends myself. I am a teacher and I put in long hours during the week so I hope I have the stamina to work the weekends too. The good news is my dad's car died and it was going to cost too much to repair so he junked it and then decided he wasn't going to buy another one. He is happy with me driving him around. Praise God. That has been a tremendous blessing not to have to argue and worry about his driving. Dad is doing well. He has gained a lot of weight now that he is not active so I am tryng to get him to do some exercise. He continues to be independent and do almost everything for himself but is becoming very stubborn and argumentative. But I try to take it all in stride and take it one day at a time. I have one question, at what stage does the wandering or ""sundowning"" usually start. I want to be prepared for what is coming. Thanks again to all. Michele


 How are things going Lyn


 Wow,that's alot of money for no more than the person does.plus all the other goodies they have,lol,& weekends off too?That's a cushy job.


 That is alot of money as Snowy has said I would put an advert in the paper and get a few responses then ask THEM what they think there time is worth with the duties if there not doing too much living there and not having to pay rent they need not get too much renumeration Please dont let your nephew look after him this is just so sad I am sorry for all you are going thru ......

 HI hun I think you have answered you own question myself He is okay during the day inquire with a reputable Nursing care agency about having someone in just from like 11 to 7 am .... Introduce him / her to your dad and let it try to go from there.... I last check on dad about 8 myself and he is fine till I go over in the am ............ I ma not s worried now as he no longer smokes and I have him listed with AD society in case HE wanders but usually he will come here I can see his house from here ..... Please keep posting and let us know how you and dad are doing YOU ARE AN ANGEL........."
Black Americans and Hispanics Need /Want to Be Educated about Alzheimers,"Thru my reading I have come across the facts that more American Blacks and Hispanics are not being educated in the proper ways about Azheimers at all ...this makes it a stigma to some and then they feel they are "" stigmatised"" to the point that they feel they are not dealing with Azheimers but "" natural aging"". 67% of African Americans........ 63%of Hispanics......... Agree they do not know too much about this DD and they thought or think of it as natural aging. They would appreciate being educated about Alzheimers:: the early signs, the medications the way to have loved ones DX all of it ...... I believe that we all as a group could help them out in their quest for knowledge and understanding .......also these 2 groups of ppl thought they were at HIGHER risk for Alzheimers. The stigma around AD and the 2 minority groups promotes more miscommunication and misunderstanding about the Alzheimers as well as promoting more denial of the disease and delay in the DX of it. Most of the African Americans and Hispanics do not put their loved ones in Nursing homes nor Assissted Living but DO use support groups and such to help them out I truly believe that we should ALL be free in helping one another in this battle of this Disease that robs us of so much in our loved ones. If you have any input it would be appreciated. Take care all and remember.............. NEVER TO LATE TO LEARN NOR TO HELP YOUR FELLOW MAN/WOMAN","Hi 9ball Glad you popped in I would love to see more of you here and perhaps we can all work together at learning ya know....... Did you take your Dad to a Neurolgist ,Gerientologist or family doc ?? Just wondering I find it sad that some of our fellow Canadians of different race and also Americans of different races must learn this all on their own ..We need to change that for sure That had to have been very difficult IMO Please do continue to post here I am usually on during the ams Anytime you want to talk you can email me at my email addy at the side under name Glad to have you aboard and please Stay with us


 As 9 ball said they HAD to learn all on their own about this DD EDUCATION is really important imho


 I had to educate myself once my father was dianosed with the disease. I knew nothing before then, but I did know something was wrong with him so I took him to the doctor. 9ball


 Just a little tidbit of info The Chinese also hold there Loved ones and Elderly high in their culture I believe in all my yrs of Nursing I saw and looked after one Chinese man and only because all his family was gone ...."
The  Stages  of Alzheimer's Disease,"The early stage, the person seems to be confused and forgetful. She may lose some important items, forget recent conversation. Usually the person may not even notice that there is a problem. The middle stage is the most difficult and most complicated. The person may not know family members, forget how to do simple task, maybe lost even in a familiar places, not only this, there are times that they are agitated, restless, moody and unpredictable. This is a major problem of the caregiver. How to handle the residents in this stage. How to calm them. Medications will make them quiet but we don't like them to be zombies. This is the stage that the caregiver must be creative and intelligent enough to divert their restlessness to a productive one. You must have the proper approach in dealing with them. Try to walk with them, offer them something...to eat or to do...Have patience. If they don't want to eat or they don't want to take their medicines, don't force them. Approach them later, proper timing is important. Play the music...this is relaxing and mood stabilizer. Keep them busy with different activities and this will result to a good sleep. The end stage is a complete lost of memory, judgment and reason. They need complete assistance in their daily living. They forget to talk and to walk This is hertbreaking situations as if there's no more life. The role of a caregiver doesn't stop here. He must give his best to the person to make him feel that life is beautiful. Still they must be treated with respect and dignity.","In Mom's end stages she and I would still go out her in a w/c and walk about town all the while talking to her and letting her smell flowers it was her greatest joy ...nature and gardening besides Nursing YES Always the dignity and Respect for even though they may seem way out there or not there at all they still feel and can get vibes from ppl just as children do Thanks for this thread hun Luvs LYN


 First sign and symptoms of Alzheimer's at first there is no symptoms when brain cells are being d estroyed by AD. LAter on, small memory lapses appear and become serious..They may forget the names of familiar people or places, forget the location of things for everyday use, forget the words to express what they want to say. Is the afflicted individual aware of their signs and symptoms? They are in denial in the early stage, keep on blaming others, frustrations, agitation, rage, with no apparent recogniton that they were once a different person.


 Losing days and objects they have had put away Turning on and off the stove ( reason knobs are off my dads) Wandering .........( sundowning) Dad is never aggressive but does have some severe mood swings like he is calm one moment and then the slightest noise will set him off The doc Mom had was giving her ATIVAN on the side that I never knew about or it would not have been going on It is one of the worst meds for AD ppl..... **Doing a great job MM** Luvs n God Bless LYN


 SYMPTOMS OF MIDDLE STAGE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE * Significant decline in memory. They still know their name but forget their history. they can't follow instruction and think logically. They can no longer track their own belonging. They have difficulty in recognizing faces and names. They are disconneted to reality, disoriented to the days o f the week, month and year. * Problems in communication They can read, but can not respond correctly. The problem in talking and understanding begin. They go back to their first language, and keep on repeating stories and words. * Significant changes in behavior. They might have exaggeration of their normal behavior. they are apathetic, anxious, suspicious, delusional and widtrawn. * Idiosyncratic behavior No longer safe to be alone. They might faall, poison or burn self, or lost. Change in their normal sleep and wake cycle. Sleeping during day time, awake at night. Wandering and talkking to oneself. Needs help in personal and oral hygiene. needs assistance in shower, dressing and using the toilet. * Urinary and fecal incontinence Incontinence increase overtime. Uncomfortable in a chair or toilet. Muscle twitches. I hope this will help.


 SYMPTOMS OF LATE STAGE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE * They can no longer recognize familiar faces, even their family members * They can't smile anymore * Can't comprehend and write * They have muscle rigidity * Cannot walk, stand and sit up * Complete urinary aand bowel incontinence * Difficulty in swallowing, may choke in food and big pills * Can't move voluntarily and stop wandering * Loses weight * Skin becomes very thin * May refuse to eat or drink * Sleeps more, exhausted and tired * Frequent infection * Shut down in sensory organ, the organs might be functioning correctly but the brain can not interpret the input. * Cries out when touched or moved. The late stage of AD is the complete deterioration of the personality. The dying of cells in all part of the brain leads to lack of functioning in all systems of the body. The wild behavior disappear instead they become quiet. They need total care and assistance in the end stage. It's sad and very painful to see your loved one deteriorating and it breaks my heart when I see them in this stage. We have a resident, a 59 year old lady, a former Boeing employee, a smart and intelligent woman who lost everything due to AD. A lot of stories had been said, how AD conquers their lives so I would like to remind you...KEEP YOUR BRAIN STIMULATED.


 CARING FOR A PERSON IN THE END STAGE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Alzheimer's is inevitably terminal. You can delay the progression of the disease but there is no cure. Since AD robs the intellectual capacity to make their own decision, it is important to talk about their choices in the early stage of the disease and prapare a legally binding advance directive. Alzheimer's in the end stage are bedridden and need help with every aspect of daily living. The severity of the disease leads to different dementia-related medical complications such as : * Aspiration pneummonia * Upper urinary tract infection * Sepsis or other infections * Bed sores * Weight loss Hospice care is usually considered in this stage. Hospice care focuses completely on pain management and comfort care. However, it is difficult to predict how long a person with end stage Alzheimer's will live. Usually it is reserved with people who have less than six months to live. SHOW YOUR LOVE TO THEM Although they can't recognized you or could not communicate anymore, there are many ways to feel your love. Alzheimer's in final stage experience their connection to the world through their senses. * Touch ---Hold their hands, brush his/her hair, massage their back, hands, feet. * Hearing---play theiir favorite music, read to them, although they don't understand the words the rhythm can be soothing too them. * Smell ---They enjoy the smell of fresh flower, food and perfume. * Sight---Show them the beauty of nature, the animals, plants, birds, trees, life is beautiful. This is the most difficult journey anyone can take.And the most profound decision is ensuring that the Alzheimer's most basic need for respect, dignity and physical comfort are sustained until the end of life.


 I hope you're recovering now Lyn. I wish you the best and God Bless You for such a good person. If you or a loved one was diagnosed with AD, you may be wondering what to expect with the disease as it take its course. People vary in the length of time in each stage and which symptoms appaear. Sometimes the symptoms overlap so it's difficult to place a person in a particular stage. The stages identify the groups of symptoms that reflect more brain decay. The Alzheimer's death is caused by inability of the brain to keep the body going, or by another disease or injury along the way. PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE At this time, there is no known prevention to AD. Researchers had developed a vaccine that stop the deposits of beta-amyloid in the brain but some people who participated in the clinical trial had experienced serious inflammation of the brain. Although the results were disappointing, researchers don't stop to look for ways to reduce the risk of this disease. Meanwhile research suggests that adults who are more physically active may nto develop AD or dementia as early as adults who are not physically active. There is limited evidence that older adults who stay mentally active may be at lower risk for AD. Regularly reading of newspapers, magazines, books, playing cards, crossword puzzles, going to art gallery, listening to the radio may help you not to have AD. Although this approach has not been proved, there is no harm in putting your brain at work. As we learn more about the possible cause of the disease. we also learn more how to prevent this disease. Research into a vaccine for AD is ongoing.


 OTHER CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Central nervous system condition --- Parkinsons's Disease, Huntingtons's Disease,head injury, brain tumor, stroke Systemic condition-----poor nutrition, dehydration, lack of sleep, high fever, infection, poisoning, hormone imbalance, vtamin deficiencies Subtance-Induced condition-----side-effect of medications, drug interactions, alcoholism or drug abuse Psychologicalstress and psychosis---emotional trauma or stress, clinical depression, schizophrenia or delirium Many of this conditions are reversible if treated early so it's important to seek medical evaluation if you are concerned about dementia like symptoms. Certain emotions might result in dementia-like syndrome--boredom,extreme sadness, loneliness, anxiety, and stress. This condition manifest themselvesi n forgetfulness, memory loss and confusion.


 Every stage varies to different Alzheimer's. It depends how f ast the disease progresses. There are certain factors to consider, the support of the family, the medications and kind of care they are getting. Usually, the middle stage is the longest stage, and the hardest one. The significant changes in behavior and personality occur in this stage. Ativan or Lorazepam is usually prescribed to calm them down when they are agitated, but this is on as needed basis(PRN). Family support is important, they need love, care and understanding. This help a lot.


 You're definitely right SnowyLynne, a person can be in several stages at the same time. Stages are only given to serve as a guidance or to have thorough knowledge to the changes and progression of the disease. Staging system provide useful frames of reference for understanding how the disease may unfold and for making future plans. Not everyone will experience the same system or progress at the same time. Every person is unique.


 FANTASTIC......... Great thread and great input I will let you carry on with this one as I am sure there is more to add I totally agree with you in all aspects Thanks for being here and part of the family Luvsn God Bless LYN


 That's a scary thing. This is a great thread for people who may think they have it or know someone that could have it.


 Personality changes changes in personality and behaviors begin to appear. They become suspicioua, restless and agitated. Some of them becomes combative. Some are hitting caregivers, and become aggressive. . The apathy and lack of engagement begins here. This is very sad to the family.. It;s painful to see your loved one declining./they are restless, wandering and apathetic and widtrawn. They hear see, or smell or t aste sometihng that a re not present. This is the longest stage. They need more understanding, love , compassion and patience in this s tage.


 Replystreet You have NO vested interest in the number or drug co you are posting do you ?? I wouldnt think so BUT I have to ask dont get thinking I am upset lol its just a question hun that has to be asked LYN


 This info is very helpful and I DO appreciate all your hard work and your dedication to this forum Luvs LYN

 THanks for another great post hun Appreciate it muchly LYN


 Thank you for this post it does help to know the different signs of the stages. I guess from reading this and seeing my grandmother she has started the middle stage. She has not forgotten people as of yet even those more recently introduced too (nurses at the hospital etc). On average how long does the middle stage last? how long for the end stage? She has been asking for something to kill herself while in the hospital. I hope so much that the doctors can get her off the adivan which she has been on since the early 90's. Her GP actually increased her dose a few weeks back before this took a sudden change for the worse. I informed my mother about adivan and AD she brought it up at the alzheimers clinic they had an appt with a few weeks back. He suggested a Psych consult to get her off some meds. That appt didnt come due to her getting admitted into the hospital 5 days prior to her appt. I know they were able to take her off of Paxil so far and unsure if they plan on taking the adivan away.


 My Neuro.won't use stages as a person can be in several stages at the same time.


 Yes I totally agree they can be in more than one stage at a time Thanks for all the input and glad to see you reading dragonfly All the best to your grandma and you LYN STAY with us"
For Bedridden Peeps........To Keep Decubiti/Bed Sores in Check,".......When you have a loved one or are the caretaker for someone that is totally bedridden they will have a tendency to break down in the coxic (bottom of tailbone) area.............they should be turned every couple of hours and if you notice skin is getting red and and irritated a good thing to apply is a antibiotic creme(hydrocotisone creme thins the skin)and a gauze pad could be applied for a couple hours at a time but the sore should have some air.Bottom should be kept dry and if you find that depends are to expensive they have ""blue absorbent pads"" that just lay under their botttom ,and these are easier to change without disturbing the person too much..............While working in nursing homes I saw so many of these horrid sores on peeps and alot of the times it was caused by the patient not being changed out of the position for hours on end...............OT just a bit here but kinda a funny story ...was the administrator of a home and before I had gone off shift for the night had asked the nurse on duty to ""turn Ernie""(he had sore) anyways came on in the am and sure enough the nurse had turned him .....she took the bed out with the kitchen staffs help and turned the whole bed around.I could do nothing but laugh and till this day I still tease Brenda about this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If anyone has Q about the decubiti please feel free to ask................Happy Easter to all............and I really want to let peeps that look after their loved ones know that they are heroes in my books it is a hard job but has so many warm and beautiful rewards...........God Bless","....SnowyLynne .great advice see we never lose the ""nursing "" touch you hit on the spots I missed .... ......take care and GOD bless you and hubby ......Have a Great Easter


 For sure sis Another Easter has passed and we have come full circle How ya doing Once the decubiti start they will explode and can go right to bone causing SEVERE pain and sometimes even making AD progress Keep an eye on any open areas


 Please do check your loved one over from head to toe ( just say you will put on her night clothes or whatever ) they cannot stop you Decubiti can get really bad and very quickly ......


 heels,ankles,shoulders,knees,elbows are all potential spots for decubitus if not kept clean & dry & of course turned every 2 hours at least.


 Yes Snowy All those areas are really important as well thanks Welcome to Hw I am so glad you found the breaking down of your Mom's skin and reacted quickily You know the nurses should have been keeping a closer eye and treating considering they ""Knew "" it was bedsores that she had I am very impressed with your wonderful and loving care Please do stay with us and your input is most welcome LYN


 Keeping a bed patient hydrated,turned every one to two hours,& keeping all red areas massaged with a good cream,is a must. The skin must be protected,or it will break down,any red areas not cared for will turn into a decubitus.


 Hey Snowy, Hey Lyn!!! Hope you both had a blessed Easter!! Lyn . . . thanks for the great advice. I didn't realize how often a bed patient had to be moved. It does make sense though. Blessings!


 Padraigs last post has some info about how he saw his wifes bottom and what it looked like


 Think this is very important info please do for your loved one even if they are in homes and if you see a sore on the side they are laying ask nurse or you turn her over ......if small legs use a pillow between to stop knees from bruising and breaking open ....


 Mother been bedridden near a year now and often have seen spots looking like they were turning into something I had never seen before. Nurse told me they were bedsores, though the skin had not broken yet. I bought some Balmex cream and rubbing alcohol. First thing I did was take that diaper off her and expose the area to air for near 3 days. (Just used bed padding instead of diaper and kept her off the spots.) As I saw them improving, I started massaging the areas with rubbing alcohol, patting as well to bring circulation to the areas. Continued this until I saw more improvement, then started using Balmex, putting it on very thickly. Sores all gone now! Keeping a close eye on all parts of mother now and, whenever I see anything looking different, I massage and pat with rubbing alcohol. (Yes, I know it dries the skin. Yes, I also know it helps toughen it.) After which I coat with Balmex. All this seems to be working well!

I NEED HELP WITH MY GRANDMA!!,"I am new to this site. My grandma started having problems a little over a year ago. She started hearing things, like people's voices coming out of the wall. We could not convince her that it was in her head. She felt threatened and heard horrible things. She was even terrified of my grampa. Now she has decided that he is not out to get her, but she is stilll hearing other people in the wall. She keeps calling the police and calling the people she thinks she is hearing and asking them to leave. She has become more disoriented in the past year. Doctors we have talked to say it is dimentia, but since it is so real to her, she does not think she has a problem and will not go to the doctor for it. It is getting worse every week now. I work for my dad in the office out of his house. He lives next door to my grandma so I check on her a lot during the day. Sometimes there is nothing I can do. She gets so frustrated and starts to call people. We are afraid she is going to do something crazy and get committed and we do not want that to happen. We really need to think of a way to convince her she has a problem. She does not really trust any of us any more. We are thinking of having an intervention, and calling her sisters to come visit so that we can all sit down with her at once and tell her we are worried and that we all think she needs to see a doctor. Any suggestions on how to make that intervention successful or suggestions on other ways to get through to her would be appreciated. Thanks.","Hell, Welcome to Healing Well. I am Kitt. I am so sorry your dealing with this difficult problem with your Grandmother. I am wondering if a big intervention would not scare your Grandmother more then if a couple of her closet children sat and talked with her. I would guess the goal is to get her into the physicians office to rule out any other disorder that may be going on. There are members on here that are experts and will have a lot of good information for you. Your Grandmother is lucky to have such a caring and loving granddaughter.


 Thanks so much for replying. I will definately check into some of the threads you listed as soon as I have a chance!!!


 Hi and Welcome I am the caregiver for my dad and looked after my mom tiol she passed away last yr in March.... This AD demetia all the names it can be rederred as is a Horrid disease hun and you need to have support Have you thought about caling some of the places I have listed or have you read some of the older posts that have info........... 'Also there is a fantastic book called """"The 36 Hour Day "" I have re read this book many times and in Our HW resources there is alot of other books as well to look at and other input to help out It is hard to deal with this I know and what is happening to your G is REAL to her it is happening to HER she cannot help this BUT medication CAN most often There are many good meds out there for this problem and for the AD itself ...... I see she doesnt want to go to the doctor ? I would think an intervention may calm you and your other family members but you need also to be careful that she doesnt turn on all of you's and shut you out .that is a distinct possibilty I am sad to say .... You have to keep in mind as well she is believing all are out to get her ......I am so dang sorry that you are dealing with this and your family as well I would not say no dont do an intravention but if you do keep reassuring her that it is out of love for her and I can tel you love her deeply and are scared for her....... PLEASE emial me at your convenience and I can help you out a little more and I am sure others will have some input DO read past post and threads The one that is ""Padraig my wife .my story"" is a good one and he has written a book about his journey with his wife Alos I have one up for ""Caretakers "" and emotions and feelings we tend to go thru PLease DO stay with us and get the support you need God Bless.....

Taking Care and Precautions for the Wandering AD Loved Ones,"From my reading I have come across a very alarming rate of Ad ppl wandering In 1992 32,000 wandered away from their home or a care facility Generally IF found within 24 hrs a safe return is more apt to occur After the first 24 hours goes by and they are not found the survival rate DROPS 46% There are many things that can be done to help with this at the home Install locks on all doors and windows...... Consider putting up fences / cannot keep them in all day when weather is nice Consider Alarms There are also motion detectors that will let you know when loved one gets up and out of bed ... *Also pressure scan mats that are like normal mats but will let you know if loved on is trying to head out the door Erect gates and even the child guards that we use for toddlers to have safety at stairs Safe Return Bracelets can be gotten from the AD society ..call and see what they consist of The ones we have here we normally do put on DOMINANT hand so it cannot be removed Dress them in Bright Colors Keep all keys up and away so thy cannot get to them.... Constant wanderers is a great risk factor for them for sure and above is a few things to help with that Recommended books thru HW Resources Elder Rage .....Take My Father Please How to Survive caring for Aging Parents See resources for more info on this please Will post more I have questions into the Alzheimer's Society and just waiting for them to call me tomorrow","Thats called ""Sundowning"" Lyn.It usually starts in the late afternoons & lasts for several hours maybe longer..........

 thanks snowy i knew that.......i wanted to post to make sure ppl are careful with loved ones be well how is Larry doing BTW


 Lyn, Your info is right on as we had a resident get through security from the nursing home and wander off barefoot. He was found dead sad to say . He had wander a long way in early winter. My husbands Grandmother had this overwhelmingly sad disease and watching my Mother -in-law try to take care of her at home broke my heart. Grandma did not know anyone, just kept asking for Frank her husband who had died already. I admire and support the caregivers of parents, relatives or any loved ones for all they do to to help people living this life of illness. I pray they have good days and that you can see it in your loved ones eyes, some recognition of who you are."
In memory of Pappy,"Hi everyone, I'm new here and I don't talk much, but I am here to talk about my grandfather whom I called Pappy and whom had suffered from Alztimers (I think I mispelled that?) Anyway here it goes. There once was a man named Pappy who loved is family so much. I have known him throughout my whole life from when I was born to the end of his day. Whenever my family and I visited him and his wife, we would always have a good time being together. I remember going to see him and having fun, he would teach us things like how to stack cards, how to play some games, how to not play in the snow for too long, how your not awake until your out of the bedroom, and all kinds of other stuff. He even told some tales about his past when he was younger and how there wasn't any internet. I remember he would always rock me in his rocking chair, even when I got older and bigger he would always rock me. Then 6 years ago, my family and I were moving and my Pappy was in the hospital because he was sick. When we left the hospital my family was crying except me because I didn't understand what was happening, I was surprised that my younger brother was crying too. I would ask why was everyone crying, but they wouldn't answer me until 20 minutes past by. My mother told me that we wouldn't see Pappy again and then I joined the others at crying. After living far away for a few months I had realized that Pappy had Alztimers, when I found out what it was I became sad, but I was always happy to see him whenever we visited him. 3 years ago, my grandfather was put into a nursing home because it became too dangerous for him in the real world. I remember visiting him last summer in the nursing home, he looked so much different from what I had remembered. His eyes had looked sad, his dentures had to be taking away, and he could barely walk. I wanted to cry, but I didn't because in the past before he had Alztimers, whenever someone cried he would cry too. So, I didn't cry, my sister and brother were sitting with our 2 cousins on the other side of the room, trying to not get close to him. I went by his side and let him hold my hand. I would let him hold it until my hand started to change colors. My siblings and cousins left because they didn't want to cry in front of him. I remember when he said my name a few days after visiting him and a tear came down my face, he remembered us for the first time in a long time. I was so happy. When school started I was in my Freshman year of high school and my sister was in her senior year of high school, I remember on Febuary 2 when I was with my friends at school talking when one of my friends came and hug me, saying that she felt sorry for me. I asked her why and she said that my sister told her that my grandfather was in the hospital. I didn't cry since we were still in school. I went home thinking that I was going to cry, but I didn't, why? I didn't know. That day my mom was on her way with her sisters and brother to go see their father. The next day at home my father told me and my brother that Pappy might not make it over the weekend, my brother cried so much and told his friends on the internet that he was scared. I hugged him and let him cry on my shoulder, I kept telling him that everything was going to be alright and a few tears came to my eyes because my brother was crying and I didn't like anyone crying. That night I went on my knees and prayed really har to god, telling him try and try to help my grandfather survive. On Saturday morning around 11:20am, my father woke me up, and told me that he didn't make it. I didn't cry, but when I entered the kitchan to get myself breakfast I asked my father if he past away on a nice day, but he didn't know. Since my grandfather liked sunny days he would be happy, but if it was raining he would be sad. I cried in the kitchen very quietly until I heard my siblings approching the kitchen, then I wipped my eyes and didn't face them since I didn't want them to worry. We then went and bought what we needed and went on a plane. As I looked outside the window I saw many clouds that looked like they were carying angels and coming to greet their newest member. I cried and tried to not let anyone see me, unfortunetly the men who was serving drinks saw me and asked me quietly if I needed a drink, I nodded yes, then he gave me my drink and continued his job. After arriving and meeting our family members and having fun by watching home videos and telling jokes until the day came, the day I did not wish to have. We walked into the building and took off our jackets and walked, I didn't want to see him in a cascet I DIDN'T I DIDN'T I DIDN'T WANT TO!!!!!! but I had to to show respect. When I walked into the room I froze in fear, I saw him laying there with flowers all around him. My mother walked with me to see him, I saw him and noticed that he looked like his old self and was smilling. My mother told me to say Hi, but when I did there was no sound, just movement. I walked away and sat with my cousins. The day went on and I went with my cousin to go say things to him, my cousin didn't say anything, she only cried, but I told him the many things that we have done and what he has done. After that day I had noticed that all my tissues were gone and that my sister had cried so much on that day. The next day was the sme thing, except we had to go in the church. We all went by 2's, I was with my mom near the front of the line and my sister was with my cousin crying and crying while my brother, my father, 2 cousin's, and 2 uncles went and put his case in the vehicle. The rest of my family were all women, I decided before we went in the church to make them happy and not sad and said ""Thank god we have 6 guys"" everyone laughed since it was true and even the man who worked their asked if we had 6 guys on perpose, but we didn't. When we entered the church we did the whole thing and the priest asked some family members to come up and say things, unfortunetly he accidently mispernounced my mother's name and made some people laugh. My mother went up and said the most perfect speech, only a few tears came to my eyes as she read it, and I remember looking at my dad, who had tears coming down from his eyes. After finishing her speech my mother came back to sit next to me and as soon as she sat down she kneeled down on my lap, covering her face and crying into tears. My Aunts were in behind us saying that she did a good job, I rubbed her back and said that she did good. She sat back up and wipe the tears away. After the funeral we went to eat, I remembered asking a few of my family members a question. I had said that everyday you learned something new everyday and on that day when pappy passed away what did they learn from him. They told me their answers and went to asked other family members the same question. Our family members left to go back home and we left on Sunday because we missed so much of school. But while we were still visiting I had learned many things from the day he past away, but the most important one was to never change who you are because it can lead to dangerous paths with your family members or your friends in the future. All and all that is my story of my grandfather Pappy, may he rest in piece.","I am very happy that the two of you are getting your innermost feelings and thoughts out I am so happy that HW has brought you's together to do tthis God Bless LUvs LYN


 NO problem at all HW is the greatest and has helped me in so many ways my friend Keep posting and sharing your thoughts God Bless LYN


 ^_^ yes it is and thank you so much dear sister for letting me know of this site. And thank you Lyn. One day there will be a cure for all diseases, including the ones our loved ones are suffering through.


 Sammy, I am so glad Nikky shared this site with you and not getting much of a chance to talk with you since we lost Pepe I was glad to read your experience. So much of it I can relate to. The memories we shared with Pepe from our horsie rides on his leg, picking strawberrys, to our Christmas Can Can dance! Truley we are blessed to have so many fond and wonderful memories. Everyone deals with greif differently and the fact you were'nt much of a crier doesn't mean you didn't feel the impact of our huge loss. When my Mom called me to tell me that Pepe wasn't doing well I had anxiety to just get to him to be with him, but I didn't cry. Our Mothers made the arrangements for us to head to Maine and I stayed up all night packing. As I was packing I put on a black jacket to see how it looked to wear for his funeral and thats when it hit me and I had my first big cry. When I finally saw him I didn't cry again until the time he passed. Being with him around his passing time Sam I want to share with you that I spent his last night with Pepe, Aunt T, and your Mom. When I looked out the window it was snowing but it was clear out and the courtyard with the tree and gazebo was beautiful. I had left just before he left us and when I got back their was such a feeling of Peace. And by the way it was a cold but sunny day. I think with our family where he was such a funny man we were able to turn our grief quickly into comedy where everyone had such funny memories of him. Going through old photographs where he was always such a ham kept us entertained. The services were hard, seeing him, and having to say our final goodbyes to his body the tears were here and there. I had to try to control myself some however because I gave away all my tissues! lol I loved what he created within our family. The fact we intermingle so well with each other. Some of us don't see each other often but any time we do we see the love within our family doesn't vanish. He's such a family man and seeing us the way we are I know he is one proud man. I remember you asking me what we learned from this and I am not sure what my response was then but I know I've learned a few things. One being the sad fact that no one lives forever. I am reassured that he will be waiting for us when it is our time. Life is to short and we have to do as much as we can to get the best of it. And I don't think that day I learned the following but I know that day I was reminded of the things Pepe taught me about what was important in life. Family, love and togetherness. Home, how to keep a comfortable, clean house. Friendlieness, helpfullness, and humor. Oh their is just so much he taught us. I gotta go and get a few things done. IM or call me anytime Sam I'm always here for you! Love you!! Shell


 thank you Lyn and god bless you as well.


 I am in awe that Healing Well brought you all together to share your feelings. What a wonderful thing. You will carry Pappy forever in your hearts and remember all the good times you shared with Pappy and with each other. Gentle Hugs.


 Skitt about being in awe on how HW brought us toghether just adds to the positive side of the message board and how it helps. We are a pretty close family but half of us live in Maine, and the other half in Florida. So we just don't get to see each other as much as we would like. I found the message board a nice suprise for us to get the opportunity to vent how we felt then and feel now. Thanks to the HW family helps us become an even closer family as we grieve our Grandfather. I know we are getting something out of this and hope in some way our experience can help others as well. Thank You! Shell


 Took me a few sentences to figure out who you were. I started reading it and was thinking... ""Wow this person went through the exact EXACT same thing as me."" Now I know who you are. The sister you are talking about .. is me. I never knew you felt this way. You never came to talk to me. You know I'm always here for you and Alex. When Alex was crying at the computer I just let you guys cry. I knew you needed your moment. I knew eventually you would come and talk to me. Never thought it would be on here but you did. And I appreciate it Sam. And I know that Pappy loves you very VERY much and he's waiting for you in heaven so he can rock you again and sing ""By lo baby"" and tell his stories. And bring us up to date on the new things happening in Heaven and in the world. He'll have an eternitys worth of stories to tell us when we arrive. I couldn't of said any of that better myself. That's how felt and except the only difference between you and I was I did cry. I froze when we entered his room at teh funeral home. I remember smeeling flowers as soon as we entered. I remember our cousin group hugs we would have. And at the end of the service in the funeral home, as we were getting ready to march to the church. I know that he was crying with a smile on his face when he saw us cousins holding each other's hands (snotty or not from nose blowing) and forming a perfect half circle infront of him. Showing him how much we loved each other and how much we supported and were there for one another. I placed my flower on his heart showing him and letting him know that he will always be in mine. He's at peace now and he finally found his mommy. He 's been searching for her throughout his Alzheimer's years (She was dead) and now he's found her and their together at last. Although he wasn't in the hospital when he died Sam. He was still at the nursing home. He wasn't hooked up to any machine or anything. we didn't prolong the suffering. He drifted away naturally and in his sleep. I remember when I was kneeling beside him, I told Michelle when she was with me. ""He's not dead, he's just resting his eyes."" Remember that's what he always told us when we caught him taking a nap in his rocking car? We would hear him snooring away and we'd be like ""Pappy your sleeping."" He would wake and say ""No. I'm just resting my eyes."" Then we would all laugh.


 Thank you Lyn. :D

Rest Homes/Retirement Homes Nursing Homes vs Homecare......Comments,"Always Rosie.......I wanted to comment on what you had said in the post under ""burn out"".......Mom was a nurse in a London Sanitarium(psyche) hospital for many years and then she decided to special in Geriatrics:this was great for her and she loved her work but it also had its d/s, she began to drink heavily after her shift was over (11 7) and moreso if someone had passed away.Mom would be horrified at the way some nurses looked after patients and she became an advocate for their rights.This also put a heavy burden on her as other nurses would not talk to her and she was shunned and labelled a stoolie.My mother instilled in me the ethics of a real nurse and I have the heart of a real nurse (so does SL)You are their for the patient and work for them..........protect them and even love them(even though you are told not too get emotionally att) I always got attached lol..........Anyways my mother father and I have had a written ageement that if anything should happen I will not let them go to a home.I am the eldest chil (51) and I will not put them in one.You are right when you say that some do it just to ease themselves but my sibs have said quite bluntly that because i have crohns that it would be better to put her in a home ......................thats not the reason at all it is to help them not feel guilty for not being there to see her or help with anything .and they live in the same small town...........they will go and see her for what they need if I am not there to intervene but thats it and it makes me furious.For some peeps the nursing home or other facilty is the answer and there are some really good ones out there but for me and because of my mothers fear and the promise I made her and dad that is not something i would do.We (nurses) are trained for situations like this and so the real heroes in my books are the ones that go into caring for their loved ones almost blindsighted BUT with a real and honest concern for the person they care for.........I am not saying by no means that all families have to look after their loved ones again I believe it all depends on the situation,and I think that the facility should be fully checked out and see if it rec its accreditation and there are so many q to ask and find out .For some reason the ""smell "" of a home is a big thing to me and the ""feeling"" I get when I walk in ...I have not taken jobs years ago over these things but thats prob just me.Also I dont think people are bad or wrong if they have to put their loved one in a home as i said it depends on the situation..........sorry for the lenghth of post but I wanted to explain my reason for doing what i do for my mom beside the incredible love i have for this woman ..Take Care and God Bless You and Your Family","With all the HC cut backs it is hard to have a good nh or rh here in Canada rest homes are NOT regulated by any governing agency...it has to be something the Administator asks for .We had ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES,A panel of docs and advocates for the residents at the home I was involved with.This was for the residents sake and for the staff as well as they do get a bum rap at times.Like I had said in previous post there are so many questions that should be asked prior to having your loved one placed.Like who is responsible for handling of of MARS sheets(drug sheets) and drugs.Again here in Canada health care aides do the drug rounds in some homes this to me is a big no no and it is setting peeps up that are not qualified to do the job but are getting MINIMUM wage.This allows the Owner of the home to get away with basically paying diddly for what they would have to pay a Reg. Nurse/or a LPN with pharmacology.Does this sound right to you? When I took over the home those things were first on the list to change there was a qualified person handling the meds on all shifts and had the key to drug cart(if the person who was scheduled was ill /called in then I would do the drug rounds) this keeps all drugs accounted for especially narcotics.Narcotics were counted at the beginning and end of shift (changeover)(usually most narcotics were tylenol 3s but did have morphine for cancer patients) Mistakes were made dont get me wrong but we usually found the reason and if justified the nurse responsible was wrote up.If it occured with the same nurse for 3xs 2 written reports 3rd fired with a written explanation.I must say I ran a tight ship but also we had good repor with the staff and residents.There are alot more q to ask but that one is highly important. Again there are some great homes out there and it is up to the person and families involved. I stress ask ,ask, and keep on asking til you get the answers you want .............Take Care and God Bless You and Your Family


 SnowyLynne ..............It never ceases to amaze me the amount of nurses and docs that are addicts....you figure the high stress working environment+ the availibility of the meds =addiction.I think for me it was seeing and knowing that there were so many addicted because of their committment to caring for patients .like they start out needing that boost because they were on overload,made committments and whatever it took for them to fulfill their obligations took over all sense of reason.I know I have seen too many lose their lives, or jobs, respect of fellow workers basiclly everything and all for that need to get the job done.Most were not able to say no to shifts/worked doubles ect.I was shown first hand what this could do to a warm wonderful,and totally committed nurse (my mom )at the beginning of my nursing career...........she would drink herself into oblivion after her shifts were over and this I honestly believe was a lesson for me .It was definetely a hard lesson for me and the family but a life saving lesson at best.It wasnt pills but an addiction just the same.I dont think peeps really understand unless they are in that position where all those pills are and the temptation ...and the strength to not spiral towards a life threatening situation.....Take Care and Larry too ....God Bless


 In Ontario They are FINALLY bringing in Laws to Regulate Retirement homes and Rest homes Dang well needed IMHO


 bringing up to top


 I agree with you Lyn . . . I think we go by smell instinctively (it is a big clue to the care and attention of the residents AND the facility). Even with one dribbling person, there is odor if he/she is not cleaned up and the floor cleaned up too. We want to keep dad at home as long as it is best for him. Hopefully till the end. I actually pray that God will take him without him having to go through the lengthy, gradual decline that I fear AD will bring. Thanks for your input. Your perspective is good because you have been 'behind the scenes'. Thanks again! Blessings!


 I have A friend whose wife is a drug additct,& an RN,she will never be qualified to work where there are drugs,ever again. Only RN,& LPN(LVN)are qualified to give out medications in the U.S. there used to be qualified medication aides,not any more,at least not in Texas.


 TTT for those wanting to add input


 WE now have Elder Abuse hotline and have found that 90% of cargivers that want to exploit their loved one or the person they look after will 1.....keep them from family .Church ...ect. 2 ......tell them things over and over...... bad things to make them believe that others are out to get them There is so much more going on WE HAVE to be proactive DO they not deserve this ........ to be revered and respected looked up to and learn from even those with AD are not all gone ......"
The Caregiver Also Needs to Look After Own Health,"If you are caring for a loved one on your own or even have some help YOU must make sure you have some"" me"" time this is not being selfish it is actually beneficial to both You cannot be caring for someone 24/7 and not have own needs met Please make sure you eat sleep and have some "" down time"" for self as well The Caregiver can only give so much and yes we do love them with all our hearts but what would they do IF we were taken ill or something happen Keep Eggs in One Basket .......Please look after you too I really do understand the needs and what we give in doing this and the rewards as well It is hard when sick and it is a hard enough road at times Here is to Smart N Healthy Living for the caregiver as well God Bless Lyn","I had to learn the hard way this past while with dad in hospital and me running back and forth between there and 2 households but I did it My health was iffy and I did not contribute as much as I normally do on here BUT I am back Spring is here and it is time for new beginnings and a fresh look at the wonders of His gift of life Love and beauty Love to all LYN


 PLEASE do not feel guilt if you are not able to keep loved one at home due to physical,emotional or financial reasons It is a hard thing to do especially if you are not well yourself .......or if the financial aspect is to much to keep up as well Guilt will eat you apart.......


 Had to have Brother watch dad when I was in hospital all in all he did good


 Howly, I really got ran down over the past 3 years of taken care of my dad and working through the begining stages of EOAD with Larry my husband. When dad died in Oct.

I was always running to the phone as dad had his own number in his bedroom and called me for EVERY thng.lol She figured "" I dided I guess"" lol Sis


 Have started a new thread on Caregivers emotional well being and what they may feel towards their loved ones at times I hope it helps ppl understand that caregivers are Human and have emotions as well and need to address them LYN


 Family members are sometimes not able to cope with this DD but try to educate as best you can Thats all you can do is try LYN


 If you get ill and you are sole caregiver ...........you really won't be any help to your loved ones I implore you to take the ""ME time"" you need.........to keep self healthy for you and them

 Hi ya sis Ya I hear ya there Dad aalways calls me too and he called me for anything and everything for mom as well ......... I have gotten plenty run down BUT like you and the ""energizer rabbit "" we keep goin and goin So glad to have you back posting more I ahve missed you terribly ........ Luvs ya sis Your sis"
Missing you!,"Alright this is my first thread. I would like to say that I know how it is growing up with someone your whole life and then they slowly forget who you are. I was really close to my grandfather. Almost closer then any other of his grandchildren, (except shellee). I moved to Florida about 6 years ago leaving him. But he came to visit with my grandma just about once or twice a year and I went to visit them. 3 years ago he had to be placed in a nursing home because it was just too dangerous for him in the real world. He wanted to stay in a house that he practically build from scratch until he died. But that just couldn't happen. I saw him 4 years ago right before he went into a nursing home. He looked normal and talked actual words and looked as if nothing was wrong with him. and then 2 years later (which was last summer) I went back up north to see him. Words could not explain how I felt. He was soo different. he had lost a lot of weight, he couldn't have his dentures in anymore because they didn't fit and his eyes looked hollow. I wanted to cry soo bad when I walked in that room. They told me sit next to him on the bed and I sat as far away from him as I could. I couldn't process everything. my mind was still stuck thinking.. that's not him. Well I finally caught up and was bitting my tongue so I couldn't cry. well someone noticed and said ""Nikky are you ok?"" I couldn't. I cried out no and walked out of the room. I couldn't. on of my contact lenses fell out cuz I was crying so much. I walked out and my aunt came after me. She said we'd go for a walk so I walked all the way to the end of the hall and waited for them because I didn;t know the code to get out. There was old people staring at me when I was rushing by because I was crying so hard. It didn't really affect my brother and sister until the last day because their younger and whatnot. I don't even think I went back in that room that day. I know I didn't return the next day. I just couldn't. I regret it though. I could of spent some more time with him before he left. But on Febuary third of this year he drew his last breath. When I found out, I did not cry. It didn't feel as if time stopped. It just continued. I felt as if a big weight was lifted from my shoulders. Relif. He wasn't sufering anymore. He was in heaven and back to normal. He knew what was going on and who we were. He is always with us. I graduated a fe weeks ago and I knew he was there. He would of given everything to be there. And he was. I cried at his funeral yes but after that, I was happy. I knew he was happy to see me happy. He is what, I think, brought the family closer together. Over the last few years we have united way more then before. Especially us grandkids. We get along great and we're pretty much each other's best friends. It's great! Here is a few poems I wrote in his honer. The first one is entitled ""My Special Hero"" (This was before he died) The following poem your about to hear might make you cry, I'll tell you all right now, none of it is a lie. It's about the hero who never faught, It's about the hero I love a lot. He has a wife and five kids, who now have all grown, They now have children of their very own. His name is Normand and his wife's name is Shirl, The first child they had was a baby girl. What name should they give a child so serene? They thaught up the name, Shirlene. After Shirlene was Kathey, Roger and Terry, For their final child's name was Debbie. In a small house is where this big family lived, A bigger house was what Normand wanted to give. For years, he made that small house bigger With old wood he foudn that was just a bit bitter. He hammered through the morning and night, He wanted the house to be just right. When he finished he stood back and admired his work, An on his face he had a huge smirk. What us to be a house with 3 bedrooms and a closet sized bath, With this new house Normand and his family could start a new path. He raised his children doing his very best, For he has a big heart which lies within his chest. He has eleven grandchildren who love him very dearly, For the first one's name is Michelle followed by her sister Ashley. After Ashley was Tara, Tyla, Teddy, Nikky and Ian, But that's not all there was still Sammy, Jesse, Alex and Caitlynn. Nowadays Norman doesn't remember all their names, His mind was taken by which Alzheimer's now claims. He can't remember his days from the past, In my mind is were they shall last. There is so much more to add to this long story, about my hero and all his glory.","Welcome hun I am so sorry for your loss mom passed inMarch of 2006 and my dad is just about there as well I do and did look after both parents in their home I was able to financially and emotionally as I am a geriatric ( retired nurse) but many cannot .....

 Thank you guys so much. You really never notice how much you love someone until their final years. It was a though run but I know he did it for us. He was always a fighter and was always up for a challenge. To me, he could do anything. To me he didn't lose his battle with Alzheimer's. He faught it everyday to stay alive. Everyday he survived was a victory. His mind just left before his body. I have so many memories with him I could write millions of books with it. I just might write one someday. Who knows. He will be my inspiration. He has been for everything else I have accomplished. He told me to follow my dreams and not give up. I know he's behind me every step of the way. I have a section on my bedroom wall that's dedicated to him. Although since I just moved it's not much at the moment. Just a cross, his obituary and drawing my friend made me a while back that says ""I love you!"" I'll try and scan it someday and show you all. He taught me soo much and one thing that sticks out the most that he taught me physically was to mow the lawn and hammer a nail, which has come in handy with set building for a play. But mentally he thought me that life has many challenges and to just take them one step at a time. Hold my head up high and know that nothing is impossible. I'm sorry to hear about your mom and your dad. I know how you feel. I find it great that you took care of them. Your a though girl who has a lot of love and cares very much. ... God Bless You. stkitt- Thank you. I do feel very welcomed here. I have found people who truely understand how I feel. my ex-bff never understood. (She's an ex because... it's a loooonnnnggg story and I feel much better without her around.) I would try to express myself and tell her how I felt and she would either ignore me or turn it all around and make herself seem like the victum talking about her mother and her family problems. No support from her. When I came back from Maine in Febuary I tried to tell her things that went on up north and she just blew me off. I was soooo stressed out that month that I officially changed the name of it from Febuary to Hell (pardon my language). I came back sick as ever, went to school the next day tired and sick (theres a rule that if you dont show up to school then your too sick to go to an after school activity) and since I was made director for a one act play 2 weeks before my grandpa's passing, I had to go to school, then go to a dress rehersal that night. Do the same thing the next day except it was an actual performance. and I also had rehearsals after school for a different play that I was in and I had a weeks worth of choreography to catch up on. That tuesday night after the performance I left and went straight to the doctors. I found out i had an ear infection in both ears. Snow isn't my friend at the moment lol. But what hurt me the most was when my ex-bff said that I changed. That I was a completly different person. I wanted to yell at her and say ""My grandfather just died what do you expect?"" but I kept my mouth shut. I'm back to the person I use to be just a little more ... emotional? I see something sad and want to cry. I can't explain it. If you want to hear about my ex-bff just message me. I'll be glad to share with you all. And thank you all again sooo much for ALL your support. Nikky


 Nikky I look at Moms pic on my walls and say the same I talk to her in a thread about what is going on and for me it works I am glad you are findingHW supportive and theppl empathetic Stay with us sweetie k Some ppl just dont and never will understand ...... God Bless LYN.


 So glad to hear it ........ I am really getting to know you thru your poems and posts I believe you are an asset to the forum....... Luvs ya Lyn Add any input or threads on info you would like to share God Bless LYN


 Nikky, Being your cousin I had the advantage of reading your poems before you posted them and knowing our grandfather personally they touch my heart every time I read them. The accuracy and word display hits alot of my same feelings. Reading your posts I am glad I showed you this message board and am sorry that I didn't sooner. I don't write in here often, but I read things often. It amazes me still all the similarities people have when dealing with AD. Their are many caring, helpful, and supportive people in the group. My heart goes out to each and everyone that is involved with loved ones having AD and the loss from the disease. We know how it is, and know their is only so much we can do, and I'm glad we have this board to help us pull through. I'll stay posted, and will talk with you later! Love you! Shell


 Asset meaning you are good for this forum sweetie ......


 NO problem Truth is always my way sweetie God Bless LYN


 Sorry that was a long post. Here is a few that I wrote after he passed away. ""Life After Maine"" Living life so full of fun and laughter, I wish I knew before what happened after. Not wanting to die the way he did, Going back in time to when he was just a kid. Forgetting people as the disease went on, The memories he had with his family were gone. Something happened one day, Febuary third to be exact, all the memories he had lost were back. Not knowing if it was good or bad, What happened that day was very sad. Normand passed away in his sleep, Leaving all his possetions for his family to keep. His baby doll is what I'll keep forever, But between you and me, my memories of him are better. In heven now is where he resides, Sharing sotries with god sitting by his side. waiting patiently for us to join him, He'll be the first to great us with a grin. Now our guardian angel he will be, Taking care of you and me. This next one I just wrote today. ""Missing you!"" I am waiting until the day I wake, To find out it's all a dream, Your still here alive and well, But nothing is as it seems. You have gone and passed away, Leaving me behind to grieve, But yet there's something else I feel, mSomething other's would call ""Relif"". Why should I feel this way, Knowing you just passed? Because I know your not suffereing, At peace you are at last. Together one day we will be, After I grow old and die, I know you'll wait for me, So for now I'll say good bye.


 HI and welcome to Healing well. You have said it all in your poems, you feelings and love for your Grandpa shine through. Keep posting here as the support is wonderful and this group will help you so much. Lyn is amazing and the best woman you will ever find. Again welcome.


 Also since his wall seccion is by my door Just about everytime I leave my room or enter I say hi to him and that I love him. To me that let's him know. I know he knows even if I say it on here but for some reason if I don't say it to a photo of him or something like that to me he doesn't hear me.


 Thank you lyn. I do plan on staying on HW and help others as well.


 I'm an assest?.. sry im confused.


 I love you too Shell!


 Ooooooooohhhh ok. Thank you :D"
new to this group,"I entered this site, curious about the support out there, the support I didn't know about when caring for my own mother for the last two years of her life. I was her sole caretaker, with my 90 year old father's help, and the struggles and frustrations were many. It has been a year since I lost my mom to this horrible disease and still wish that I could know if she was aware at all that I was with her in her bedroom, here in her home, when she died. Did she know she was surrounded by family at that time, or was her brain still telling her she was without family? It will haunt me forever, I'm afraid. Again, just curious to read some of your postings and find some parallels to my own experiences.","Survive , welcome to Healing Well. So glad you found us! This is a great site with wonderful caring people. You won't be disappointed. I am sure that your Mother knew you were present with her many times and I know how you feel. You just have to believe that she left this world in peace knowing how much you loved her. My son was killed instantly in car accident and I was devestated and worried that he did not know how much I loved him. But I have come to accept that he did and I still tell him everyday. My husband's Grandmother had Alzheimer's for 10 years before she died in her 90s. My mother-in-law went everyday to feed her lunch and eat with her. She did not know who she was but sometimes her eyes appeared to recognize my mother-in-law for a few seconds and then she was gone again. So, please believe your Mother felt the love surround her. You are a special person to care so deeply for you Mother. Bless you.


 Hello Charlie, Thank you for your comments. I read your entry with great empathy and emotion. I can still see and hear my Mom asking for her father, looking around the house for her brothers, and wondering who would milk the cows if she didn't get going. As you know, their ""present"" changes sometimes by the hour, and later in the day she might be looking furiously for her lesson plan books to get ready for her teaching assignment the next day. It made me so sad and useless for awhile until I learned to join her reality, wherever she was. I found that telling her repeatedly that her family had been gone for years was not only troubling to her, but that she wouldn't remember it. So we talked about her father, where he was and if her mama was too busy to talk or help us make applesauce. After I learned to giver in to her reality, I was able to find comfort in her presence because she was comfortable. As much as I wanted to shout out that her granddaughter was graduating from college and how proud I was of her, that her grandson was being a wonderful father to her only greatgrandchild, and that her greatgrandchild was named after her and was such a delight....I had to keep those things I so wanted to share with my mom to myself. Instead we stayed in her reality. How I would have loved to get a hug from my mom to me, not to the woman taking care of her. But at least she saw me as a good person, not her daughter, but a good person nonetheless. Fortunatley, up until her death, she always saw me as one of the good guys. I know I was fortunate to have that. I commend you for all the loving care you are giving your wife. Removing her from the nursing home, and putting her in, had to be two enormously difficult and heartwrenching decisions. Keeping our loved ones in their own home is a gift that not everyone can give for many reasons. I happened to be able to take a leave from my teaching job, had my house sold almost immediately, and could financially take the hit of not bringing in an income in order to care for her and Dad. Friends tried to deter me because of the loss of income from my job, the back steps I was taking in my career, and the lonliness I was sure to face, but somehow I just knew it was right. Holding my Mom in my arms when she passed and capturing one of the four tears that came just seconds afer her last breath....that is what has given me a gift that is both precious and has also left me in this limbo of not quite knowing how to get back into the real world. Grieving her loss, and then my Dad's, has been hard. I had Dad as my Dad, with very little senile decline (he was 90) and we had conversations and memory sharing. WHen he was gone, everything was so empty. The house is smpty in so many ways, yet filled with many memories, frustrations and most of all LOVE. They are gone, but will always be here and I know I honored what they most wanted and that was to die in their own home, one they had built just so that would be possible. So this morning I am looking out at the mountains from the window that Mom had the architect put in such a place so that she had maximum exposure to the mountains and not the neighborhood down below. I sip the same tea from her favorite tea cup and gaze at this beauty she left me to enjoy. Stay strong and know there are many people helping you in our own way..... LE


 Wondering how you are doing God Bless LYN


 Hun I will be totally honest here as always I cry everyday for mom and I look out my window and see the house she and dad had lived in for over 30 yrs ......... I feel into a severe and I mean severe depression about 5 mths after she had passed away...... I have had no real closure with Mom's passing there is ashes now but my sis ( BTW never took the time of day for mom nor dad) has them and has supposed to be bringing them to me for a month now ........ya right...... I tend to her rose garden and to the other things she so dearly loved It is hardes to lose your Mom IMHO and I think to me anyways it is because we no longer have that "" where we have comefrom connection"" IF that makes any sense to you ..... I had lost my Grama almost 2 yrs to the day of Mom and mom died on the day I buried my first husband in 1979 Alot of pain and memories of all came flooding back I too despise this DD and I wish I could have mom back to as she used to be active laughing and just a wonderful woman ........... We have so much in common my friend........ Know I am here for you PLEASE and will be til you tell me otherwise Take care and let me know how today goes Read my thread to MOm ""Almost a yr"" and if you want start one of your own it helps me immensely to talk to her thru this or just go on same thread I will bump ?bring it up for you God Bless hun I DO feel your pain and sadness and hatred for this DD that robs us and them God Bless LYN


 Hi, not sure if I should comment or not. I had severe dementia a couple of years ago. Lost 80% of my memory at the time, getting much better now. I know at times I thought I was 18 (actually 36), couldn't understand who some people were (like my kids), couldn't understand why everything looked different and got mad at the changes, didn't understand what people were saying but very keen on the feelings in the atmosphere, got lost all the time walking on my street (I have lived there 31 years) and sometimes in my house.. I could go on and on... I guess I just wanted to say is that the people who were with me day in and day out I knew even though I couldn't place how I knew them. What they said to me or in conversation, it took a long time, effort and energy to figure out what they were talking about . Like an animal though, I could sense if they were angry, happy, sad or excited. I think I got fear and excited confused though. I just didn't always understand their reasoning or what ideas they were trying to convey. I understood simple directions, although I would forget midstream sometimes. I knew who loved me and who didn't. People I don't know still come up and talk to me as if they knew me all their life and know personal details about me. But I don't know them, sometimes a face seems familiar and that is about it. I know if they are nice or not nice. That is about it. I knew my sister-in-law back then as the nice lady who took care of me. I didn't know her as family, just the person who fed me and took care of me (and apparently my kids too). My daughter then 8, I couldn't understand why so big for age 2, my sunshine, and sometimes she was someone I didn't know just some pesky kid that kept coming in my room. My son David was a year or so then. I didn't know him at all. (It kills me now to think about it). I know he was a good baby. It seems like my head didn't know things, but my heart did. Your heart knows people you love and it never changes - even if you don't fully recognize them and have periods of mixed emotions. Now I see my kids and it is like that period of my life never happened, I recognize them fully just like I did prior to the dementia. ALthough we all know it did happen and there are a lot of fences to mend from it. I am extremely spiritual now. I believe there is an essence or spirit in us and once there is a connection or strong relationship between two people it will never go away. It may change, it may regress and it may grow, but it will always be there. Your head just processes things...your heart knows things.


 To all my brothers and sisters here on the site, we are connected in such a way only those who have walked in our shoes can relate, oh they mean well , they say I am sure you'll be alright or yes I lost a family member....But until you have walked down this road so traveled these days with sorrow , with love, with loss and with at times anger oh they can not possibly know the walk.. To all those who have and will be on this journey my prayers and thoughts are with you all. Renee aka Chillkoot


 Hi surviveandthrive, Your post struck a cord with me. I've been racking my brain about the accepted notion, that people affected with Alzheimer's wish to 'go home'. I have found this with my wife in the early stages of the illness. She wanted to be back home with her Mom and Dad where she knew she belonged, was wanted, protected, safe and no worries about trust. Of course her parents were no longer, nor was the home she grew up in. Now I see the most important thing is winning her whole hearted trust. I'm now aware I lost that when I placed her in a NH, hence her giving up on life and not eating and drinking. After taking her back home it took a good six months of efford to get her to eat and drink. Some meals took as long as two hours! Now more than four years on, the same meal will take half an hour. Though she's incapable of speech or movement her eyes and face speak volums. She responds to my touch and puckers up to my kisses. Emotions only dies when the person dies, we tend to forget we are human Animals, and as such have a sense of feelings that has become dulled once we leave childhood. See the child, it's aware of good and bad vibes, these become keener in those afflicted with Alzheimer's. I'd say your Mom knew of your loving care. It's NOT 'it MUST be possible', it IS possible to survive, I'm a surviver, you will be. My best wishes to you. Padraig


 Welcome I lost mom just over a year ago to this DD and complications I look after my father now and am sole caregiver KNOW please know with all your heart and soul SHE was aware of your love and caring even with this DD that robs us of them ....... A simple touch means so much to those we care and love and look after that have this .....it really does make a difference I am so sorry for the loss of your mom too I know firsthand how you feel and I am with you in heart and spirit ...... God BLess LYN


 Know you are truly an inspiration to us all that look after our loved ones at home ........ I too was able to do this with no real problems caused in my life I had promised Mom I would never put her in a home Both her and I were Geriatric Charge nurses........ I do feel bad for those that cannot look after their loved ones at home PLEASE do stay with us ........


 HowLyncat... Dear Lyn, Thanks for checking back in. It's as tho' you were reading my mind. This last week has been extremely difficult and I can't put my finger on it. Every time I think of Mom, and that seems to be extremely often, I start to cry. I cry out of missing her, out of the not knowing how she really was, what she was really aware of, the injustice of robbing my Mom of her precious memories and out of the dream I have that would be to have just another conversation with my Mom, before the disease took that part of her away. As many people who have lost loved ones to this disease, we keep journals for our own sanity and to remember and chart the progression of the disease. I was adding some post script s to what will become my own book and included a photo I took of her, one that I used at her memorial service. I took that picture just 9 days before her death. I had just brought her home from getting her hair done, she was wearing her favorite pink sweater, her beautiful white hair was shiny and reflecting the sun as she sat in her favorite chair in the solarium, looking out at the mountains. She wasn't necessarily wmiling, but she has a very peaceful look on her face. All I could do when looking at that picture again was wonder if she REALLY was peaceful or if she was inside yelling to get out so that she could fix her own lunch, tend to her own garden, make her own bed, and do for others which is what her life was all about . Was she angry I was in HER kitchen, in HER garden, in HER bedroom or was she peaceful? Before the Alzheimer's became limiting as far as her physical activity, she remained very physically active, even though she did pretty random things. But she was never still...always looking for something to do, someone to help etc. But when the inactivity started, I can't imagine how frustrating that was for her. No longer able to move about at her own free will, no longer able to do what she wanted, no longer able to remember. I just hate this disease and am so angry she had to be a victim!! I don't want my Mom with Alzheimer's back, because I really do not believe she was happy. But I want my 91 year old, feisty, full of advice, nurturing and loving Mom back. Again, thanks for your concern. I am going to get by alright. I always do.


 Surviveandthrive Just checking in to see how you are doing my friend Post when u can plz LYN


 THanks for that It is SO TRUE I go on each day knowing Mom knew and dad does as well Again thanks kris God Bless LYN


 There is no cure for Alzheimer's or dementia but meds can help,but in time things will progress......."
I would like to share this with you....,"I thought we could have a thread where people can post things like this. I want to share with you a song I heard and also two poems that were written on the back of the ""A Celebration of life"" cards (The little card thingies you get at at the funeral home. I don't know what they are called. These we're two different ones for my grandpa. First one: Your gentle face and patient smile with sadness we recall. You had a kindly word for each And died beloved by all. The voice is mute and stilled teh heart, that loved us well and true. Ah, bitter was the trial to part from one so good as you. You are not forgotten loved one, nor will you ever be. As long as life and memory last we will remember theee. We miss you now, our hearts are sore. As time goes by we miss you more. Your loving smile, your gentle face. No one can take your vacant place. The second one which I thought told more of him: God saw you were getting tired, And a cure was not to be. So he put his arms around you, And whispered, ""Come to me."" With tearful eyes we watched you, And saw you pass away. Although we loved you dearly, We could not make you stay. A golden heart stopped beating, Hard working hands at rest. God broke our hearts to prove to us, He only takes the best. Here is the song: (it's from his CD we made for him. This was the song I picked) ""Heaven was needing a Hero"" I came by today to see you, Oh I had to let you know. If I knew the last that I held you was the last time, I'd of held you and never let go. Oh it's kept me awake nights wondering, Lie in the dark just asking why. I've always been told, you wont be called home, until it's your time. Chorus: I guess heaven was needing a hero. Somebody just like you. Brave enough to stay up for what you believe. And following through. When I tried to make it make sense in my mind The only conclusion I come to, Was heaven was needing a hero like you. I remember the last time I saw you, Oh you held you head up proud. I laughed inside when I saw how you were, Standing out in the crowd. Your such a part of you I am. Now that part would just be void. No matter how much I need you now, Heaven needed you more. Chorus: Cuz heaven was needing a hero. Somebody just like you. Brave enough to stay up for what you believe. And following through. When I tried to make it make sense in my mind The only conclusion I come to, Was heaven was needing a hero like you. Yes heaven was needing a hero.. that's you...","It's one of my favorite songs. I'm actually listening to it right now. It makes me happier.


 right.


 :D Thank you Lyn.


 Tests for what? Hope all turns out well for you Lyn. I am happy you made memories with your mother. And that your making some more with your father. I cannot imagine how I would be if either one, or both of my parents passed. I would be a total mess.


 So beautiful Yes please do share all Thanks so much for sharing this with us It sure hit a place in my heart God Bless LYN


 It is good to get something to make you happy we cannot dwell nor live in the grief for all time Yes I know it is darn hard but he would want you to LIVE and have fun and laughter right Take care sweetie God Bless LYN


 Be well and have good memories Know he is up there smiling down and watching over you ......


 Honey I am 53 and I still miss Mom so bad it rips me apart BUT I take the ""Good and Funny"" memories and make the best of each day We had made many of them Thank God I am still able to make memories with dad but he is going to be gone soon I know this in my heart ....... He misses Mom so much and he wants to be with her ....they were together from the age of ( 8 yrs old ..........me) Long time and so much love and caring for one another in all those beautiful yrs Be well God Bless ** I will be on tomorrow night I have more tests to go thru tomorrow am ...had a lot today already.... Be strong and remember the good times and laughter LYN IN my heart and prayers .......


 Sweetie every day is a struggle with Mom gone but I know she is no longer in pain and like your Pappy she is always with me My dad and I have been so close all my life as well and I know that when he goes I will be a BASKET case for sure Tests for some problems I am having Take care Luvs ya LYN"
it all adds up,"Lyn, as a followup to your post to me about how I am doing: I wrote a rather long reply and was confused about why things were so bad for me lately and then felt very selfish. After all, my caregiving days are over and I am left with memories, good, sad, frustrating but overwhelmingly great. I know, after writing back to you, why things are so difficult for me right now. Suffering from Anxiety/panic disorder and depression, I have just been incredibly down. With my anxiety disorder, I tend to hide away and become very reclusive when the panic and anxiety start to well up. That is what I have done. Being prone to agoraphobia, I should not do this. but I have not left the house in over two weeks and have even cancelled doctor appointments because I am ashamed to admit how low I have gotten. What a curse, shame. I do it to myself, and I am very good at it. So, after writing back to you, I reread what I wrote and had one of those lightbulb moments: I called and made an appointment with my psychiatrist and therapist for this afternoon, after telling the receptionist how bad I was. What a good thing to do. With the appointment coming within hours, I cannot cancel w/out having to pay a huge late cancellation fee which insurance doesn't cover. So I will go. I will clean myself up, force myself into town, and let my doctor know how bad things have been. Surely, things will improve then. Admitting a big slump is half my battle to getting through it. So thanks again. It gave me a push to figure all this out. HOPE......... LE","I am so pleased you had your .....AH HA moment my friend and even more pleased that you are going to go to this appointment It is going to be rough I know this for you BUT know I am on your shoulder and with you in Spirit (hmmmm I dont think we need to tell Pdoc that lol) Please keep me in the loop I do know some of what you are feeling I was a geriatric charge nurse and Nurse Aide before that as well did Home health care so I too am grieving the ""loss"" of what my day was filled with and the love and caring I had for all those ppl I looked after I do feel your pain .... I am so PROUD of you Hold your head high hun You are taking steps and thats the best way to go at this ........ Luvs LYN"
My Nan has Alzheimers ..,Is she not on medication to help her?,"Brought forward some threads that may help you LYN


 I am sure there has to be something that will or would help her with the really bad times ...... What is the antidepressant she is on if you dont mind?? I am sorry that your family does not help you I know firsthand how that feels I loked after MOm until her passing and now Dad and I am sick with Crohns as well as other diseases but they just do not 'Get It"" Respite care would be good for her she could make some friends be involved in some activities with ppl her age and so on I would be putting my foot down if I were you as you are the one caring for her.........it is easy for them to say no they dont look after her nor are they being called home from work .......or have an illness like you Many family members are like ours ...they tend to lave everything to one person and yes it is a great time to make memories and share in her life but it is also very physically and emotionally draining at times Keep with us and post again Have a good day ......... LYN


 So TRUE.....Family members that do not see them daily do not see the changes that seem to occur everyday I am glad that your Nan does go out giving you time to self......... And I too have found that some of my siblings DO NOT accept the fact that Mom was with AD nor that Dad has it now ........maybe they dont want to I see and know due to yrs of working as a Geriatric nurse and it was hard for me to accept that Mom had become stricken with the same disease that she worked with ppl in the same field as I all her life Mom was the best as a nurse and a person with plenty of TLC to go around she was working in the office of my Retirement home when I started to notice things were just not ""right"" with her .......'Sad it was ...... Dad has gotten worse since she passed away still in his mind he thinks at times I am her and it is heartwrenching when he calls me Judy ..... But I will go to his level on very many things I do not let him think I am Mom I dont believe that is right and I say ....Dad its me Lyn......he justs says"" Oh yah I forgot ""......and we carry on It is a hard road and load we carry hun but as I have said always at least I am and did make many a good memory with Mom and I am now with Dad ...................my siblings are missing out on that and it is so sad Stay strong and know I am here if you need me and if you need to my email is under name okay You are sure not alone on this God Bless........

 Hey iv popped over here from the depression forum, thought i would post here too. Well im 24 from UK and i have my nan living with me, she was diagnosed with Alzheimers about 5 years ago now. it hasnt been really bad, docs say because shes so active its held off, but the past couple of months have been really hard, im findin it hard to keep my temper, she is hard work! I work full time and i share the care with a cousin of mine - who gets paid for it! but as my cousin has children and i dont, she seems to leave all the work for me, she doesnt show her face from one day to the next unless she wants something! its getting me down, its all on my shoudlers. And at the moment my nan has such strong obsessions! the plugs have to all be turned off, wether we r in the room or not, im sick of findin the fridge turned off! all the lights in the house have to be off unless we r in the room, the house is in darkness!! all windows have to b locked even when we r in the house! she checks how hot the radiators are every two minutes,.. and much much more !! And my cousin doesnt work at all and her youngest just went to preschool so she has free days now.. but its me my nan rings beggin me to come home because she cant turn tv on or this n that! She isnt fully dependant on me yet, she can go out on her own, shoppin and she goes bingo or visits the neighbours, but iv noticed that its gettin less and less. arghhhhhhhhhhhhh !!! sorry! i needed to vent it all out somehow! dont get me wrong, i love my nan to bits and i dont mind caring for her really, its just so hard at the moment, and i have my own problems too at the moment! xxxxx


 I hope she is on meds I am really sorry that you are dealing with this and I really think it is time you put foot down to PAID cousinn and let her know you cannot come home from work all the time and you need the help......... If your nan is not on any meds I would suggest a visit to her Doc or Neuro and get her on something it is starting to get out of hand for her and you She doesnt realize what she is doing most of time with lights ect...... I know it has to be frustrating for all Have you checked into RESPITE care for a day or 2 week so you have down time as well?? Please do stay wit us and keep us posted okay LYN


 hey, thanks howlyncat :) Well no my nan isnt on meds for her Alzheimers, only ones for her Heart trouble and Anti-depressants, when she was diagnosed the doctor said she was too far gone for any meds to do her any good, said there was nothing they could give her, we didnt believe her so we went to my nans consultant who told us exactly the same, they said that she has past the early stages a long time ago so nothing would do any good, they say there is something for her when she is in the very late stages but nothing until then. Last year she was so bad with her obssesions and worryin about everything, she was always tryin to start a fight! so we went back to the doctors and theyv gave her anti-depressants to calm her down - they have worked thank god but she still has her moments! As for the respite, iv tried talking to my family before about it but no one is interested they only want family to care for her but noone else can be bothered but me, i didnt really have a choice, my nan has always lived with my family but when i was 19 my parents decided they needed a bigger house and they moved out with my brothers and sister and i was told i HAD to stay here and look after nan, so here i am 5 years later still in the same situation. Hope that all makes sense im in a rush lol Thanks for ur replies :)


 The Anit-depressant she is taking is called Mirtazapine. I do get a break on a Sunday, one of my Aunts takes her out to bingo for the day and she has dinner there, and for two hours of a Monday she goes to an over 50s club and they take them out on day trips sometimes in the summer. Its hard with the family because they dont see the changes in her everyday like i do, i have told them what shes like, i think deep down they know shes getting worse but they would rather believe she wasnt! Shes 80 in August bless her


 hey lyn, Sorry to hear about your mum and dad, you sound like a wonderful person caring for your mom and now your dad. I know what you mean with ur dad calling u by your mums name, my nan calls me every family members name going, last week it took me two hours to convince her that i had a younger brother, the only way i could get her to realise i did was to ask him to come visit her, when he came round it was like we hadnt even had the conversation, my brother thought i was messing with him when i told him! I also think she is trying to hide how bad it is getting, when she forgets someone or something and we talk about it she then says 'oh yeah of course i know now' but i know really when i look at her face she still hasnt got a clue, so i just drop it. Like i say it has held off for years now but the last few months i have seen a lot of change in her it makes me sad. but she is so stuburn, she resists help anyway she can. We found out she has cataracts in one of her eyes, it is so simple to fix but shes refused it, she has got about 18 months and then it will HAVE to be sorted. She isnt too well at the moment, she has a bad cold and said she feels under the weather. anyways i best get back to work!!

If u want to email me, iv added my addy to my profile Best go sort dinner out for my nan. Bye for now xxx


 Lil Angel Thanks for asking I amnot doing to bad I am now trying to deal with my daughter Cait ...she has strep thraot and a viral infection in chest sounds kinda like a croup cough and hurts me to see her so sick and orn out ....giving her plenty of Vitamin ""C"" as well as other meds the doc ordered her for the temp and headaches /sore swollen thraot One thing after another BUT I know God never gives me more than I can handle right ,,,,,,,,, My mom always put things away so they were "" safe"" lol but she never remembered where either I have found plenty of things she stored away since she passed I know I am the one that looks the most like Mom have her big brown eyes and most of her features so it does kinda throw dad off it hurts yet it also makes my heart swell at the same time .....does that make sense ........ Mom did and dad does same thing about convos he will say Oh ya I remember now but like you say just one look at their faces tells you different Most times it is better to go to their world ......it wont hurt them and somehow it helps the connection IMO.. I am sure others would differ but I have always done this even when in Nursing so habit is hard to break and I feel it is a good one anyways for me ...... So sorry about your Nan and I sure hope she doesnt catch this horrid viral thing gaoing around all over the world right now (even flu shot is not preventing it ) ...........just make sure she is well hydrated and if not to hungrgy make her those shakes and the ice cream wont hurt If no allergies to Peanut butter you can make really quick n easy SOFT PB cookies full of many nutrients for her 1 egg 1 cup of peanut butter 1 cup of sugar Mix with a fork and spoon onto a tray cook at 350 degrees for 6 to 8 minutes ** dont press them down let the spoonful just be on the tray ** I made these all the time for mom and make them occasionally for dad Daughter loves them too Thoughts and prayers are with you and your sweet nan God Bless LYN


 Hey Lyn, Not long got in from work, shattered! Things are going great with nan, shes been in a really good mood past couple of days, its been lovely, can have proper conversations with her, although more and more things keep getting put in a 'safe' place eyes . And she gave up smoking about 10 years ago due to medical problems, but recently she keeps telling me shes craving for one. Things arent too good with me, depression and other things are getting to me at the moment, s'pose its everything getting on top of me. Just feeling really down sad Sorry to hear about ur daughter being ill, hope she gets better soon. How are things with you and your dad? Thanks for that recipe, will have to try it xxxxx

 Dear Holyncat I am sorry that you are feeling so sick.


 How are you making out Lil Angel, Catwhispers and Kitt??"
Help me please!!,"Hello all! My dad is an Alzheimer’s patient. He has been taking a medicine called Risper…something like this Risperdal, I think since some 5 months and now the doctor has prescribed him Ebixa. He has been taking this since last week and yesterday I noticed a lump that has developed on his head. I read the side effects of Ebixa and nothing of this sort has been mentioned. Could it be that dad is allergic to the medicine? I phoned the doc yesterday buy he is out of town. I don’t know what to do in this situation…Should I stop giving him this drug? Post Edited (Sonia_F) : 6/21/2007 5:09:08 AM (GMT-6)","In Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, we have medical walk-in clinics in every neighbourhood. I have always found them to be very good. If your own doctor isn't available, it's the way to go. I think Lyn is right that it's probably a bump, but why not have peace of mind by having someone check it out? Mary


 Hoping you read this thread again / we have these walk in clinics here in Ontario Canada as well Lyn


 I would call the ER and ask a triage nurse or the Doctor on call there if it is scaring you that much What type of lump and where is it Did he perhaps bang his head?? sorry for all the ?? but I dont think the med would cause theis hun BUT like I said please do call a doc at the ER just for your own peace of mind You please take care and let me know how you and him make out God BLess LYN


 I too have never heard of meds.for AD causing lumps or bumps.I was on Aricept for 4 yrs.then Razadyne for 6,no problems like that.........."
A healing moment,"To those who know my story, I sold my home and moved across state to live with my parents to care for Mom with Alzheimers and Dad with some dementia and other health issues. I was their sole caregiver for two years and lost my Mom to Alzheimers last March with Dad following to be with her 7 weeks later. I am still having a hard time with the grieving and with the emotional cost the caregiving and eventual loss has had on me. I had an experience, though, that I had to share. Something happened on Friday evening that freaked me out something huge about my Dad and I had a real difficult night and didn't even really sleep. Yesterday was icky feeling, too, and I couldn't put my finger on it. I was working on the computer and got this prickly feeling down my spine. It was so odd and disturbing so I tried to ignore it. Eventually I fell asleep from lack of sleep and when I woke up I had this weird feeling that Dad was here and I actually got up and went looking, in that half asleep, half awake stage. I was calling for him and started crying when I remembered he was gone. THen I went to unlock the front entry so that I could get the paper and saw that his favorite picture had fallen off the wall, the glass didn't even break, and was lying on the brick in the entry way, face up. The picture is a sketch of a man riding a horse, a picture that always reminded Dad of his father. I couldn't believe it hadn't broken, it fell OFF the wall onto the brick tiles!! I picked it up and was holding it, checking to see if any damage was done to the frame and I found an envelope taped to the back and the envelope had my name on it!! Seriously freaked out at this point. I opened the envelope and inside was a short note from my dad, obviously written toward the last of his life because it was pretty shaky, and he wrote using the language he always did when referring to a short letter, a ""missive."" ""Dear Linda, I am sending you this brief missive to tell you that this picture always reminded me of Dad. He wasn't much of a Dad sometimes. One time he got on his old horse and headed down the homestead road and didn't come back for months. He told Mother that he was out looking for ranching jobs. But he came back and then my Mother scolded him about leaving without saying good-bye. I hope I never left you without saying good-bye. Your Mother, such a dear woman, and I were always so busy with the restaurants and I might have left without a good-bye on occasion. I am sorry if I did; that was inexcusable. I will never leave without saying good-bye again. I hope you keep this picture to remember me, at least to remember something I liked. It's not worth any money, not an antique or an original, just something I picked up when it caught my eye. Good-bye, Linda. Love, your Dad."" Then he dated his ""missive"", May 4, 2006. Dad died May 8, 2006. I had really been missing both him and my Mom. I guess somehow the universe knew I needed to feel them again. My unusual feelings like this don't always end up in such a nice way, but I thought this was such a nice thing. So, thank you Mom for keeping Dad sensitive when he was always so busy, and thank you Dad for always remembering to say ""Good-bye.""","Your parents are with you, and still know when you need them. God bless you and Im so glad you had that special encounter


 Dear Linda, That brought tears to my eyes. What a special man your Father was and I am sure you feel he was with you and led you to the note. I have had some of those same feelings from my son who died in 1990 in a car crash. I do believe he is my own angel. Bless you and I am honored to meet you. I am Kitt.


 This is the first post I ahve read in a couple of days I dont mind at all telling you I am in tears Tears of sadness and of joy Yes they know at all times we are missing them mom died in March as well ......dad is not going to be around much longer either THANKS for sharing this very very special ""missive"" with us God Bless You You are certainly an asset to this forum If you need to talk I am always here Luvs LYN"
Grandpa is gagging and throwing up frequently...is this normal?,"My granfather is somewhere in stage 2 of Alzheimer's. Just this past Thursday, he started throwing up. He already has been coughing for some time and sometimes the coughing results in him throwing up. But he's been throwing up an average of 2 a day. He seems fine, no fever, achy muscles...just weak and whinny (since the onset of this disease he is VERY whinny). What concerns me the most is the throwing up. Does anyone know how to stop the coughing/throwing up? Is this the part where I am going to need to start him on baby food? My grandmother who is caring for him (but I live right next door) is old and STUBBORN...she forgets to ask questions when they go to the doctor or can't remember what the doctor said. My mom and I try to make sure we go, but she is getting worse and worse at asking for help! She went to the store to get Kleenex and took Grandpa with her (thank goodness we finally convinced her he should not be driving anymore) and he threw up in the car!! What can be done to make Grandpa stop throwing up/gagging/coughing. I know that swallowing becomes an issue with this disease, but it happened so suddenly!!! Help Please.","Thank you JA! I have been looking online but the surface search has turned up vague info....tonight I'll have more time to dig deeper. You are so right about the effect of throwing up...I see him getting weak and is sleepier than usual. I am sorry about your boyfriends mother!! My grandpa has been accusing people of stealing his stuff/money for about 2 years now. You are so right about the sting of such an accusation . And to try and rationalize with him/them is IMPOSSIBLE. My mom/his daughter is a 3rd grade teacher and we find we try to apply simple learning techniques with him...sometimes it works others, UGH. I will call the doctor tomorrow, but I have little faith in my grandmother's choice of family physician. He did do better today....only had 4 major coughing fits. Regarding the sweets, my grandpa, too, would eat almost continuosly if allowed. When we go to social events, we have to watch him like a kid because he'll walk out with every pocket filled with candies. It's kinda funny to watch him in action. He actually ""sneaks"" the candy into his pocket. Well, thank you again JA for your response. Keep smiling! CaliGal


 Caligal, I'm glad my small amount of input helped.I remembered another thing that DOESN'T work with dealing with my boyfriend's mom.(sometimes we have to work backwards..from what doesn't work to what does!haha)She gets very upset when she is approached with what she perceives as being talked to as a child.I know they may behave as a child at times, but it is a hit to their egos and self respect to be 'talked down 'to.Almost as if they keep just enough of themselves, to be insulted.Tough to find a balance between taking care of them and not insulting them!And as you say, logic doesn't really work, because that part of their brain is terribly affected it seems.Get some support, and try and keep a sense of humor....none of it is funny, but it can be dealt with much easier if it doesn't take it's toll on those around so severely.This site is a great place to vent and has very supportive people ...........I go everywhere from bipoar(son) to allergies....it helps to talk about it! Take care and post often.........


 Sounds like maybe his medications are the culprit,talk to the Dr.ASAP.


 Talking with the Dr needs to be done ASAP!!


 Caligal, Please get some advice from your grandpa's doc soon!The vomiting could be something unrelated, but either way something that is tough on older people...I am seeing some of the effects of Alzheimers on my boyfriend's mother.Her appetite is not good(except for sweets and such), she complains of her throat bothering her, is 'dreamy' (sits and just looks away at times)goes through spells of mixing up names and accusing some of us of stealing(THAT stings, but we must keep in mind they can't help it.)She is still in the beginning stages, as far as they know, though.There is tons of info on Alzheimers online.....maybe you could look and see if vomiting is also a symptom.Hopefully someone who is more knowledgable than me can answer your question...keep posting, and take care.


 Miss caligal...as suggessted I would try to get ahold of his Doc and tell him whats been going on ,,,,and see what he has to say...............My Mom has AD as well and I am her caregiver .she is usually not too bad but can get paranoid and cranky at times lol,she has yet to think (out loud) anyways that someone is stealing from her...and that must really hurt but you must keep in mind they dont realize what they are saying alot of the times.......................Yes there comes a time when pureed food has to be given to them but I would also check that out with the doc......until then be careful of the types of candy he is getting ahold of as he may have problems with that as well .............Welcome and glad to have yous aboard...........great place for info and being able to vent our frustrations at what this DD has done to our loved ones ......will be thinking about you .......please keep us posted .......take care and God Bless


 Welcome Caligal!!! Yes, my Dad has AD also. He is very suspicious of people and keeps a reall short leash on his wallet. He won't even let Mom see in there. He does hand it to me on occassion if we are in the store . . . so I am honored that he trusts me. He has actually 'sneaked' money to me. I just thank him and then spend it on him for golfing or things at the store. Don't know what to add about the vomitting except that, I would suggest you make a list of questions you need answered and symptoms that you have seen in your Dad, as well as an outline any decline. You could then call the doc's office and let them know that you would like to mail it or come in for a consult. I would also inform them that Mom doesn't remember what is being said at the appointments and you would appreciate if they could call you when appointments are made so that you could attend. Doc's office may appreciate this or may not allow it. But, it is worth a try. Keep us posted! Blessings!


 i am trying to find information for a friend of mine who has alzheimers, she is only 58 and she had a PET scan done on her in Dec. they said she had advanced progressive alzheimers.she has not spoken a complete sentence in two years. now only a few names. I have known her for 8 years and she started to get this about 2 years ago. i take her to a neurologist each month and she is on razidyne and she has started to get really agaited and will get her purse and start walking down the street. so now shes on seroquel 50 mgs in the evening, which is helping. now she will get food out of the freezer and try to eat it if someone isn't looking. some foods she eats she throws up. she does it in her bed, in the bathroom sink, or anywhere. i thought she was in the second stage but someone told me it was the third stage. i really don't know that much about it, i'm just helping her out, and learning also. if anyone knows what else i can do i would appreciate it.


 TOTALLY agree Get your friend Back to the doc asap as Snowy said Please do let us know how things go God Bless LYN You are a true friend ......."
Reteted,"I was retested at my request the end of Dec.I've lived with the Diagnoses of Alzheimer's the last 10 yrs.Well,I now have a new diagnoses,VaD.Vasular Dementia.I knew I was doing too well for Alzheimer's after 10 yrs.I still have problems but not as bad (for now)As They could have been.","Doing that ole Happy dance for you Snowy As Rosie asked how different is the tsx and waht is the outcome of all this I am really glad I too thought you a way to smart and with it for the AD dx ya know Keep us posted please Luvs Lyn


 There are many of us getting retested & getting diff.diagnoses not always for the better.......


 Hi you don't know me I am knew to this forum. I just joined today to get into the Lyme forum. I checke the AD forum because I was initially misdiagnosed as having early onset AD. Then docs told me it was vascular dementia. Then it was vasculitis. They thought they knew but they didn't. Now I have been tested (positive) for Lyme disease because I met a nurse with Lyme and she told me Lyme is known for causing vasculitis. She was very confused with Lyme just like me and she isn't very old either. Her dementia is better and she just has some leftover effects now like other neuro stuff. I am just glad I know now so that I can get treated and there is hope I can get better with antibotics.


 Thanks Blue Hope you post more often you are always good for the info lol Miss you here even though its been almost a year I still need ya ya know Luvs Lyn


 The new dx will be slower.It's due to less blood getting to the brain............

Change in Medication,"Hello all..How is everyone doing?..Sorry I haven`t posted recently but have had a zillion things going on...My mothers doctor changed her medication today from Nameda to something called Risperdal M-Tab...I read the little paper that came with it and it sounds like exactly the same thing to me...Has anyone else had any experience with this drug?...Otherwise mom is fairly calm..Gets aggrevated ond disoriented sometimes..Seems to happen more when my brother is around and directing her every move or questioning her about every move....Nephew still doesn`t seem capable of understanding she has a serious medical problem and tells her she ""has to learn to wait"" or ""remember the next time""..Oy",">>>>YOUR nephew needs to be away from her I and others think he is causing more problems than helping <<<< I know..Unfortunately the whole bunch of them are pretty dizzy..But my brother is attempting to keep mom here at home and my nephew is the only one who can stay home all day with her..Otherwise she`d have to be left alone all day and half the night..Oy..I think I may have to look into some sort of public assisted place for her but I don`t know what sort of care one can expect in those places


 Thanks Snowy I knew I was put on it and it wasnt the med for me thats for sure.....I dont know about your mom on this either What do you think Snowy As for looking into places there is a thread on NH as you know and a thread on what to loook for in places you are lloking at ........ All included please check these out LUVS LYN


 How are things going Sara LYN


 I have had this medication and it was for sleeping I am not sure if used for anxiety but I will do a check for you Maybe suggest Aricept or Razadyne Snowy was on both and there is another Namenda I believe YOUR nephew needs to be away from her I and others think he is causing more problems than helping LYN


 Resperidol is a antipsychotic not an antidepressant

 Thanks Snowy for your input How are you and Larry doing?? LYN


 Hello hydranea. I'm glad you found this site & I hope you get the information and support you need. I have worked on a dementia unit and a friends father was diagnosed with Alzheimers. My mother-in-law also has dementia. My first suggestion would be to contact the nearest Alzheimers Society. They are a fantastic source of information and literature. You could talk to them in more detail about your siblings. I'm not sure about where you are but here they have a very helpful information packet for families. Have you talked to your mother about going to a support group? What was her reaction? Perhaps you could attend with her if that would be more comfortable for her.


 Welcome to HW I worked with Ad ppl and had my own retirement home after working in a few NH""s in my career I was caregiver to Mom who passed away one yr ago and now am looking after my dad who also is declining very fast It is a very emotional road to travel and your Mom is a special woman in doing what she does BUT she does need to have some down times as I have posted in Caregivers Needs and Emotional challenges Please do read some of the threads we have up here as well the Resources at the side The Alzheimer's Society is great and I do recommend it for your mom and family members It is hard when other sibllings dont or cannot see the Disease and what it is doing I too face this with mine I cannot stress it enough that they do need to educate themselves on the effects of AD and family members as well as the Loved one involved The 36 Hour A Day Book is one of the best IMO..... There is a site as well called Alzinfo.Org where info is given as well as great newsletters and covers all aspects of this DD This is a great support system right here and IF you can convince your mom or siblings to join they will have unconditional caring support and empathy..... My info is under my name if you would like to email me with any questions comments or concerns I wish you all the best and hope the visit will be all you want it to be I have made many a great memory with Mom even with this DD and continue to make them daily with my dad ...... God Bless Please do stay with us LYN

Dad's Golf Outing,"Well, I spent Monday at Dad's like usual and he is now looking forward to ""doing something"" when I get there. We did the usuall stuff, jig saw puzzle, glueing it together (his favorite part), hanging some of his art on the wall. Well, when mom got home and I went to leave, he put on his jacket and was ready to go with me!! He thought I was taking him golfing! I said, do you WANT to go golfing? He said ""ya, lets go!"". I figured he'd change his mind on the way, but he was determined and excited. We put his clubs in the trunk and went to the golf course. He drove the little golf cart vehicle (wild man) and we had a ball!!! He would hit the ball and never wanted to find it!!! He would just drive his cart to the next spot he liked and send out another ball! It was a riot! he was driving his cart onto the nice grass (I'm not a golfer, can you tell?) and I said ""Dad, I don't think we are alowed to drive on this grass"" and he said ""we can till they stop us!"" Oh my gosh, what a laugh! We had a ball. He started looking for the balls and I would just throw one out as we drove along and he was thrilled that he found it. It was a good day! Lyn . . . are you OK sis? I haven't seen you around. I hope you'll give me an update on your health and the new place you were looking at.","Oh what a wonderful story!!! Good your mom and you had such a good time!! Yes, I do really treasure my time with dad. Other people just don't get it. I will see him tomorrow. We painted wodden horses on Monday and I plan to bring some shining clear coat to spruce them up. He spent a lot of time painting. I was surprised how long he worked at it. His horse is solid purple with green boots and a green rocker on the bottom. They were christmas ornaments I got a couple years ago (2 for a buck). I found them in the basement and new immediately dad would enjoy them. Thanks Lyn . . . I'm so glad you enjoy your mom so much. Makes things all well with the world!! And thanks for the prayers . . . ditto for you! Blessings!

Baths,"My mother has alzheimers. My father takes pretty good care of her except for the fact she needs more baths. I have mentioned this to my dad, but he says he will sit and watch her. I have offered to send someone (CNA) to give her baths because I know my mother is not washing her body. I feel so sad. She was the type of women who took such good care of herself and now its over. I ask her if I could help her take a bubble bath and wash her hair real pretty. She says I took one this morning and even if she does she does not clean properly. Can someone give me some advice? Thank you","I think Snowy is right that sometimes it is a case of just saying somthing like ""right then time for a nice bath mom"" and then just talk her through everything step by step like ""here is your face cloth mom,give your face a wash"" Sometimes you might have to take over and do the actuely washing of her your self but at other times you might find that with some guidance and instructons she might manage to make quite a good job of it all her self. I suppose it is different if a person gets stubbon or agressive when you try to bath them though. In that case I would say that you definatly would need to speak to your Dad about asking for outside help.


 Petey ......Havent seen you back I hope all is well and you have read posts .......God Bless.Lyn


 Petey, Hope things are going better for you. I work in a senior enviornment,and we are always looking for different ways to bathe people. One thing I learned is that they do not have to get in the shower to get clean. There was a lady that could not get her husband to shower. So she got some no rinse soap and used a wash cloth and when he was sleeeping she started with one side of his face. She cleaned him gently and if he stirred she stopped. She would wait until the next night and take up where she left off. Eventually she got him all clean within a few days. She repeated the cleansing process after she was done. It seems like a pain in the butt but it works.Sometimes telling someone they have an odor helps them especially if they were very clean in their younger days. They dont always take it personally if it is one of their loved ones.


 Petey ...Padraig has some great input on bathing for you in Post Padraig ..My story your story .........Hoping things are well for you ....God Bless....Lyn


 Welcome ...With my mom I just told her we were going for outting or someone was coming over and I thought SHE might want to dress up for it or them she usually went for this with no problem . Maybe try suggessting something like this and see where it gets you ..It is hard I know but we have to help sometimes,and you just try to do what you can .Sounds like the mother in law lives with you and hubby ? I hope you post more and if you need to talk my email is ther please feel free to contact me.........God Bless....Lyn


 How is all else doing any one having any luck with the grooming as we can do a thread on this alone if needed actually if I get time in am I think I will start one LYN


 IF you cannot get them to shower or tub a nice hot bowl of soapy water will still do the trick Use two washclothes one for body and facee ( face first) and other for Pericare Make sure it is dry down in perinerrial area and use a nice soothing lotion for skin to keep it moistened Always check for bruises and open cuts as well....diffence in texture of skin ect. Try to use toilet paer or kleenex for inner ear Q tips not good as you can cause damage w/o knowing from what my doc has told me ......


 If you can get them involved as much as possible keeps them busy as well as kinda in the space that they are doing for themselves hand them a washcloth and just say while I do this .....how be you do that or something along those lines you use whatever works for you


 If your loved one likes to swim perhaps take them to the YMCA or YWCA...... Great exercise and good for them ...... Doesnt take the place of proper bathing and grooming though Just a thought I know my Dad loves swimming LYN


 Does she have a shower? Sometimes getting in with the person in your shorts & a T shirt works.Or don't ask,just do it.


 I have to agree here you have to sometimes just do things and I know you are hesitant cuz it MOM but you will notice she now depends on you and Dad for her life choices and decisions .this is the saddest part of this DD it robs you of your self.Give her a little laughter in the tubby .....I will tell you I was never so embarrassed in my life when I had to prep my own Mother for surgury ...We did make a few ""Jokes "" about it but I can honestly say I have Memories with Mom that my siblings dont have......I am glad you found us here and hope you will post often there is a great group of peeps on this board ......Hopefully we can help you out .we are here for support ,ideas and to get a break as well ........A real nice warm bubble bath would do the world of good and as Snowy said jump in ....I found that when I was to pushy with Mom she would get nasty so I just went with her mood for the day ...Hope we have helped in some way .Take care and God Bless......Lyn

 Hi and thanks for your input ........Hope you post again ......God Bless......Lyn


 I have noticed my mother-in-laws lack of grooming alot lately. Fortunately I don't have a strong sense of smell but my husband and sister in law have told me that she does have an odor. Also, she seems to wear the same clothes every day. I do the laundry and am willing to wash her clothing but apparently she feels that is a burden and washes her clothes by hand in the bathroom sink. I am horrified and want to help but how can I make her shower and have me wash her clothes?


 Petey Wondering how you are making out Not seen you for quite some time here Hoping all is well LYN


 Sometimes we have to remember they may not like Showers ya know Baths was in their childhood and yrs and so if you are fighting about showering Take a care and sit it in tub filling the tub up and washing her/ him then let water out and use a soft hand held showerer that you can spary to do the rest of body and hair PERICARE in both men and woman is a MUST.....many meds will cause Yeast infections and so on Good LUCK


 Doing the care on loved ones is imperative whether we do it by shower tub or big old bowl please do make sure thay are groomed and looked at for bruising and skin changes anything out of ordinary should be handled by the doc LYN


 I dont think that washing out her undergarments in the sink is that bad and she probably wants to do it so just go with it It certainly cannot hurt IMHO LYN"

back from vacation,"Hello everyone just a quick update I posted last week about my fathre, daignosed with AD. Mom haveing a hard time and we all went on vacation together last week. We all stayed in the same house. All 14 of of. It was not as stressfull as I thought. Although my dad was way out of sorts. Noiced that he is starting yo shuffle. My brothers, kids Husband, sisters in law, and brothers girlfriend were defenelty aware of my dad not being mentally with us. But we all took care of him, (we only lost him one time as he wondered out in front of the house, while nobody watched.) , and played ball, frisby, and yes I even got to dance with him in the sunset. He loves to dance. We even got a little silly dancing a fast sound on the sand. As you know AD patients do tend to act like children. I feel like I have already grieved the dad i knew and know must enjoy the man he is now, no matter difficult that is now. I enjoyed is company more that ever. I tried very hard to ignore the time thta he got angry with someone over something so tiny. Probably knowing that it would not be long till he no longer knows who I am and we will no longer be able to dance made the hard times more tollerable.. My siblings are not as open with their feeling about this. I do hope that they will be able to come to terms with it soon. It sound selfish but I can not worry about that. I need to make sure my mom is ok. My parents will continue on vacation staying with one of my siblings. I hope to get her to seek out a support group for caregviers. Any ideas on how to convice her? She really wants to take care of him forever, I know that whe will not beable to as he moves to the next stages of AD. He seems to be progessing so quickly. SHe now shaves, him and help him get dressed. He als need to be reminded to eat. I know that each stage has no time frame. I gave her the 36 hour day as she has read it, so that is a good start. Thanks for your support.","Lyn, Thank you for the post. I will suggest that she go to a support group to learn how to take care of him. It is hard for her, expecially since they are bothe so young. She is 65 and he is only 71. He was only diagnosed 2 year ago but seems to geing going so quickley. Yes those will be great memories that I will add to the rest of them. Thank you for pointing that out to me. Do you have help with your mother? Again thank you for taking the time to answer my post, IT is so nice knowing that we are not alone. Hydrangea


 Welcome back What a beautiful visual I have seeing you and your dad dancing together I did the same I made memories while Mom was going further into the disease I truly believe it helped me and her by doing this Your siblings are losing out on preciuos time as our mine Thery have to accept that it is fact and soon he will not know anyone ..that hurts yes it is all part of the DD Your mom wants to care for him from now on so i would tell her she will need to go to a spousal support group and learn some support and techniques ....share hers with others as well tell this will help her and those in the group if she will go Please do keep me posted and glad you made some beautiful memories and had a great time as well LYN


 My mom passed away ayear ago March hun but I look after my dad and I havd respite care for him or I take him to market and to yard sales he just loves those and he also loves the casino but often forgets what he is playing and so gets frustrated lol Such is the ""Life"" But you know hun I would never trade it I live love and laugh my way thru and dad helps me with the lil twinkle in his eye I will be saddened when that goes as it will he too is going fast I think more from a broken heart ya know Be well and look into something like that explain that SHE could help out people NEW to this with some of her suggesstions and I guarentee she will enjoy feeling she is helping and I dont doubt she will help out new ppl with loved ones that are at aloss right now ya know Keep in touch hun Try to have a good Easter if you celebrate it Be safe God BLess"
"Medical, Legal and General Dementia Advice Needed","I need some major assistance. I will try to be brief, but there are some incredible dynamics at play. My mother has removed my grandmother, who is showing signs of dementia, from the very comfortable assisted living residence that she was at to a non-profit, hole in the wall nursing home facility. I'm sure it could be worse, but this place is pretty bad. My grandmother has stopped eating because she is still very much aware of her surroundings, very depressed, has nothing to do (no TV, 1 or 2 visitors once or twice a week, not allowed to leave the floor even with supervision, etc.), and in her own words ""the food sucks."" My mother has made it clear that she has executorship and Grandma ""will not be moved from the current facility."" I am a 32 year-old professional, engaged, with no children. I have had some dealings with Alzheimer and dementia patients, but honestly nothing more than a few hours of visits here and there. I am pretty bright and believe that I understand the task involved and the 24-7 needs of memory care patients. I completely understand the enormous task that I am asking to undertake, and my fiancé is 100% behind me. My fiancé and I would like to bring my grandmother to live with us. I spoke with the head nurse at the current facility and she said that, other than the slight dementia and sometimes getting agitated at night, there is no reason she could not be in a home environment. Medically, she is doing very well for an 85-year old. Sometimes she loses her balance, but we have her use a walker, wheelchair or assistance at all times as to not take any chances. Our plan is that my fiancé will work part-time and we will hire a full-time nurse to be with her for four weekdays and Saturday (we have a business that is busiest on Saturdays). Here are the issues: - The assisted living place that she was at before is out of the question for numerous reasons. - If I take her out, will I be able to find someplace if she later medically needs to be in a nursing home? - They are in Virginia, we are in Tennessee. Given the multi-state situation, what do I need to know if this becomes a legal fight? - Is taking her out of this facility, which is depressing but giving her the ""best"" medical treatment (which is very questionable given what I've seen), better? My house won't be depressing at all, but I may not be able to provide the best medical provisions (at least, that's what I fear). For those who have been a similar situation (either legal battle or bringing a loved one needing memory care into a home environment), any advice, information, words of wisdom, thoughts.... ANYTHING... would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so, so very much for reading all of this and any advice you might be able to extend.","Bev, Thank you so much for your response. Here are a few replies to your questions: ""what she does, should be overseen by a court"" -- There is no court supervision or appointee overseeing my parent's actions or spending because this has been very straight-forward up to this point. ""First you should talk to your mother and get permission to be the custodial guardian"" -- Hell will freeze over first before she will willingly give me executorship, guardian rights, etc. ""If she refuses, you can write a letter to the court"" -- I'm going to try a few other things first, but if it has to come down to getting the courts involved then so be it. ""All of the above takes a slight shift if your grandmother gave her power of attorney--depending on what type of power of attorney"" -- Yes, my grandmother gave her power of attorney, executorship and all that jazz. ""ask yourself is this worth a potential rift"" -- I am through with my parents. There's a lot of water under the bridge and this is basically the last straw. My mother told me last night that ""it's all downhill from here. We need to count our losses and move on with our lives."" I look at this a little differently, I guess. I believe that my grandmother could easily have a good, happy life for the next ten years in the right environment. In the place she's in now, she will last maybe a year or two, and it will be very psychologically painful. She's already started starving herself and she's only been there for 2 weeks. So, is this worth a rift in the family? You betcha. ""Is there some other way?"" -- I am trying to find an alternative nursing home in Virginia that might make everyone happy. ""Are you close enough to visit a lot?"" -- I am eight hours away. I can visit once or twice a month. ""Could you hire a young person to go where she is and visit with her each day?"" -- I would love to try this, but I have no way of making sure the person shows up and actually spends time with her. I could call her and ask, but she is not allowed to have a telephone. Has anyone else had luck with having a ""sitter"" come be with the person? ""Can you do something about the surroundings--bring things to make it more homey and pleasant?"" -- She has some pictures up on a corkboard, but that's it. They do not allow many personal belongings. The personal belongings that she does have has been disappearing (mostly clothes).

 My, my. You got some good assistance from the social worker while I was writing and great help was offered by others. This website is amazing. bev


 Photogenic........I am praying that the Social Worker has been of assisstance to you with your Grandma> I worked in Homes for the Aged,Retirement homes and Nursing Homes .........there are good in all ...........I am also including the staff in on this ,...too often our loved ones are left for others to look after,much thought,close scrutiny about accrediation ect has to be done prior to just putting them away.I do not envy your position right now and I wish that I could wave a majical wand and have it all disappear but we both know that is not the case.Snowy has a great Q' and that is why was she taken out of Al in the first place? Please keep us posted on how things are going for you .......................God Bless ............Lyn..............I am in Canada so the Laws and Rules are not the same here...........sorry I am not able to be of more help to you in this time ..............Lyn


 Many, MANY thanks to everyone for your thoughtful advice, prayers and assistance. I have more good news to share. The social worker has convinced my parents into moving Grandma to the assisted living facility for dementia patients. (I have to remember to give the social worker a BIG HUG the next time I visit. Words cannot express my appreciation that someone out there cares and stood up for her, especially since I feel like my hands are tied on the matter.) So she will be out of the current situation and into a ""home-style"" environment by next week. Words cannot express the joy, you guys! My parents are saying that her money will only allow her to live in this A.L. apartment for 2-1/2 years and that we can discuss what will happen at that point. As far as I'm concerned, the Alzheimer's unit that they had her in is not an option. So, I'm trying to soak in the good news, but I'm still fearful of the future. I would continue to pursue court action, but I don't think I have a leg to stand on as long as she's in a decent environment. So, I guess I should just wait and see, right?


 Onermedicating is a big problem in this country,& the elderly are the worst to suffer for it.We just have to be more diligent in seeing that doesn't happen................


 Photogenic.......I am so glad the Social Worker was able to do what you asked her to do ..........Just a thought but how about a real nice card she can display on her desk for others to see form you thanking her for helping you and your Grandma so much.........Keep us posted .........God Bless ..........Lyn

 Wishing all a Happy Easter if you do Easter......... Take care and be safe LYN


 My sister kept my mother (alzhiemers) and father (parkinsons) at home. She had a nurse come in before she brought them to her house and set up a hospital type room, with all the equipment necessary to care for them. She also had ramps put in. They gave her power of attorney, so the first thing they did after that was use their money to buy a wheel chair lift van. My sister and her husband have a small business, and both needed to work. They hired an older lady to stay with them during the day--again using mom and dad's money. The only real relief they got from caring for them over an 8 year period was when one brother showed up a couple times a year, so my sister and her husband could get away. Everyone else who came were burdens. My sister and her husband were chastised by family members and friends, who didn't like the level of care she gave, but mom and dad were satisfied. When my mother died, one sister who hadn't shown up during the 4 years my mother was alive and in our sisters care, yelled foul. She claimed that my sister hadn't put mom in the hospital at the end, because she was busy starving mom to death. The rest of us knew better. Nevertheless, it's caused a lot of hurt and hard feelings. I have a sister-in-law who had a stroke several years ago. She requires tube feeding and round the clock care. When she first came home, the whole family split about who was to be in charge, and while it was eventually settled, the fighting cost her a good part of her chance to get better and left a rift. Estimates of her care in a convalescent center were a quarter million a year, because of the tube feeding. The family decided to keep her at home, where she wanted to be. According to court documents her round the clock care costs a little over $100,000 and none of that is to a health care professional. Other costs, for special food, medicine, doctors visits, etc bump that even higher. She is about out of money. The house will be going on the market soon and she will be placed in state facility. One of her caregivers is her neice (40 years). The person who was in charge at the beginning left her doing 16 hour days. I walked into the house and heard her yelling and angry. When I got to the door of the room they were in she was just about to hit the patient. I sat down with the neice and explained that it wasn't her fault that the older, supposedly wiser family members should not have left that idiot in charge, and they should not have left it all up to her. She told them she needed help; I backed her up. No one ever was told that she lost her temper. The neice has been the best caregiver of a very large bunch since then. I'm not trying to tell you the worst to change your mind. I truly admire my sister and the neice. They are examples of people at their best, doing things that would be too hard for most of us. You are talking about legal and other fights--believe me they come built into this sort of situation. Legal: I'm not sure what your mother is saying by executorship. I think in most states it would be guardianship. Anyway what she does, should be overseen by a court--with annual accounting for funds. First you should talk to your mother and get permission to be the custodial guardian (your state may have a different name for it). Your mother would retain control of funds. If she refuses, you can write a letter to the court, stating (with the help of an attorney from the state of your grandmother's residence) that you want custodial guardianship and why. The court will then be required to have a hearing on that issue. You will have to prove that you have done your homework and are capable of handling it. It's not the time to be faint of heart. All of the above takes a slight shift if your grandmother gave her power of attorney--depending on what type of power of attorney. If your mother hasn't got guardianship, you probably could file for it. You need an attorney to tell you about crossing state lines--in fact I'd go to 3 to make sure I was getting good advice. It could effect your ability to place her in a home later, if you need to. While you obviously are a loving person, ask yourself is this worth a potential rift, that may never heal, between you and your mother. A wise friend use to tell me, the smallest change is the best change. Is there some other way? Are you close enough to visit a lot? Could you hire a young person to go where she is and visit with her each day? Can you do something about the surroundings--bring things to make it more homey and pleasant? I felt like you do, when my mother and aunt put my grandmother in a home. Gram was always a little crazy (for real). So she was much younger than your grandmother. She lived to 103 and spent one third of her life in that care center. Today, I'm darn glad I didn't insist on bringing her to live with me. I'm also very sorry that I lived to far to do anything for her. bev


 Just spoke with the social worker and she says that she's going to try to persuade my parents to put Grandma into an assisted living facility that's specifically tailored to dementia patients. She said that the nurses and her could not understand why my parents were trying to put her in the Alzheimer's unit at this point. She said that it is completely unnecessary given her abilities, mental health and overall stability. Anyway, hopefully the social worker will be able to change the situation. Keep your fingers crossed! :)


 1. Supervision and letter: Since the court isn't involved a lettr won't do the trick. You would have to go to court for a guardianship hearing. This is similar to my sister-in-law. No one had power of attorney, so the family fought over who was making good and bad decisions. We eventually settled on who should be guardian and we had two people, working together--jointly doing guardianship of her body and assets. Overall, that did work out, but not for the first year and a half. By the time all the dust was settled, my s-i-l had missed her window of opportunity to improve. Contact an attorney in the state where your grandmother lives NOW. You don't have to take action, but you need answers. Have all your questions ready. Ask about guardianship of the body and assets, crossing state lines, and how jurisdiction will work. Also ask what the court will want from you in the way of financial reporting requirements. 2. Hell freezing over: If your grandmother has extensive assets, that may motivate your mother. However, whether or not gram does, you mother might be trying to protect you from your youth and exhuberance. I would never say to my daughter, ""we need to count our losses and move on with our lives,"" but I also would not want to see my daughter doing what you want to do--not for me or anyone. 3. The rift: You may have noticed that I did not say anything about visiting my parents when they were ill. The rift between my mother and me was so great that I didn't want to see her, and I didn't go to her funeral. By the time she died, my father was in very bad shape. I talked to him just once, and then went to his funeral. My family was through with me. I have been through worse than that and I'm old. Their feeling don't matter enough for me to wish I'd changed anything I did. Now my family is messing with my adult kids, trying to show them how ""family"" acts. So now my kids ask me why I was so heartless. 4. Alternative nursing home: Even if you do find a better nursing home, you have to consider that her reaction is in part missing the support group she had around her--the familar faces, the common experiences, her friends. A different home may or may not do the trick. 5. The home: The place where my grandmother stayed was like what you are describing, including the possessions getting stolen and no phone. Obviously they did something right since gram lived to 103. 6. Sitter: I have no personal experience or knowledge of this. I don't know how it would work out or if the home would allow it, but there are good people who care. Ask the home first. If they allow it, ask that friendly nurse, if she knows someone. There are also hospice volunteers, look them up. They are intended to work with the dying, but if you explain your fears, they may send someone to help her adapt and get her through this adjustment--or keep her going until you get things settled. They can also tell you if paid care services are available in the area. If you grew up in the area, look among your family and friends to see if they will look in on her. If you can't get one good one, get many. Have them keep her active and get her interacting with others, walk with her down halls to meet people. It sounds like a crisis--take action. Always, keep in mind, ""the smallest change is the best change."" It is a valuable concept. And if you have to do a big change, then you have a track record of providing comfort and care. bev


 Photogenic,why wasyour Grandma taken out of AL in the first place?


 This particular thread caught my eye and I hope that you all don't mind me joining in briefly...I must offer my complete admiration to you and your fiance for considering this move for your Grandma! My Grandma was diagnosed with AD in her late 70's. Both of her children my Mom and her brother, took turns having her live with them. There came a time, however, when the stress and strain of caring for someone that you love, yet could not be left alone at all took a bit of a toll and my family found a wonderful Retirement Home that catered to her in the beginning with her own room, and a 24 hr. nursing staff. Then she was moved into their skilled care facility when the time came that she no longer knew where she was or who the relatives were visiting her - the nursing staff was wonderful. My Mom washed her clothes for her even then and kept a close eye on her personal belongings. She was still very well cared for...though the surroundings had changed considerably, with the new environment. I know you still must make your own decision, personally, but I wanted to add a little here for you to know, that you are not alone!! Hugs, Teri


 SnowyLynne: To answer your question: The original facility that my grandmother was in has an assisted living unit, with very minimal nursing care, and then a full-blown, non-ambulatory Alzheimer's unit. Apparently, if you're somewhere in between, then they don't have any way to accommodate you, which I think is odd. Anyway, Grandma was acting abnormally -- hallucinations, slurring, night wandering, paranoia, etc. -- which all came on rather suddenly. They (the facility and my parents) chaulked it up to Alzheimer's or severe dementia and required her to move. The real reasons for the abnormal actions were that she was being given WAY too medicine (about 19 or 20 different prescript ions) and she had a urinary tract infection that was out of control, but no one could seem to diagnose it. Now, she has had two strokes and suffers some issues due to this and probably some dementia (occasional aphasia, trouble writing, some balance issues, and no peripheral vision out of her left eye), but she does not have full-blown Alzheimer's. My mother was trying to claim that the Alzheimer's came on ""all of a sudden,"" which anyone who knows anything knows this is impossible. With a reduction of medicine and the urinary tract infection cured, she's pretty close to being her normal self. However, going back to the original assisted living facility is still not an option. She is beyond their capabilities, but that simply means she needs a little more nursing care. Post Edited (PhotoJenic) : 10/4/2005 5:15:05 PM (GMT-6)

 Overstimulation can cause Sundowning,esp.in the afternoon.A nap after lunch is a good idea,an hour or two.Being too tired can keep them from sleeping.


 bump

 Howlyncat, I am sorry to bother you but I am confused to the Bump messages. Am I supposed to see something? I don't see any link to anything. Please help...


 Got it! Boy am I a dork!!! My step-father is very confused, of course. He forgets to do everything, from showering the changing his clothes. Even though he is in a nursing home (which is one of the very best ones in NE Tenn) they don't seem to make the patients take care of their personal grooming. Now, I know they only take showers 3 times a week, but couldn't they at least make him change his clothes and underwear? I guess not. They have more important things to do I am sure. He calls either me or my mother every night to say ""You have to come get me tomorrow. I am ready to go home"". Do they ever stop wanting to go home? Do they ever consider the nursing home as their new home? This is all just so strange to me. I have never been in a nursing home in my life and now I go to one every day. And, to make it all the worse, I have so much resentment built up for this man and yet I have to be sweet and loving. At least he can't tell that I am faking it. Half the time he forgets that I was even there. As for his daughters, they want nothing to do with him. He has ignored them for the past 20 years, including their children (his grandchildren) so I guess they figure...well, he was never there for us so why should we be there for him...I am sure that is what they think. I would probably do the same. Well, maybe not. As for them helping my mother, that will never happen. They basically said...well, you married him so you are stuck with him! You should have divorced him when you had the chance!...Of course, that is what we all think, it's hard not to, including my mom thinking that! So, in the end, we will care for him and visit him for as long as he is here with us. He has always put himself first, even before God, so maybe this is God's way of saying...you are not number 1!...I don't know. It's just so very strange how this has all worked out. We meet with the Medicaid person on the 28th. I pray that goes well! Thanks for caring. You are so very sweet!!! God bless you...sonia


 How are you doing Sonia Long time no see Worried bout ya LYN


 That's it.


 Thank you. I still do not understand what causes sundowning. Can anyone explain why it happens?


 Thanks Snowy Lyn


 Hi Sonia. I'm sorry that your stepfather is experiencing Sundowners now. I have befriended a lady in a local nursing home, and about one month ago, she also began experiencing symptoms of Sundowners Syndrome. Much like your stepfather, she started becoming extremely agitated when it became dark, and during the middle of the night, she also believed that people were entering her room and stealing her things. I did some research after my friend developed Sundowners because I also wanted to know why she was having so many problems at night. For the most part, it is not yet clearly known why Alzheimer's patients have increased problems at night. Recent research has speculated that the damaged nerve pathways in Alzheimer's patients disrupts the part of the brain which control circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms control the sleep - wake cycles in our brains. So, as a result, the internal clocks in the Alzheimer's patients are very messed up. People without Alzheimer's are tired and sleepy at night, but the reverse seems to happen to the Alzheimer's patient. That feeling of sleepiness is replaced with feelings of extreme agitation. Also, because Alzheimer's patients tire easily, they often become more agitated at night, when they are most tired. After my friend in the nursing home developed Sundowners, the doctor suggested that she take more naps during the day, in an effort to curb her increased agitation at night. In addition, it is believed that Sundowners is exaggerated by a lack of sensory stimulation at night. During the day, the activity and noises can sometimes provide a secure feeling to the Alzheimer's patient. In the nursing home that I visit, almost all of the Alzheimer's patients sleep well during the day, possibly because they feel more secure when there is activity around them. During the night, however, it is usually very quiet and dark, and that can lead to increased restlessness in some patients. My friend in the nursing home also is very scared that she will be left alone. This feeling has only been intensified now that she has developed Sundowner's. It seems like she doesn't understand what's happening to her, and that is leading to even more problems of agitation. I hope that your stepfather is able to find some peace soon. I'll be thinking of both of you, and take care.


 Thank you luvdog and to everyone else who replied to my post. My step-father has been in the nursing home for over a week now. Some nights he seems okay while other nights he is totally confused. It is so hard to decide if we should keep him there because he has so many lucid moments. The reason he was placed there in the first place is because he fell 3 times over the weekend and got a concussion. After having him taken to the ER in an ambulance, the doctors decided it would be better to keep him in a home because he was so dizzy and could not walk very well. To this day, he says he is still dizzy but seems to be walking fine. The problem is that my mother is 66 and they live in a split level house with 3 dogs (I live 2 streets away). We are scared he will fall down the stairs or something like that. They have had seperate bedrooms for many, many years now and my mother is scared he will start wandering off during the night. His short term memory is gone and gets confused very easily. One day he took a butcher knife to his room and was trying to cut his toenails with it when my mother caught him. They have not had a good marriage over the past 18 years, he cheated on her numerous times, spent all of their money, never saved a dime for retirement and neglected to get any type of insurance after he was forced to retire because of the Alz. He was a control freak so my mother never knew any of this until it was to late. Now she is stuck having to care for a man she no longer loves but feels guilty about leaving him in the nursing home. It is a terrible situation and only seems to be getting worse as the days progress. Right now, Medicare is paying for the home but in another week they will stop. We are trying to see if they qualify for Medicaid but are concerned about the monthly allowance they will leave my mother with. Things just seem to be getting worse and worse. His daughters will have nothing to do with him and will not help in any way (because of the way he has treated them their entire lives).


 Bump


 It just means that I am ""Bumping "" the thread back up for ppl to see thats all Sorry about that How are you doing Lyn


 Sonia I bumped up a thread called ""Nursing Homes.....Check it out "" and if you look in there you will find the NH he is in .......... It rates the homes and quality of care from staff how the residents are treated ect.,,,,,I was in total shock when I saw these reports . NO hun they wont ever stop saying they want to go home , they will continually want that or if not that then something else .My mom was like that at the end ( she passed away 9 mths ago) but I had her at her house and looked after her ( I am retired geriatric nurse) I now am looking after my dad ( step) but he was GOOD and always was great with us kids when he came into my life at 8 yrs old as well he loved mom dearly and was not mentally nor physically abusive . How is your mom holding up thru all this hum it has to be hard,why can the children he had forget what happened yrs ago and HELP her out now I truly believe God see's it all and acts accordingly ya know I am proud of you for going there each day even though he has hurt you and there is resentment there .......still you go ....... I really would check out the NH he is in something ios not sitting too well within me about the care he is NOT getting .....yes clothes especially under garments need and should be changed daily ...Please read the thread about the homes and find the one he is in you might just be suprised and even as shocked as I was Hoping you post often and if you need to talk my info is under my name feel free to add me to yahoo or MSN I would enjoy talking with you You are a special person as is your mom God Bless and keep you both in His arms Luvs Lyn


 My HS internet server is down on dial up and it is so slowwwwwww To the top for newbies"
Trying to do what's right,"Hello. This is only my 3rd post since we found out my mom has AD. My two brothers are convinced she belongs in assisted living. She's not ready to move and I've been supporting her on this all week - even through all the emotional abuse heaped on me by my brothers. My one brother told me I was ""weak as usual"" and hung up on me. I then went over to mom's to fill her pill box and visit and she tells me that she's now convinced she should move. I felt so betrayed after everything she put me through this past week. I know I should only be concerned about what is best for her, but I really thought I was doing that. She is still capable of living on her own and now she's moving 20 minutes away and creating additional stress for me because I'm the one who visits her the most and does the most with her. I know my brothers won't increase their visits and now she'll be farther away from me and calling me and crying that she doesn't want to be there. Somebody please help me. I can't stop crying over this and feel so lonely and alone. My husband is very supportive but now I feel like I've lost my mother and she's still alive. Thank you for listening.","I have thought about this quite alot since reading yesterday ....... Personally I think you are having way too much responsibility especially when you have other siblings I went thru this with mom til she passed a yr ago and am going thru it with my (step) dad as well Dont get me wrong I value and cherish so many wonderful memories my siblings missed out on BUT sometimes I was very ill with crohns and had IV's in and still had to do it all .....they were only there for what they thought they could get money wise and with the Royal Doulten collection as well as expensive antique furniture I kept Mom at home ( hers) as I only lived a few steps away ( can see the house from here) and I went there numerous times daily attending to her need and now do for Dad as well ....... Never did I have help and I had to retire as an RN due to health reasons so I was basically the ""ONE"" to do it all It wore me down in all honesty and I still get that way with dad... He will not be happy unless he is in his home where he still has a connection with Mom even with this D Disease I can feel your pain and anguish thru yopur post If your brothers feel you are being ""weak"" have them come and do all of what you do for her on a daily basis and if it is possible to have her at home I would suggest you do but also get someone else ( caretaker.....Homecare) to come in and give you some ""down time"" I know our Gov in Canada pays for this not sure about other countries though I am sure you could check into this I dont think your mom wants to go I think she may feel she is a burden to your siblings and that is so unfair for her and you to deal with Please if you need to talk email me my info is under name at side I would be more than happy to talk with you and help as much as possible Be well and have no guilt hun you are not in the wrong here at all IMHO LYN


 Thanks for your input..... Welcome to Healing Well Hope to see you post often LYN


 Who has POA?Power of Attorny?


 I am so sorry for what you are going thru Your mom will do that hun she feels lonely I am sure I suggest you read some of the other threads and it might help Also please email me its under my name at side LYN


 If I've got this right, you have: Degenerative Disc Disease, Spinal Stenosis, Herniated Disc, Arthritis of the Spine, some kind of problem with the L5-S1 area, sciatica, diabetes, depression and anxiety. And you are your mother's main caretaker? Sounds to me your mother, and you, would be better off if she were in assisted care. Sure, she'll be 20 minutes away, but during your visits you can enjoy each other, you won't be doing all the work. There will be an adjustment period, and yes, she may ask to go home periodically, but if you and the caretakers remind her often enough that this is her new home, she will adjust. My father has been in assisted care for two years, 500 miles from me (near his wife). He was there a year before he said one day, ""I've visited here long enough and am ready to go home now."" When told this was his home now & he'd been there a year, he was astonished, but understood. We are now in the process of moving him to my town, to a care home that will be 20 minutes away. Seems like next door compared to 500 miles away, where I have been flying down to visit regularly. His wife is getting frail herself and here my dad will have me & my three grown kids to visit & take him out, and his wife will come for visits periodically. We expect an adjustment period, but am sure it will work out fine. If you are crying all the time, perhaps you need an adjustment to your depression/anxiety medications. You have done just great caring for your mom - now is time for the next step - which won't be any easier if you put it off more months or years. And my guess is you will be pleasantly surprised, if you get a quality care home, your mom will do very well, and you will be less stressed & happier.


 I've decided to become ""Switzerland"" in the matter of mom moving to assisted living. The past two nights my youngest brother has heaped so much emotional abuse on me for something I believe is right for my mom. My grandparents lived in their home until they died at the ages of 88 and 86 - mom respected their wishes and did what she could to care for them as well as getting some day help to come in. Her brother lived two hours away and only came to see his parents once a month or six weeks and when he and his wife were there they spent their time socialing with friends that still lived in the area. I had a wonderful role model for caring for your parents and I wanted to be their for my mom as she was for her parents. My dad passed away in 1977. I still believe it's ok for mom to live at home. My brother is signing the papers tomorrow and then they'll move her in the next two weeks. As of today my mom doesn't remember that she told them she'd move. All he!! is going to break up when they show up with the truck. I've decided to just love my mom and spend quality time with her. My brother can just go on his merry way like he has been doing - only calling and seeing mom every six weeks or two months. All my life I've been picking up pieces for some one or another and this will be no different. Thanks to both of you for your input. It helps talking to others who have suffered through the same mess. Melanie


 Melanie I am so sorry this has come to what it has I really do give you so much credit for doing all you have for your Mom I was the same with mine and now dad Like you said let them do as they will and yo will still be the main person she see's and makes memeories maybe remind her constantly it was NOTY you decision I am assuming your brother(s) have POA.....Please do let us know Take care and stay with us here we can always be your support system ......

Need Advise Please,"I see lots of symptoms of AD in your post. When my mother-in-law is really bad I try (and sometimes I fail) to remember that these are symptoms of a disease that mostly can not be helped. I have wanted to start a thread about symptoms (and when they start, and how long someone has had them) because the lists you find are not comprhensive enough, because people are so varied. Her nasty temperment is a personality change. I have read and heard that the mean become sweet and the sweet become mean. I don't find this to be true in my mother-in-laws case. In her case the mean became meaner, but she will have a sweet day once in a great while. Not taking her pills is a symptom. It goes along with ""every one is trying to poisen me"" You can take her pills to her twice a day and hope that your attention to her will be motivation to take them. But you can not force her, she is a human and has a right to her decisions, at least to a point. My mother-in-law hates her pills because there are side effects; the first ones made her throw up. The next ones give her diarreah. She hasn't quite figured out that the pill she takes at night, gives her the terrible morning diarreah. But when she does we will be off in search of a new pill. Your Mom is not lazy (unless she has always been so) another symptom of AD is an inability to clean your house. I think partly it comes from being scattered and confused mentaly, partly from depression, partly from an 85 year old body that is tired and has arthritis. Getting someone in to do the housework was the best solution. I have read that people with AD become afraid of water. I don't think this is always true. But I think the fear of slipping in the shower when you are alone in the house is probably a great concern. Also I think they get to a point where it is just too much trouble to shower. You can try saying ""Today is Monday, you always take a shower on Monday. I don't want you to forget."" Not much of what I said probably helps, but I really liked reading your letter because I don't feel so alone in my own frustration. When is it time to put people with a serious disease in a hospital? I asked this myself in a post only a week ago. I think I have found my answer.- Probably when you can no longer care for them yourself. Only you can decide when that is.................Inert","Thank you inert and howlyncat for you input, I do appreciate it. I too have 3 other siblings. We live a state apart. My older sister visits mom twice per year for a week at a time, the youngest sister visits once a year for less than 18 hours and my brother has no contact with mom. I moved my mother to my state 6 years ago after my father passed away because none of my siblings would find the time to help mom. She never drove, never learned how to pay a bill, write a check, etc. Mom was from the ""old school"" where the husband took care of everything. My husband and I owned two businesses at the time and I had to tell mom that if she wanted me to continue to help her, that she'd have to move where I lived because I couldn't keep our businesses going when I would have to be away for months at a time at her home doing everything for her. We built her a house on our property to live the rest of her life in. Now this was a very healthy woman of 80 who mowed 2 1/2 acres of grass per week, didn't believe in a dryer and hung her clothes to dry in the attic which she had to go up and down stairs to do this. She chopped her own hedges, cleaned her own house, etc. WHEN she found out that dad left her ""well off"" is when she became lazy. She stopped doing everything...said, ""why should I, I've done it all my life, I've got money and can pay to get things done."" During her annual check up here, the Doctor said she is such a healthy person for her age. No osteoperosis, no hardening of the arteries, lungs of a young child, all her blood work is 100%. She has no arthritus except in 2 fingers. She can run like the wind...motives quite well. Bought herself an energetic Jack Russell dog for companionship. Then the beginning of this year, she started telling me that she saw bushes turn into bears, cars driving through a forrest where there isn't any road, and telling me she's seeing my deceased father standing in my yard during the day while I was at work. That's when I took her in for evaluation. Dr. says she's showing early signs of AD and perscribed Namenda which works wonderfully. But, we needed to get her back into some type of normal routine which meant helping herself to an extent he said. She refuses to do anything. Says ""money"" can buy anything. I do notice a huge difference in her without the meds in her system. She had no side affects from them. She is now back her nasty manipulative attitude which I cannot cope with. She has no hobbies whatsoever. Won't even read a book or newspaper. She will not get involved with a Senior center...says those places are for old people and she doesn't fit in. She calls my friends conning them into taking her places without my knowledge, which I put a stop to. I worry about the liability and responsibility part of them taking her anywhere. Frustrating? Yes...it sure is. I spoke with my older sister this morning and now I have second thoughts about her intervention. You see, she's in bad healthy, a diebetic too, a person who admits to me that she too doesn't take her own meds when she's suppose to. She says she's kind of like mom. I don't know where this will all go after mom's Dr appt on Tuesday. I'm trying to keep positive and things will improve. Dr and I talked about an assited living facility six months ago if mom didn't try to do more for herself. Thanks for letting me come here and vent in my posts. I've looked around this forum and there is such wonderful support and advise here. I will be checking out your resource links!


 Thanks again Howlyncat for your input and support! (((Hugs))) Again, I spoke with my older sister on Thursday re: mom and her AD. (Sis is coming in Monday night and will go back home Saturday.) I wished you had a pulling your hair out smiley to use (LOL) because I do beleive Sis is not going to accomplish a thing. She does NOT want outside intervention (a visiting home worker) because she believes mom would be declared a ward of the state then. Sis believes in the short time she'll be here, she'll be able to get mom to the scheduled Dr appt, get her back on meds and everything will be just fine. I asked her...""What happens when you go back home then?"" Like I mentioned earlier, this sister only comes to visit twice a year for 6 days at a crack. She will not stay longer than that because her coping skills are fried by weeks end. (Not only is she a diabetic, she also takes paxil for depression.) I discussed all this with my husband, who is quite involved with my mothers care and I've come to the conclusion that after sis is finished doing what she believes will work, I'll have to do what is right! I know my mother...she'll put on the ""good"" front and eat those pills until nobody is around for the immediate attention that week. Another problem I have is the house cleaner I hired to just clean her house. Without my knowledge, this woman has been loading my mother up in her vehicle after cleaning and taking her bumming! Does this woman not understand the liability and respsonsibility of doing this? I e-mailed this woman and told her this is to stop immediately. Now, my mother is not speaking to me, nor will let me into her house! I only hired this woman to clean, nothing else! No matter how well my husband and I work at getting my mother back on track, with a stable schedule that she can adhere to, someone comes along and sets everything back. Now...do I fire the housecleaner or let her stay and still have mom con her into a road trip? This woman knows mom has AD and I also brought it to her attention she is off her meds. I'm tired off everyone telling me my mother is ""just fine,"" including my sisters! The Dr and tests revealed AD, why is it they cannot understand mom is NOT alright? This is why my sister wants to take mom to her Tuesday appt....to find out first hand what the health statis is on mom. (Like I would lie?) I think mom has worked her ""behind the scenes"" magic on these people, trying to make them believe ""I'm"" the one with the problem, not her. She has always been a master at manipulation. I reminded my sister of her last visit...how mom did those quirky things like saving in a huge jar all the used poutry timers, how she would not let her cook a thing in her home, teliing sis when she had to go to bed, when it rained...mom shut everything off in the house and handed my sister a flashlight, seeing things in the yard that are not there, saving every piece of junk mail which now a 8 drawer dresser is full to the max of, etc. My sister laughed and said she just thought it was comical....what old people must do. (I don't think so) No, the other siblings will not involve themselves. Afraid that they might end up with mom and be totally responsible for her like I am. All the younger sister is interested in is what she'll get after mom is gone! She's already tried to get mom to give her $25,000 which I put a stop to. I am self employed and leave for work at 6am, return home at 3pm. Administering meds to mom is not an option. Mom keeps screaming at me that ""I can have a life after she's dead."" No...I need my own life now, and I will not let her fall through the cracks and falsey believe what my sister thinks will work, will. Yes, I do hope the Dr can give my sister a reality check and discuss the much needed options with her to deal with the situation I face. My sister will not visit again until late June or July of next year now. Thanks for all the links on AD too. I've been reading them to learn more and more. I guess it all boils down to....what intervention I can receive from the Dr and this sister for the help needed.


 Exactly and if you have Power of Attorney then start the ball rolling Your siblings can help out or they can fight for any monies left to them if they are not actively helping ot AT least here in Ontario Canada I know this can be done Hun could you put your email addy in the little envelope by your name To do this go to Control panel and Edit your Profile ........ if you dont want to I understand Its just that I may have some thigs to help you out as would Snowy I am sure This Lady (snowy is great with all of this and is definitely as asset to this board) I will check again later to see if you do add if not email me okay it is under my name and so is my MSN and Yahoo I can add you so we can do some chatting This is Hades what you and your Mom is goig thru yes she is going thru things to and I know you know and feel her frustration but in turn w/o help you are getting really upset and frustarted as well I can understand believe me You are not being judged at all hun just supported okay God Bless lyn

After a lengthy discussion with my husband, we agree with SnowyLynne that mom does need more than what she's getting now. I just have to wait and see what comes from this Dr appt this morning before I proceed. Thanks for all your support!

 My mother was diagnosed with AD in March of this year. She is presently 85 years old and in great health bodily wise except for AD. The Doctor perscribed ""Namenda"" for her to take twice a day which works rather well! Unfortunately, she stopped taking it well over a month ago. Now, she's back into her confusion state, nasty, sneaky and refusing to go back to the Doctor. Says, she's not eating anymore pills and she just wished she'd die. She's loosing weight fast even though she says she eats. It's like she has turned on me (her sole caregiver) with such vengence and hatefullness. I phoned my older sister to discuss what my next step should be with her because I cannot be there 24/7 watching over her. My sister is planning to come visit next week and try to get her back into see the Doctor. So, she gets her in and the Dr perscribes meds again....how am I suppose to know that she'll take them on a regular basis? Presently, my mother lives next door to me in a house that we built for her 6 years ago. She has become so lazy since she moved here. Will not clean her house....I had to hire someone to do that for her. I've noticed she lax on showering or even paying attention to her appearance. For the past 6 years living next door to me, she has been great at barking orders for people to do things for her than trying to accomplish anything by herself. If I do not jump when she barks at me, she's on the phone hiring someone to come do even the simplest of things for her. When is it time, or how does one know when it is the time to start looking for an assited living facility to place her in? I'm at my wits end. I'm married, have my own responsibilities to face too. Any suggestions?


 Inert thank you wonderfully stated and so true all of it You are an asset to this forum .......... I never did put Mom away she passed away in March this yr.I am goingto bump a thread for you then you see where you liv and check out the homes in area you would be surprised and I think a little in disbelief at what you read ,see and find I am sorry your Mom is doing this but Inert did explain eveything so well to you I looked after Mom for yrs I worked in homes, many actually I had my own retirment home and due to many illnesses I had to retire .Then Mom became my daily and night time care and I would not trade a momoent yes there was anger,bitterness and lots of frustration also there was new memories for me and her we took walks and we did many things together I always could get her out Nature was her thing ....... I have 3 siblings that did not help only one sister in law and brother helped Mom and dad out and yet we always were the ones that did everything wrong (according to mom and others) but we were there always Sometimes they do fear water for whatever reason I am still not sure of that one not all do but you could find a nice outfit tl her you are going to go out and have her have a tubby or shower and do her hair I think EMPATHY has to be the biggest need for the caregiver truly put yourself in her place she has got to be terrified and maybe thats the yelling ya know I know I am afraid when I cannot remember a thing from a few days ago .Just feel the anogy she must feel at having to have everyone do things for her I know you are prob thinking I have no clue that she isnt that way and she is just mean BUT I do have a clue I empathize and I know I wold be so ticked off at losing all of my wonderful memories not knowing my kids my grandkids ect..... I would be fighting mad but then she to may have some good days do you ever have a chance to take her out I think they get frustrated at us because they have to deoend on us and this no doubt is hard for her I agree you did the best in getting someone in to clean There is a newpaper /newsletter from Alzinfo.org that you can also get which has great aticles in it to help the caregiver. I would suggesst you to read some of Padraigs thread (its long but full of info) and feel the love for his wife ......' I hope you will post again I would be more than happpy to talk with you as will others in yellow at the side is Resources in there you may find some things to help as well Post again take care and be well God Bless......Lyn


 Dogger,I am so sorry I can certainly feel you frustration and I feel in some areas rightly so .Okay medication can you put in something she drinks like juice or tea? Perhaps the doctor can help out with that .As for money I guess you have one heck of a situation there she knows and is using ""PowerMoney"" to do what she wants to do .You I commend ,and your sister that isnt taking her diabetes meds she is just asking for an early death and that to me is just not right: however you could still have her come and stay with your mom for a good amount of time splitting bills and chores perhaps this way she is not alone.I think your siblings have to take some responsibility her in all honesty .I have just gone thru this and the moment mom died everything was out of my hands her funeral arrangements everything .My sister donated her body to science ( I agree to a point) and I was not even informed I called about her ashes and was told it wil be a yr before we get them hence I have no closure with mom at all . You can have her declared incompetent and then the money is not right all there for her to spend ya know But I believe it is a hard thing to do the doctor has to be able to help you more with this and maybe a home care worker to come in and stay the day with her and you can get live in .I believe you are being great and I do commend you this is hard top do with our parents we are not supposed to have to do this .Life is not right when the tables are turned like that and I know I felt robbed sometimes because siblings wouldnt help and I was trying to raise Daughter and I am ill as well . I can be here for you maybe a soft place to land and give you support and I will be .Alzinfo .com is also good for reading about this and things AD does new research meds ect ........yes do check out the resources there is plenty in there .Have you read the 36 hour day ? That is a great book and I would really recommend it to you Please take care and keep in touch ......Lyn


 You needto take a stand & stick to it.Do you have POA??If not you need it or get gaurdianship.Your Mom needs more than what she is getting.


 Snowy ...Once again thanks for your help and support you are one Special Lady God Bless Lyn


 Thanks Lyn.Larry had the other knee done in June.Bad thing is he now has no job since they have not contacted him since he took the Dr.release inso he could go back to work.Stuff happens.


 Thanks for posting and letting me (us know) how things are ..... Will be waiting for update Be strong and know you have support here okay Lyn


 Just a quick update.....mom's Dr appt went well. Had to start her back at square one on the Namenda she quit taking over a month ago because of the house cleaner telling mom that Drs over medicate the elderly. Mom is confused a lot of the time, but we are helping her through this. I went to see an attorney to send this cleaning woman a legal notice to stay away from mom, since she's doing more harm than good. I learnt that this cleaning woman was doing much inquiring about moms will, etc too. So, I nipped it in the bud early enough. This woman had enough nerve to phone my mother after this legal paper was served on her to harass my mother, but luckily I was there and took the phone. My sister is coming back in this afternoon, to try and help me get mom to sign a POA. This, the lawyer says is a must after the cleaning woman problem, to protect mom from others. I did pick up and read that book, ""The 36 hour day."" and I thank you so much for suggesting it! Great book! My sister is now reading it too. Another book I found useful was, ""Learning to Speak Alzheimers,"" by Robert N. Butler, M.D. Thanks again for the the support y'all give here. It's nice to know I have some place to come and learn from.


 Do remember that she has to sign POA papers in front of a notory plus she may need witnesses.Be prepared. That's one of the first things I did afer I was diagnosed. Here I am 9 yrs later still doing as I always have done.............anything I want,lol.


 The saga never ends with this house cleaner I fired. She called the Elderly Abuse hotline 5 days after she received the paperwork from my attorney! Naturally, the caseworker had to come out and investigate the claim. She said the claim was ""unfounded"" and it would be closed. How very upsetting and disruptive this was to my mother and my visiting sister. The problem is, is that mom makes statements for attention to others, like....I don't fill her meds or take her grocery shopping, then....says she never said those things. In fact she did because my younger sister reamed my older sister about the accusations mom made to her. (My younger sister is in denial about mom having AD and will not discuss it and is very defensive. This is the siter that only comes to visit mom for one day out of a year.) I am getting so tired of trying to do the right thing and still be questioned why I haven't done this or that. I tell them if they don't like the way I'm handling things, come...take mom and do for her! Nobody is willing to do this. Can anyone tell me exactly what my obligations are towards my mother...when I can say I don't want this responsibility anymore? Both sister's made it clear to mom that they can not take her nor care for her, yet I am always the bad guy. I do from the bottom of my heart for mom and am always upset by these relatives attitudes. My older sister supports me 100% as long as I am the one to take on all the heartache and grief. Be the strong one, as she puts it. I'm burning out, I told her. I did get mom to sign a POA and it's notorized. Office of the aging cannot force any services on my mother. They offered her to visit the senior center to be with folks her own age, but mom refused. They offered to bring in cleaning help, but mom refused. What good is the office of the aging if they cannot get involved? Oh...I guess I'm just very stressed out this week. Any suggestions are welcomed. Thanks for letting me vent here.


 Having POA you can do all legal work & medical decisions in your Mom's care.Someone has to if she can't.Larry helps me but the Dr.will tell him when the time comes to enforce the POA. Lyn,My new Neuro.& family Dr are in agreement that I most likely have MCI rather than AD at this point.MCI (mild cognitive impairment). I still have problems when it comes to legal things & with my lack of hearing or rather understanding words it causes me problems. I guess it could be worse,lol.


 I was on Aricept til it quit working after 4 yrs.I've been on Razadyne the last 4+ yrs.


 Razadyne used to be Reminyl."
Dad died last week,I'm so sorry Rosie.................,"My sweet Rosie I wasnt on yesterday but for a few minutes as my son was in a serious car accident Rosie I am so sorry my heart is aching and tears are running down my face for you sis and your sweet sweet mother I know just what you are going thru I am still grieving myself 'Know he is no longer in pain and he has his total mind back and is now watching out for you and your mom and families Pick a star hun that will be him talk to him he will hear you I promise ' I know he is now with our Higher power and is waiting now for his family to come to him when their time comes I will always be here sis I am that soft pillow you can come fall on okay Please email me and I would get right back to you Again I am so sorry (((((((((((((((((((( ROSIE...MOM.....FAMILY))))))))))))))))))) God Bless and Keep you IN His Arms LOVE ALWAYS Lyn /SIS


 Oh Rosie.. I'm so sorry for your loss.. My heart goes out to you and you and your family is in my thoughts and prayers.. If there is anything I can do, please let me know...


 ((((Rosie)))) Thoughts and prayers are with you and your family,


 You guys are SO sweet. Your love and support is just so comforting. I wasn't prepared for the feelings I'm having. I just hated this darn disease so much that I thought I would be happy to see Dad released from his prison of a body and brain. But . . . . Anyway . . . I am into ""sock therapy"". I am knitting my first pair of socks and have the first one done. They are a nice weight boot sock to really fit my odd combination of huge calves and tiny ankles. Sounds a bit odd . . . but it really is very theraputic. Just one more of the ""final gifts"" I've received from helping care for Dad. I started crocheting and knitting to fill the time I was spending while sitting with Dad after he couldn't enjoy our crafts anymore. Thanks again for your prayers, hugs and well wishes. I was SO surprised to see so many of you found me in the Alzheimer forum. You guys are such a comfort and a blessing. God Bless You!


 Hi Rosie, So sorry to hear of your loss. I know how much time and energy you put into caring for your father -- so very admirable; I don't think I could do it. Please take care of yourself; these are the times when we forget ourselves in our grieving. Even when we think we've accepted that passing will in some ways be a relived, there is always a confusion of conflicting thoughts afterwards. My thoughts are with you and your family, esp. your mother.


 Hi Rosie ((((hugs)))) I know that was a long battle for him, and so hard on you and your sister and mom.... I will be praying that he is with our Lord and Saviour as well.... My prayers are with you all. I'm glad you have your ""sock therapy"". I got a smile on my face when I read that..... Lots of love, Ginny


 Thanks again ladies. You are a dear bunch. I do feel your love and so appreciate it. Blessings!


 Rosie, I lost my dad in '02 and was with him when he took his last breath. Our dads are at peace now. Know that you were there for him when it counted. Hugs, Chutzie


 Hello Rosie I'm so sorry to hear about your dad I know what it's like to lose a parent. You and your family are in my prayers. You take care of yourself and take time for you too. (((Hugs)))


 Hoping you are doing alot of walking down memory lane sis It sure helped me as did doing the thread to MOM....... Love ya so Having my tea now You make the best as always been missing it so. Butterfly kisses to Mom and huggs to you and yours God Bless Lyn/sis


 Heres to a good dinner sis Post and let us know ho things go Luvs ya


 *sigh* Well . . . he's gone. *sigh* Very rough . . . had soooo much hope Tuesday afternoon, as Dad was smiling brightly and in such good spirits. He let me rub his shoulders and neck (previously, we couldn't touch him like that or he would swat at us). I was also able to trim his mustache, beard and eyebrows . . . wow . . . brand new guy! He ate a tiny cup of ice cream, some pudding, and a little bit of mashed potatoes, gravy and peaches. I was teasing him like I always do and he said ""sweetheart"". He even attempted a joke and laughed at it. I have no idea what he was saying, but it was funny. (BTW . . . Mom and I visited on Monday and he looked like he was on death's door. Mouth open, really labored breathing . . . very sad.) Blessing: My daughter was planning to take my mom to the hospital Tuesday, but Justine was sick, so I went. *woo -- oughhhh -- wooo oughhh* . . . so I really received a huge blessing to see Dad feeling so well Tuesday. Anyway, my brother and his wife were up to feed him Tuesday night and he ate a whole roast beef sandwich and everything that came with it. He was doing really well, although he wouldn't tolerate the neck rub. He wanted to stand and even walk around a bit. Then . . . he just stopped breathing. *sigh* With the DNR order if affect, there was no attempt by the hospital staff to assist him. They brought him to his room and got him to bed and my brother and his wife were with him when he died. Hubby took me up to see him one last time *tears* and I'm really glad I went up. Dad looked SO peaceful my heart is full of hope that he is actually with Jesus. I was never sure if he accepted the gift of salvation, but we had talked about it several times, as did he and my sister. Funeral was last Saturday. Have been spending much time with Mom . . . want to make sure she isn't alone too much. Thanks for always being here for me Lynn. This forum has been a huge blessing to me. I hope you and your dad are feeling a bit better this week. Love and Blessings,


 Thanks Snowy I hope you are doing well sis. Blessings!


 Keep those beautiful memories hun always not the bad ones ...... It will help get you thru sis God Bless Butterfly Kisses to you and Mom


 I know I don't know you , and you don't know me , but I know what you're going through ((((HUGS)))) He is smiling on you from above. ((((Take care))))


 Rosie, I wanted to stop in and say how sorry I am that your dad died. How nice though that you got to have a good day with him before he passed away. My thoughts and prayers will be with you, your sister, and your mom. Take care of yourself.


 No one that was touched by you ( and that is so many) could nor would ever forget you sweetie you know that Come and post when you feel the need to be surrounded by your HW family please Luvs ya sis


 Hi alwaysrosie, Just wanted to let you know I am here and thinking of you. I am sorry for your loss for you and your entire family. I am happy that you were able to spend some cool days with your dad. We know Alzheimers can be difficult and the fact of him not swatting at you and joking was real cool. Please take care of yourself and I pray that you and your family stay well. I also pray that you are able to avoid a flare during this time of stress. We are here for you, Leta


 Been thinking bout you and yours all day sis and the socks Love ya Your sis always Lyn


 Please keep in touch hug your mom for me k Love sis


 I am sorry about the loss of your Dad Rosie.((((( Hugs)))))


 My thoughts and prayers are with you Rosie (((hugs))) Ann


 Hey friends, You guys are the best. I was just so blessed by all your kind thoughts and prayers. Yes Lynn, lots of memories! Glad you liked the tea! The whole family (I have 8 brothers and sisters, two of which are now with Dad and Jesus) are having dinner at Mom's tomorrow. We'll all bring part of the meal and spend the evening together. Thanks again for your love and kindness.


 Hi Rosie, I know I'm a bit late, but I didn't want to intrude on your grief. It's been on my mind and so I prayed for you and your family last night. I'll never know what you must have been, and are going through, only those who lost a parent will know your pain. You have been such a great support to so many. Your Dad must have moulded into such a special lady, you do him proud. Take a little time out each day to savour your sweet memories. May your God go with you. Padraig"
parents coming home from vacation,"Hello, Hope everyone is doing well, My parents are coming home from an extended vacation. Mom said today that dad was getting up in the middle of the night and changing his clothes and wondering. She aslo said that he has been very tired and falling asleep during the day alot. I sugguested that we have some alarms set on the doors in their home before they get home and also put some baby proof knobs on the stove. Does any one know of a good alarm system, one that is not a big investment. Any other suggestions to make their home safer for them? Any info would be great. I also suggested that she go to a support group so that she can learn how to better care for him but she did not want to hear about any of that. Wow this disease is awuful. Thanks","Thanks Lyn....


 Hi there Please see the Thread I did on Wandering It may give you some help and some ideas as well Take care


 Not a problem at all hun Be well and hope to see you around"
My Mother,"For reasons that I do not want to get into, I had been estranged from my mother for a few years. I found out accidentally two days ago that she has been in an nursing home since August. I have been crying ever since. I went to see her today and she was kind and gentle. We both cried and I am so darn upset that my brother put her there. He is basically the reason we did not see each other. He did not even call me to let me know that she was in the nursing home with Alzheimers. I was told that she is in stage 5. My mother has no short term memory, but she can remember things that happened years ago. I was told that she accidentally overdosed on her meds, tried to leave the house in the middle of the night, pacing and rooting through trash cans. It breaks my heart to see her like this. I so desparately want to bring her home with me. I am retired. She says that she knows that she has to be there annd feels safe. She also says that she would rather be on the outside but knows this is best for her. How could I prevent her from wandering and cooking in the middle of the night and leaving the stove on? Do you think that at this point she does need to be there and I am being selfishfor wanting her home with me. I love her so much and always have and I hate to see her there. She can shower and dress herself and care for her bodily functions and she is not wheel chair bound. She can also feed herself. She is just so darn scared.","I bumped that Nursing Home thread for you If you need to talk hun I am here I know what you are going thru I really do and I would not mind talking to you privately for support for both of us Lyn Info under name


 It could be that your taking your Mom out so often the state thinks she doesn't need to be there.Being on state aide means they have to stay in the facility but can go to church on Sundays.Moving here most likely would be detrimental to her well being,so if you do take her home you wouldn't be able to travel with her.You would be staying home to care for her,esp.In stage 5............


 Wondering how things are going and what the outcome of all this has been As well wondering how you are feeling


 Thamks for keeping me in the loop I am really glad the place she is in is clean and she is taken well care of Goping to the Senior centre is a good thing as she will have stuff to do and meet others as well Keep me posted will you How are you feeling BTW


 Hi there......... I looked after my mom at home she could basically do most things for self as well she passed away in March this yr I know it is a very hard job but it has many rewards and if SHE wants to come home to try it with you I think that would l be the best IMO I also look after my dad who now is with alzheimers It is demanding on your time but fulfuls your heart so much This is something you must really decide for self I have crohns and other illnesses but I am still able to look after dad ........'There are safety controls such as they have for kids for stoves and all that so do please check into it 'Meanwhile I will bump the NH ratings here and you see if she is in one of those places I am so sorry this has come to happen Please continue to post God Bless Lyn


 I really appreciate your support. I thought that things were going pretty well. She is about 1.5 hours away from where I live, so I only get to visit three times a week. I take her out to lunch and we go shopping and have really nice times. The more I see her, I realize that things are not always as they seem. She can get angry easily and she does have some incontinent issues which she denies, along with her confusion. The state has decided that they will now not pay for the nursing home. Mom is just so upset. The director called her into his office and gave her this news with my brother on the phone. I am really annoyed that the home did not have a family member present for her. She has a 30 day appeal. I have lyme disease and my doctor advised me not to bring her home with me. When I saw her on Sunday, she had her things all packed. She forgot about the appeal and was very upset about leaving the home. She has made good friends and she wants to stay. I saw her again on Monday and she was somewhat better. I have also been advised, since we have this appeal, to not take her on outings until this is resolved. So, I stop and bring it lunch for her and her friend. I am still on the fence about bringing her home with me. I can not afford to pay for the nursing home. The state wants her in assisted living, which my brother says he can afford to pay. I am fearful that her being moved will make her get worse. We travel alot, DH for work and I go with him. I wonder if I could take her as well???? So many questions and I do not know what I should do.


 Thanks Snowy great input and to the point as per the norm Lyn How are you n Larry doing??


 Thanks for asking. The nursing home did not wait until the end of the 30 day appeal. She still had about two weeks left on the appeal and they wanted her out right away. She is in an assisted living facility, further away from me, paid by Medicaid. I now visit her once or twice a week. The facility is in a home and there is just not that much for her to do. She does go to a senior center once a week and enjoys that very much. She does not want to come and live with me. She fears that she will get worse and that I could not handle it. The place she is in is very clean and well taken care of."

 Look forward to it Mom went same way and with Alzheimers I do feel your pain Lyn


 I thought I answered the post hum.. Anyhow this has been a real trying few days..I got a horrid migrain yesterday had to take the meds for it.that makes me so tired..it accured I am sure from decisions my adult children and children in-laws are making that are POOR I also have a flare up in my knee and it is twice what it should be. I took Larry my husband to doctor on Wed. They are changing him from Aricept to Razadyne ER they also put him on an antidepressent. It is called remeron. ANyhow the pain in my knee is nothing compared to the pain in my heart watching the man I love go through this. We have been married 22 years and together 23. He has raised my children from 3,2,and newborn. He has always been the best you know what I mean..I think of my ""X"" husabnd who never cared about his children and all the abuse he gave me. Why is he not sick why Larry. OK I AM BETTER


 SnowyLynne may I ask how old you are? My husband id 53 this past November. He was diagnosed about 2 years ago. Hookswife


 Sometimes my husband said he feels like the easier something is that he should know the more up set he gets at himself it is very hard for him as we have no support groups for early onset Ad around here.


 yes he is finally getting to where he will tell especially our grown children you know I just cant figure it out. They are 22,23,25 he was alwaysy trying to spare them that he was not able now he just says I cant. I now tell them that he cant hanle their stressful problems and they are going to have to grow up maybe I am being selfish I dont know. he always was the bread winner and I stayed home , he was as our oldest said superman and ways laughter is so good. Larry will laugh when I say you know we watched that whatever it might be and he says the good thing about Ad is these are all new to me lolol


 Well, today I am really in a mess tears all over the place. I have so many crazy things going on currently. Our oldest nephew my husbands name sake will be shipping out on Jan. 3rd 18 months away from his children and wife. Very envovled family and now he will be in a scary place. Anyhow hubby and he had a great talk. Hubby is so funny, they talked football and when he was off the phone he said man I cant believe I remembered all that. Then said laughing or maybe he is being polite and dint correct me...lol humor is good. I have been on Cymbalta for my neck nerve damage and now I ran out I think that is why I feel like all this is so much. I mean it has been a really crazy few months. Anyhow I shall prevail the Lord has me in His Care. Chilkoo

 Hello, I am doing alright. We had a nice Christmas and now my husband is messing with the new stuff he got from me..Christmas eve was a bit crazy for him due to the Alz me do to my lack of sleep the night before and pain in my joints. BUT, it was fun. My husband is 53 was diagnosed with the alz 2 years ago. His father died of it at age 72. My step grandfather at 75 we know whats going on so to speak . Larry however is on meds something they did not have at the time. He is on disability ss and has been at home. He cant do his old job that he provided us an income, he had injuries from on the job. Long story anyhow. But they now claim because he was diagnosed with Alz and cant retrain it is our problem Our lawyer howeverhas helped them to see different. This really takes a toll on my husband the constant on and off with the L&I people. Anyhow I am so happy to have a place to talk. Hook tenders wife that should read good but if it werent for God I would be crazy... Post Edited (chilkootpass) : 12/26/2006 4:38:26 PM (GMT-7)

 It depends on how much is saved by going 120 miles round trip.The price of gas can eat up the savings"
Net bed?  Where to purchase?,"My father has alzheimer's and has recently suffered a stroke. He can no longer walk but he forgets this of course and tries to get up out of bed in the night. In the hospital he had a special ""net bed"" that zipped up over the bed which prevented him from getting out. We have tried to find a bed such as this to purchase - searched online to no avail. Does anyone know where we can buy this saftey bed? He is back at home now and we are getting desperate because he cannot be left alone for a minute because he will fall. Help please. Thank you.","Thanks so much Lyn. We actually finally found a company that sells them, right after I posted this. It's called vivaxmedical.com for anyone else interested. They call it a canopy bed and it seems to be just what we needed. My mother asked at the hospital and they said we can expect to spend $5,000. (yikes!) But if it keeps him safe, it's worth it. This has been so difficult - as if the Alzheimer's wasn't enough (he was in the very early stages - just very forgetful and sometimes confused) now the stroke, and no longer the use of his leg) has really thrown us for a loop. I will check back on this site - I am sure there is good information for our family. Thanks again.


 Ask the hosp.where they got the net bed.


 He's still goingto rehab 3 times aweek.He walks great but we just need to get the kneecap to cooperate.They are doing strenghening exercises with him now.


 Hoping input here will help those looking for Net beds

 Is there ANY way you can get some kind of supplemental help to pay for this ........I have a canopy over my daughters bed and it was only 20.00 if you or your Mom are handy with crafts /sewing a zipper could always be put in it and saves lots of money ........of course you would have to get a more heavy duty one then I have for Cait I know all about what AD can do hun my Mom just passed away 5 months ago today and I am still looking after my step Dad who is also stricken with this horrid disease.......... I was a geriatric nurse and saw many peeps with this but never did I expect my parents to get it ya know ......Enjoy an drelish every moment with your Dad please......make new memories ,yes even silly and fun ones .......you will never ever regret it .......please do continue to come here as the support and peeps are fantastic .......and I am sure you have input to help others as well ......

 Got one for Dad and got it at the ""Medical Pharmacy"" here in Chatham They are out there and this wasnt too costly either WAY way below 5000 and I was able to get some help from gov for costs ........."
When loved ones get upset over things out of your control?,"I find My Mary's logical thinking seems in the mist most of the time and she will tell me how to do things. and I will explain to her what I am doing and why and she will go into a long detailed reason that is unreasonable for doing something that I can't do! Then as I try to tell her why her comment to me always ends up with her saying ""Look I'm Old not stupid"" which makes me feel horrible that she would think I was even saying such. I suppose silence is golden and it's best just to say nothing or explain nothing! Which for me because this is new is hard to do for in the past it would of only been a matter of rational discussion and now it's not! I find for me as a way to regain my own sanity I have to leave the room and/or get out of the house when she begins to yell at me such things! Forgive me I just went through such an episodes with her and at the moment I am venting my own frustrations! Rabbin","You must remember she is not in ""our""world anymore just in ""her"" world.So you stay in her world it's alot better.Just go with the flow & don't worry.


 Have you been diagnosed with Alzheimer's? If you feel you have a problem, have your Dr refer you to a good Neurologist.


 You cannot reason with a person with this disease IMO Sometimes it is better for them to go into their world ya know it is not hard to do at all Less frustration and aggitation for all involved


 Please dop not apologise for being or getting frustrated you are going to and more down the raod thats why we are here Support and Empathy go along way here Each of us already are or have been where you are right now Perhaps not all things you are gonna do but soem lil things take in front of her and just say ""Well Mary how do you supose we can fix this / (make it simlpe and go along with it Other harder more troublesome things take out to another room or find your self a lil ""Zone"" where you can get some things done if possible I am sure others will have more suggestions I would just leave it when Mom got like that change subject and then go back to it whilst she was napping Wishing all the best Healing Energy God Bless you Both Lyn


 my disease acts alot like MS, but I' ve been diagnosed as Alzheimers. I go two to four day deep in it, can't write a letter, losing inportant passwords, in twilight seeing things, lose my balance, then it mostly comes backs. Is that alzheimers?

nursing home,"I just needed to let someone know that I recently had to put my 47 year old husband in a nrsing home with locked ccdi unit- they say he has lewy body dementia.....The guilt I am feeling for this is unbearable-eventhough everyone including docs say that this is the best place for him. i work 2 jobs and he needs 24 -7 care at this point. I just cant stand to see him in a place like this -he needs help eating, dressing and all daily activities, i tried keeping home for awhile-with help from relatives, but it got to be too much for them also. is it true that people with dementia do better in home with like individuals where thier routine is the same every day?

 Sandra Wondering how you are doing Luvs LYN"
Not sure what to do,"Hello, I am new to this site and looking for lots of answers. My Mom is 63 years old and I am very afraid she has the onset of AD. Although she will not go to the doctors or admit she has a problem. She has severe short term memory loss. She often doesn't realize that she has asked us things ten times or we have just told her what time we are leaving to go somewhere. Just recently she was watching my niece and nephew. We fed them lunch together. Then I left. I came back 1 hour later and she was feeding them lunch again. I said Mom, what are you doing. She said it is lunch time I am feeding them lunch. I said Mom we just fed them chicken nuggets. She said oh yeah. I am not sure if she really remembered or not. My Dad is no longer alive so it is up to my sister and I to take care of her. I don't know what to do , I think I need to get her help, but how. Her health otherwise is very good. Please help me.","how are things going


 Welcome I am so sorry you have had to come here but here at least you will find answers and get support It sounds like your mom is in need of a doctor preferably.......... Neuroligist....SHE needs this IMO This type of doc will give her the going over and tests to see what she is at on the scale ......... Medications do help with some when caught in time sounds like she is not that bad so far * I found my dad out wandering in Pajamas at 12:30 am the other night said he was going to get mail ......* I have just lost my mom past March and it is still raw and hurts like Hades I looked after her too Please know you are not alone and I will try to help you out as much as I am able Resources in yellow at side are great too I recommend the ""36 Hour Day"" Book Please post and let me know whats happening ..... God Bless Lyn"
HELp!!!???,"Hi!My grandpa was diagnosed with Alzheimers years ago (Hes 85 now)and hes really going down hill.Hes at home still(My grandmother died 1 1/2 years ago)so my aunt Is taking care of him.Hes getting soooooooooo skinny and Is totally dependent on Diapers(depends)and cant really go anywhere or walk good.He doesnt know too much anymore and is easily irritated.Now hes having hallucinations-Is this all normal?Is he In a late stage??Any help would be appreciated,my family doesnt know alot about this disease.His meds are-Reminyl(4 mg)Zyrexa(5mg)Altace (2.5mg)I sure would love to know more.Thanks!!!","Sandy, Your grandfather is probably reaching the end stage of senility or altzhiemers. For our elderly, nutrution plays a huge role in their memory and every day health so consider his food intake daily. Unrinary tract infections are another problem that rarely show symptoms in the elderly and cause incontience. All of the above can problems with memory and hallucinations as well as altzheimers. Make sure your physician is aware of your grandfather's deteriorating condition and see if he can order home health so a Nuse can evaluate his condition and make suggestions. The Nurses should also be able to get your family some relief with bathing and daily care. Good luck and I hope you can help your grandfather live comfortably. It's wonderful he has someone as concerned as you in his life.


 Yes,Nameda was approved,& my Insurance covers it when my time comes to take..........


 Sandy,with all the imformation out out there,your family needs to learn about it,teach them...........


 The love & feelings are still there,you just need to know how to get it out,but if he's too far into the disease,you may never..............


 THANKS FOR ALL THE REPLIES!MYGRANDFATHERS DIED sEPT 24,2004


 How are you making out hun I do know what you are going thru honestly Lyn


 Sandy,Yes this is normal for him. I was dx with Alzheimer's 6 yrs.ago.I was on Aricept the first 4 years.I now take Renimyl the full dose of 24 mg.per day.


 hey there, i'm not quite sure of the drugs out there, but i do know that namenda is undergoing testing or has been approved for use. you can check out more news stories regarding alzheimer's at www.alzinfo.org i found the site to be very helpful and highly credible. best, pilot


 In a way, you could say I know plenty. Both of my grandparents have this disease. I lost my grandfather in 1998 to it. My grandma was diagnosed in 1999. She "" had "" to have some heart surgery or whatever and they blamed lack of Oxygen to it. There, I believe, are many different types and phases of this disease because we ended up having to put my grandfather in a home because no matter how closely we watched him, he was still able to sneak out the house; my grandma on the other hand is in a hospital bed on an air mattress. My dad works for a Home health Care thing and so it was very easy for us to be able to find assistance in taking care of my grandma. Yes, it is 2004 and she is still here. She was born in 1919, too. All I can really say is make your grandpa as comfy as possible. My grandma is so far gone that we can barely get enough nutrition down her, and she doesn't show pain. She takes Hydrocodone (still, I think), for pain when they had to extract some teeth that she was literally chewing away. She is in diapers and we have a nurse who comes 3 days a week that changes her and bathes her. It has been really stressful because my mom has been forced to work on weekends only now since I and my sister and brother have gotten older and are in college now (Sophomore, Junior, ""Senior""). My sister still has a few more years of school before graduating and then will be planning a wedding. And, I, am soon to go off to a university and leave the Community college atmosphere. You may want to see if your city has anything like a Home Health Care Service in which a nurse, aide, whatever, will come to the house, most likely 3 times a week, and do what is needed to help you take care of your grandfather. The service we use also has a 24 hour on call unit where if my grandma has a ""seizure"" they will come out and assist the inncident and do/call whatever whomever needed to make it pass. Please let me know if this helps and whatnot! Sincerely, AuSsie


 Hi Sandy, My dad passed away from Alzhiemer's in a nursing home. I got to his bedside on his last day but an hour too late and didn't get the chance to say good-bye. I would say to you, talk to him all the time and help him remember all the good times and how much he means to you. Try to get him to drink lots of liquids if he is able because I believe dehydration really intensifies the symptoms of the disease. The late stage for my dad was when he refused food (or just couldn't remember how to eat or swallow). Still, I always believed he could hear and understand what we said to him even though he couldn't respond so let him hear your loving words. My Love to you and your family


 Sandy, You and your family need to watch these videos that my family has. They are called The Family's Guide to Alzheimer's Disease. I am not kidding...these helped us sooo much. It made all our problems more managemable. I don't think we could live without them. They are hosted by Leeza Gibbons, and I think you can buy them online at the Lifestyle resources website. Hope this helps.


 So sorry for your loss ** Always remember HE is watching over you at all times and is no longer in pain ........** Lyn

Sundowners question,"Hi Lyn (and everyone else ), I have a question about Sundowners. My 87 year old grandmother is in the hospital and has been there for the past 4 days due to a bladder procedure. But during her stay there, she has been majorly confused and disorientated. She is normally a little ""out of it"" at home (she lives with me) but she has never been this confused before. The nurses said that it's Sundowners and for the 2 past nights at the hospital, they've had to strap her down because she was getting violent with the nurses and trying to get out of bed. So my question is, how typical is it for her mental status to go back to normal once she is home with familiar surroundings? Have anyone heard of Sundowners subsiding after getting home? I guess I'm trying to prepare myself if in the event that it doesn't go away. I love my gma dearly but I won't be able to care for her properly if she stays this confused. And it breaks my heart just thinking of putting her in a home, but I don't see any alternative if her confusion lasts. Thanks","Thanks Lyn :) Things were way rough this morning when I got to the hospital, but I managed to calm my gma down in about 15 minutes. I was able to stay with her for about 3 1/2 hours but then I had to come home for my kids. I sincerely hope that this only a temporary thing and I'm wishing that when I go there tomorrow that she will be a little more in her head. They're going to try changing a few of her meds to see if that helps. It's always nice to have hope isn't it??


 Hi Sherry With my mom it did subside ONCE home she was so upset and disoriented from being in the hospital and was angry I had let her go there lol She had pneumonia at the time and what else could I do as well her COPD was really in uproar Sometimes if it goes too long or gets way outta control to be honest and thats what I want to be with you No it probably wont change BUT thats not to say her attitude will not change at all it will or I should say should get somehwhat back to the "" norm"" when home and in her 'Safe Zone"" The other good place to look for about this is alzinfo .com in our HW resources I know mom was okay when she got home actually took just a couple of days and then her anger and frustration was mostly all gone but for a few times when she would revert back to hospital memories I wish you all the best and your grama too Please know I am keeping you""s in thoughts and prayers It is a great thing that you have her at home with you I feel it is a blessing most times yet it can be a rough road too Please dont hesitate to come over n chat about it okay Snowy is our resident expert on many things here as well ..lol Take care LYN


 Really when it comes to this DD thats all there is and it is sad at times .It just robs us of so much and them of course Hoping you have a better day and your gma too.maybe chaging meds is what will help Lyn"
sundowners in children,"Hello, I was hoping someone can help me. My friend's son has been in and out of the hospital for the last three to four months .He is back in now . They think he might have Sundowners. But I've looked and I can't find anything about children that have it. I've never heard of a child with Sundowners . Could some please help me if you can. Thank You . cna252000","Thank you Lyn for your reply. I'm glad I found this site . My friend's son is 15 . His mother thinks now that zantac may of had some bad side effects on him. I thank you for your reply very much. Hope you have a nice weekend.


 How are things going post and let me know when you can plz Lyn


 Sorry . I haven't been on in awhile . All work and no play. Hope you and your family have a Happy Valentine. Bye.


 Hi there I dont know where else you could look .I do know I have seen in the past when nursing :kids that I now believe had Sundowners but they were not DX early and with difficulty . I have seen so much of it with in our seniors with AD and some non AD er's I wish i could be more help but all i can say is I hope they find a good tx plan for that lil guy .......Glad you found us here post again if you would like there is lots of support on this site ....

"Hallucinations, Parkinson's Dementia, and Razadyne","My wife was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1995 . . takes Mirapex, Sinemet, and Amantadine for PD. Recently has had heavy bouts of hallucination. Her doctor has reduced and attempted to balance her meds over the 24 hour day to see if the meds might be causing the hallucinations. So far this hasn't helped. It also appears that there are different kinds of hallucinations . . my wife, Elinor is seeing things that are not there or happening, like there are critters in the house or our giant popular tree is moving up and down to let our neighbors cat pass under, and there are workers camping out on our deck in freezing weather. Other people talk about seeing ""green and pink lace patterns on all white surfaces"". (Elinor does not appear to have any other symptoms of AD that I read about ) I was wondering if the Razadyne ER is going to help my wife Elinor with her hallucination problems combined with the effects of Parkinson's disease?? And, how long should I expect to wait to see results?? (she has just taken her 7th 8mg capsule) Any other advice would be greatly appreciated!! Tom","I have been on Razadyne the last 5 yrs with no problems..........


 Hoping you finally got the input from Snowy Lyn


 Welcome Tom I would imagine it will take a few more doses of that med to finally kick in to help her There is a Parkinsons Forum on here that may be better help but I sure am glad you found us It is hard to look after those we love but rewarding isnt it in the end I looked after Mom till she passed and now look after Dad he has AD as well I hope I have been of some help to you All the best for the Holidays and a better 2007 to you and your wife God Bless Lyn


 Thanks sooooooooo Much Snowy Hey I am so glad you got a new puter for Christmas ............. I needs your knowklege her ya know . All the best to you and Larry for Christmas and 2007 I sure hope your tests go great as well Luvs ya 'Lyn"
Is sedation appropriate?,Hi and Welcome No in my opinion you should have her seen by a doctor and have her given the medication needed for these outburts ......... Many of our loved ones are affected and do have these my mom did occasionally as well I am glad to have you here and hope you continue to post and get support it is not easy being the caretaker and doing it without any support is worse I hope I have helped Take care and let us know what doc has to say .......... Be well Thoughts and prayers are with you Lyn,"Haldol is another BAD medication.Any of the sedatives can keep her a mess.Trazadone os good low dose of course to start.75mg was fine for me but 150mg made me a zombie.Always start low does then you can work your way up late as needed.


 Hi Sara Just wondering if you have read the posts on here yet How are things going with you and Mom LYN


 Oh my..I think this pill is a reject...My mom has become 5 times worse since we started giving it to her and instead of calmer she seems way more agitated and restless..I`m beginning to think our family doctor who my brother insists on taking her to doesn`t really know what he`s doing in this area


 >>>>>Sara what is the name if the med some will cause things to become worse ' If you get the chance please let me know ...<<<< OK I just checked..The new medication she is on is called Zyprexa and she takes 2.5 mg....She also takes Namenda...And she takes Femara, Warfarin and Digitek for breast cancer...She seems calmer now than she was earlier but it`s hard with all this tension wondering when she`ll have another episode


 If possible, you might try letting her wander a bit, much like a toddler. Don't intervene unless she is doing something that may harm herself or others. Sometimes, in the disorientation, they like to re-familiarize themselves with their environment, just to be sure that everything is where it should be. My daughter works daily with Alzheimer's patients and often finds that letting them go on about their business is better for them than trying to fit them back into our schedule and timing. She had been instructed to 'bring them back to the here and now and reality' and discovered that usually brought on tears and struggles. She has been able to engage them in conversation about what is going on in 'their' world and gently integrate it into the task at hand to get daily living activities accomplished. She gave me the example of one of her ladies who just doesn't like to wash her face in the morning... but she loves giving herself a 'facial' with the nice cloths that the 'spa' provides. My daughter figures that if this lady would like to be at a spa and be in a better mood there... Voila! That's today's topic of conversation and the day goes smoothly. Sending prayers and good thoughts your way as you do your best for this lady you love. You are truly a good daughter.


 Sara The only med I see as a problem and this is MY opinion is the zyprexa There have been tests and studies done about this med and the elderly with AD and most of it suggests NONE use .......... Again my opinion My thought are with you Take care Lyn


 Hello..Yes thank you I had done that already..It doesn`t sound as if it is very good for elderly people..I will pass all this info along with my concerns to my brother who is my mothers legal gardian and makes all the medical decisions for her


 I hope you will post and let us know what the doc says hun Keeping you in thoughts always and your Mom LYN


 There is a better way to do that and you are right no reasoning for her will help with the bathing Some just DO not llike it sometimes their brain is telling them things are not right and this might be one of thenm I am sure she was a private woman who never showed herself( prolly not even to hubby and now has to deal with othrs seeing and bathing her...... I had special talks with mom while I bathed her and it was totally different now if anyone else had tried she would have done like your mom does ..... Perhaps you can post a link to your ""stardom"" in the paper here for us What else is going on maybe I can be of some help 'Know I am here to listen and support hun be well LYN


 SO true Snowy so true ...... It worked for me as I said as I told mom we would be having company or going out and then she was okay with it BUT not really long ones lol THANKS for your input


 She`s still on it for now untill her next doctor visit..She`s semed quieter the past few days except for when my nephew trys interrogating her about stuff or tries to teach her things so she remembers next time how to do them...She gets more confused and disoriented then....Here`s a link to the story I mentioned earlier in the local paper I am in..I am the one in the top left of the photo with the long blonde hair http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=13393


 Hello all...My 84 year old mother has Alzheimer's and we are attempting to care for her here at home as best we can...Normally she is ok but sometimes she starts having major delusions and won`t listen to any sort of reason and the situtaion can become quite frustrating for us..Is it wrong that we might consider some sort of sedative for her at these times?...We are trying to keep her at home as we have no finances to put her in a decent home and we are skeptical of the care she`d get at some sort of government public assistance place..Thanks in advance


 There is ONE sedation I do not think should be given to AD patients and I know plenty agree with me on this and oit is Ativan or another name for it is Lorazepam Can and most likely will cause further emotionally charged instances Just an opinion Lyn Also I do suggest checking resources at side in yellow and finding books on this 36 hour Day is a good one in my opinion it is very frustrating at times but I feel that you keeping her home is a GOOD thing...hard sometimes but worth it I looked after Mom ( passed away almost a yr ago) and now am looking after my step dad I worked in NH and had own Retiement homes and yes sometimes ( most) care is at the low end and the loved ones suffer more and progress faster I think anyways Keep posting getting support and reading other posts and threads there are quite a few great ppl on here and very supportive ......Lyn


 Thanks Snowy I was hoping for your input Lyn How are you doing and Larry


 Hello..Yes thank you all for the nice replies...My brother took my mother to the doctors yesterday afternoon and he perscribed a new medication for her (I`ll have to check the name of it) which he said may help calm her and cut back on her hallucinations....She seems to get worse later at night and I am thinking my brother and nephew contribute to her disorientation as they both have little patience and end up demanding answers from her or interrogating her if she starts to wander or get up..If I talk with her I always allow her the time to search for an answer herself even if it takes a minute or two and makes no sense..But they will keep rapidly asking for an answer and if she doesn`t answer right away they get more insistant..""What do you want?..WHAT do you want????""..I think sometimes she doesn`t really want anything but simply wants to wander from one room to another but they feel if she gets up and starts walking she has to want something and they are determined to find out what..Oy Post Edited (SaraTG) : 3/3/2007 2:48:59 PM (GMT-7)


 Sara what is the name if the med some will cause things to become worse ' If you get the chance please let me know Email me as well if you want info under name LYN


 Sarah,I agree the brother & nephew are adding to her stress.Tell them to lay off.


 Thanks for the input Jeannie we have often talked about going to "" their world "" it does keep them calmer most times and has them have less depression and outbursts LYN


 Sara Go to the Google up top and put in the med and you will find out what I did as well I have a med book here that I used during my career LYN


 I am glad you will be doing this please let us know how it goes HOw are you doing hun and yer Mom ** I love the poem in your sig ** LYN


 >>>>I am glad you will be doing this please let us know how it goes. How are you doing hun and yer Mom ** I love the poem in your sig **<<<< I have a zillion other worries I deal with beside my mom so I`m doing fine..If all goes as planned I shall be on the cover of the local free paper this Wednesday so I get to be a small celebrity for a bit ..My niece is here now getting ready to give my mom her Sunday shower and my mom always HATES that so I expect some yelling..And my neice gets frustrated quickly and gets abrupt with her which doesn`t help..Usually after it drags on to long my mom will start yelling, ""Let me out of here! God darnit! Somebody help me!""..And instead of hurrying and finishing the shower off at that point my neice actually seems to get slower or tries to reason with my mom telling her to wait just a minute or two..Then mom is extra disoriented and aggitated the whole rest of the night..Oy..Unfortunately I am but a guest in the house here so I have only so much input as to how they do things I need to change my sig lines...That`s actually from a song and I used that a coupple of years ago when I posted on the heart board here a lot


 You CAN NOT reason with a person with Alzheimer's.Redirect her to something else,sheesh!

sundowners synrome,"i have a question....i have a friend whose mother is acting strangely....it started when his brother had gotten into trouble with drugs and was sent to prison...his mother is now even during the day thinking that some of his drug dealers are out to kill her...she is hearing things....and says they have called and said they were on their way....she says they are outside the door....she has even hid in the closet thinking that ""they"" are there....this happens during the day as well as the night...she has called 911 so much that they will not even come out anymore....at night she is awakened with hearing them in the house...she does this whether she is home with someone staying with her or whether she is at someones house...she says that now ""they"" are out to get the rest of the family....could this be signs of sundowners syndrome?",HI there sounds to me like this friend needs to have Mom assessed and see what is going on with her ......

Our beloved friend has Alzheimer's,"Hello everyone. I've posted in your forum before about volunteering in nursing homes with my therapy dogs. Many of the residents have Alzheimers, and I want to thank all of you that replied to my post several months ago. I have such great admiration and gratitude to all of the caregivers of Alzheimer's patients, as well as to the Alzeheimer's patients themselves. With my two therapy dogs, we have visited many facilites over the last several months, including our local hospital, schools, libraries, and nursing homes. By far, however, we have most enjoyed our visits to the loving and gracious residents of the nursing homes. We have befriended one resident, and she has become near and dear to our hearts. She is an 87 year old woman with beautiful eyes and a precious smile. Her heart is as big as Texas. Before she entered the nursing home, she had to find a home for her beloved dog, which devastated her beyond descript ion. Therefore, my dogs and I have helped her cope with an otherwise difficult life in the nursing home. To say the least, we have been honored and blessed to meet this precious lady. When my dogs and I visit our special friend, she always invites them into her bed, which they gladly accept. As she pets and hugs my soft and warm dogs, we talk and exchange stories. For the most part, she is usually sharp as a tack. On some occasions, however, I've noticed that her memory begins to fade, and she begins to confuse the present with the past. This particularly happens whenever she is stressed or tired. For example, when we visited last week, she initially seemed fine. She told me all about her childhood and shared some wonderful stories with me about growing up in the 1930's. Then, right before we were getting ready to leave, she asked what time the dogs had their class that night. I was confused and asked her again what she meant. She repeated the same question, and this time, she was slightly agitated. After thinking about it, I responded, ""Yes, they go to school tonight. And they didn't do their homework, so the teacher will be mad!"" That made her laugh, and she appeared content again. My dogs completed their obedience classses two years ago, when they were puppies, which was before we had ever met her. So, she must have been confusing my situation with one from her past. I was later told by her caretaker that our dear friend has been diagnosed with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. I suppose that I wasn't surprised by that, but it still broke my heart. Now, this dear lady feels like a grandmother to me. I'm now trying to learn all that I can about Alzheimer's, and that is why I'm posting in this forum. If anyone can shed some light on this disease with me, I'd greatly appreciate it. What is the best way to respond to her when her memory begins to lapse? Is it best to respond like I did with the dog school question? Also, I've noticed that our friend starts to get REALLY upset with herself when she can't remember something. For example, she was talking about how much she enjoys reading books, and she said that she really wanted to read one particular book. She couldn't think of the name of the book, and she was getting really frustrated and angry at herself for her memory lapse. I asked her what the book was about , and she remembered that it had something to do with an artist. ""The Da Vinci Code?"" I answered. ""YES!"", she said with excitement. ""That's it. I really want to read it!"" Then, she calmed down considerably. She asked if I had the book, which I do, and she asked if she could read it. So, during our next visit, I took the book to our dear friend, and her eyes lit up when she saw it. A big smile took over her face. I realized that she most likely would not be able to read the book, but I went ahead and took it to her anyway because just seeing the book was therapeutic in and of itself for her. Does my logic make sense to anyone, or should I have just not taken her the book? Even though she hasn't tried to read it, she is proudly displaying it on her telephone stand. It doesn't matter to me whether or not she reads it. Goodness, I haven't even read it! I just don't know if I did the right thing in taking her that book. Also, what is the best way to respond to her when she starts to get frustrated and angry with herself when she can't remember something? I'm sorry for my rather long post. My dogs and I care about our sweet friend immensely, and we want to support her in every way possible. Even though her memory fades from time to time, she ALWAYS remembers my two dogs and myself. Recently, she looked me straight in the eye and thanked me for being her friend. ""You have provided me with something to look forward to every day,"" were her exact words. She has done the same for us. It scares me that Alzheimer's may rob her mind completely in the coming months. We will be there for her, no matter what, and I just want to make sure that I will be as good of a friend as possible. Again, I would greatly appreciate any information anyone can share with me. Thanks so much. With kind regards, Ali","How are you doing today ....God Bless..Lyn

 Hi Lyn, Thank you so, so much for your reply. It means volumes to me. I hope that it was okay that I posted in the Alzheimer's forum. Even though this dear lady is not a family member, she certainly feels like one. And thank you for asking how I'm doing too. How incredibly caring of you. For the past couple of days, I've been having a really hard time. Sometimes, life stressors can add up to become rather overwhelming. Yesterday, my nursing home friend took me out to lunch at a local restaurant. Her estate manager/power of attorney picked her up from the nursing home and brought her to the restaurant. It brought tears to my eyes that this wonderful lady wanted to take me to lunch. We had a good time, and I will always cherish every minute I get to spend with this precious lady. The waitress asked her what her name was yesterday, and she couldn't remember. But she knew my name, as well as the names of my dogs. Also, thank you for letting me e-mail you sometime. I'll take you up on that in the next few days. I wish that I could do more to help my friend. She has no family left, and she often feels very alone. Yesterday, the waitress took a picture of my friend and I at the restaurant table, and once I transferred the image off my digital camera and onto my camera, I started crying buckets. I've grown so close to her, and it hurts so bad that she is having to deal with all of these problems during the final phase of her life. Thank you again, and God bless. Ali


 Thanks Snowy for your input ..always appreciated ...... Ali ......you are more than welcome to post here anytime thats what this forum is for the caretakers,loved ones and families / friends .........you are a great friend to this Lady and I am so proud of you for giving your time and love it is a hard DD to deal with at times and most peeps will not take on the responsibily even .......Family!!

Soya Lecathin?,"I was talking to a lady the other day that swears that a relative of hers with dementia has improved since taking Soya Lecathin. I know it wouldnt work for all types of Dementia,but aparently, sometimes there is a bulid up of fats on the brain and the lecathin is supposed to help break down these harmful fats. My sister has been taken off Arecept so I cant see any reason why we couldnt try her with Lecathin,hopefully the Doctor will say it is ok. I am not expecting miracles,I just thought that it might be worth trying it. Has anyone else heard anything about this stuff? Thanks.","Hi Baglady, Did you doc ever give you the ok on the lecathin?? funny thing is, I make my own dog food and one of the ingredients in lecathin. I never heard of it for Alzheimer's but I would love to know more about it. If I find any interesting articles, I'll post them here. Blessings!


 I would also be interested in seeing if it does help with dementia.......God Bless........Lyn


 Hi Lynn, how are you doing? Are you coping ok? Yes Rosie thats right, National health system or service. I have heard both terms used. I am not sure which is correct but it amounts to the same thing in the end, Waiting LOL.


 Any word on the lecathin.......God Bless....Lyn


 Hello Lyn and Rosie. I am sorry that I have not posted in a long time. My sisters apointment was supposed to be last Tuesday the 25th. Unfortunaly we had to cancel it because my sister has been quite poorly and in pain due to a bad case of constipation. We have been told that the Doctor will arrange for another apointment but that he will come out to the house. Of course because of this we still dont know the results of the MRI scan and I was not able to ask about the lecathin. On the Tuesday morning my brother in law phoned me in a panic, and myself and one of my other sisters raced around to the house and while I dealt with the phone calls(Doctor nurse etc) my other sister bathed and comforted her. Although I hate to say it,I am of the opinion that my sister now needs more care than her husband can cope with giving her.My sister has started to wander into the next room and before you can bat an eye she has spread feaces everywhere. My brother in law just doesnt seem to see the signs that she needs the bathroom. He shouts at her and treats her as a child. it can be very upsetting. My self and my other 2 sisters do what we can to help but she needs more than we can give when we all have our own familys and problems to deal with. I will update you when I can. I hope that you are both coping ok.


 Gald to see you again .........Rosie had checked into the soya and there is conflicting info about it ......I am gald your sis is back on the Aricept ........Keep posting we miss you ..........God Bless....Lyn


 I have heard bits about this and I will check into it for you ...........glad you making sure Doc agres with it first though ......I will check into this for you after I get back from seeing Mom........Take care and God Bless........Lyn


 Hi Rosie We dont see the consultant until the 25th. We get the results of the scan then too. I will come back here and let you know what he says. If you are wondering why it is such a long time until the apointment, This is England, NHS, and waiting is what we do alot of unfortunatly.


 Thanks Bag Lady, that really helps us put our short waits in perspective. NHS is National Health System??? Blessings!


 Hi hun I am doing better but have my days you know ,How are you doing ?? Post and let me know what you are up to ....Lots of good vibes and Prayer's coming your way.....God Bless and let us know about the lecathin.......Wild that an ingredient in dog food eh ......be well ......Lyn


 Conflicting info Lyn. I think this is another healthy thing that doesn't get a big studies because there is no big drug company to pay for it.


 We didnt get to ask about the lecethin because she has now been put back on the Aricept.I was surprised how easy it was for us to get her back on it,I had been told that once it was stopped that it would be very difficult for the Doctors to agree to her having it again. All it took was one email from me to the nurse and bingo they gave her the Aricept again. I feel annoyed though that we are still waiting to see the consultant. He promised to come out to the house after what happened with the last apointment(see above post) I have asked more than once if we will get an apointment soon but we are still waiting. I will be seeing the nurse tomorrow at my sisters house so I am going to ask again. We still havent been given the results of the MRI that my sister had months ago. On a happier note my sister has been brighter and more talkative(although not much) since going back on the Aricept. Unfortunatly though she is now having to wear diapers at home and when out of the house. For a person of 56 its not nice but at least she doesnt seem to be bothered by it at all,infact she now seems oblivious as to when and why she needs to use the toilet.

How young can you get Alzheimers?,"Hi, all. I recently have become concerned that my younger sister (51) may have Alzheimers. She is constantly losing her house keys and ends up staying in hotels because she cannot get in her house. She is three to four hours late, even though calls to her when she is only a little late results in ""I'll be leaving pretty soon."" SHe has had services like phone and electric cut off because she doesn't pay her bills. She is a hoarder and her house has become uninhabitable. She is touchy and easily irritated. She has convinced her doctor that she is ADD and is on medication for that. I was recently out of town and got a call from her asking if she could hang out at my house. (I thought she meant for a couple of hours to use my computer.) She ended up staying for ten days. This meant that our elderly cat who is deathly afraid of her dog was left outside without food or water for a week. She seemed unaware of this. In the past, she would have cared now it is not even a blip on the radar. When we returned home, she had taken a floor lamp and put it on top of the computer tower. She seemed to think that was a neat idea even though it was very unstable and served no purpose. A couple of days later she showed up at our house unannounced asking to use the computer to send an email to a co-worker and her boss. She was angry about something. When she asked me to read it before sending it, the last line said something about don't be surprised if this makes me go postal. I was appalled! She had no idea that it would be perceived as a physical threat against her fellow workers and could be grounds for termination. She has lost most of her friends, those she hasn't lost are in contact with me and are very concerned. She is driving us all crazy with her inappropriateness and lateness. She does not honor any boundaries any longer. She seems unaware of them. She has been my touchstone throughout my life and I always could count on her. Now I don't even know her. cherylln","Dear Cheryll, I wouldn't normally visit the Alzheimer's Board but when I saw the topic of your post 'How young can you get Alzheimer's' I found myself drawn to it. Cheryll, I know you post on the Lyme forum, but I didn't see any post from you about your sister over there. I hope you don't mind me asking if you have considered the possibility that your sister has Lyme? The fact that she is still so young and is displaying this kind of erratic behavior ... her lateness, the ADD, emotional instability and rage. I do know of a lady here in Missouri who was almost hospitalized for Alzheimer's before finally being diagnosed with Lyme. Don't want to push anything on you and your sis, just wanted to suggest ruling out Lyme. Take care Cheryll!


 Thank you, Lyn and Graceann, I have considered Lyme as the culprit. I posted here because I don't know all that much about Alzheimer and have been wondering. There are many conditions that mimic each other... I have opened the door with her that maybe her ""ADD"" and fibromyalgia may be in fact Lyme and she seemed open to that idea. I know that neuroborreliosis (neurological Lyme) and Alzheimer have a lot in common. I appreciate your concern and comments and ideas. I have been losing precious sleep over this, which I need because I myself am sick with Lyme. Much appreciation, Cheryll N


 There is a woman who I know that has Lwey bodies disease,similar to AD,she was diagnosed at age 38 with AD at first but has recently been dx with Lewy Bodies.AD can strike at any age.


 Hi cherylln. I am sorry to hear about your sister,it seems like she is having a realy tough time of things. And of course the knock on effect is that her problems are effecting you too. My sister was diagnosed with early dementia at the age of 52(she is 57 now) but she had been having problems for quite a while before that. She would order a taxi to take her shopping and when it arrived she would have forgotten that she ordered it. I only found this out by chance recently because I happened to speak with the taxi driver who new our family well from years ago. There is no doubt from what you have told us that your sister has a problem,but as to if its due to dementia or not only a Doctor will know for sure. Make the apointment for her and go with her,that way you can tell the Doctor everything that has been happening. Please come back and let us know how you both get on.


 bump.......how are you doing


 Cherylln I would really seriously think of gettting her to her docs and telling him that all these things are going on if need be keep a log book on what is going on sounds to me as she may have some demetia happening and I am sure she is afraid as well.....you said he has her on meds for ADD what are they may I ask ? .....if you want to talk my email addy is there It is so sad and horrid what this disease can do to those we love and I am sure this is eating you up you need some peeps to be able to understand your position and the feelings you are going thru........ I am here and do relate I just lost mom 6 months ago and my step dad is also suffering with this Disease........God bless and get in touch please........ Either here on boards or in an email ......Lyn


 Thanks for that input I never knew about the lymes ........ I bumped some threads for you to have a look at a test is quite easliy done to determine ad........


 I hope you get this figured out and so sorry about you and your condition as well .......If you get really stressed out which I imagine you do visit us on the Anxiety /Panic forum as well ......God Bless


 Thanks Snowy I was hoping you would post ....How are you and Larry doing


 Hoping things are going better and you have gotten an appointment for her Hope you are feeling better as well Again pop over to A/P when things get to stressful for you


 I am hoping we hear from you soon have had you in my thoughts and prayers"
mother-in-law,"Hi, I am new to this forum. I am basically looking for a support group because there are none where I live. My mother-in-law has Alzheimers Disease. She is driving me crazy. She lives very close to me and my husband. She comes over every day. When she is confused she stays for hours. She stays for lunch. She usually does this when my husband is at work. She is so bored. I do not think she can read a long book anymore. I know she can not cook and I am beginning to think she can't run a microwave. I think she is in the moderate stages of the disease. She started taking Aricept 2 weeks ago. I have seen improvement in her symptoms but I know it can't fix her and it probably can not give her back what is lost. (like her ability to add and subtract.) I have questions , but I know they are unanswerable. How long does she have? (before we have to think of serious care for her.) And what on Earth do I do to entertain her? I am ashamed to admit I have just told her to go away sometimes. There is alot I would like to say, but I myself lose interest in long posts. So thanks for listening.","Hi Lyn, thanks for writing back .....makes me feel welcome. not many resources in this town. But I am looking into someone coming in a couple hours a week to cook and do some of the more strenuous housework. (she also has arthritis, she is 70) There is this crazy thing about not telling them they have AD so I have just asked her if it is OK to have some one come in and help with housework. She has mentioned the aricept TV commercial and alzheimers but hasn't flat out asked me if she has it. I guess no good can come from telling her she has it and frankly she would probably forget I said it anyway. I don't know for sure that we won't be taking her in. Mother and son (my husband) are very close and we have always lived near her. (20 years) The problem I have is she has always been extremely critical and overbearing with me. (and everybody else too) And now she seems to have coveinately forgotten all of that and relies heavily on me for just about everything. I do her checkbook , give her rides, help her pay bills, feed her lunch and more. I can not help but feel this is a test from above. My husband is in complete denial of his Mother's condition. I know this is very painful for him. He has asked me to return to work. I have been a stay-at -home mom for the last two years. I have 1 child that I had late in life. He thinks his Mom can babysit while I go back to work. You don't have to tell me that I can not let this happen. I do know about AD, I worked in a Alz. unit for a few years. It is just that all my Alz. training has seemed to go out the window because I am so close to the situation. And I am learning so much that my training didn't teach me. Like she can be almost normal one day and seem incapable of anything the next. It is so frustrating. I have defiately talked enough. But I want to thank you for the word ""habit"" I had forgotten how important a routine is to her. Maybe I can revise her schedule (she carries a day planner with her at all times) to get myself a little more free time. I love my mother-in -law because she has been part of my life for so long and she is not all bad, there are just days that I want to move out of the state.

 Been busy. Things have been quiet, I believe thanks to aricept. We do have a lot in common. I hate to say it but when things get rough I'll be looking to talk to you. Thanks again...........Inert


 Inert ....Welcome I am not one that loses interest in long posts so post away ......... I am sorry you are dealing with this .....she is constantly coming to your house right is there a home care place in your area that can come in to her house and spend time with her or a respite care facility where she can go and do some things with peeps here age like cards or whatever? Talk to her Doctor..... It sounds like you and her son wont be taking her in when she gets to that point,,,,,,I dont think it is easy to say how long she has My mom ( Bless her soul) lived with this for yrs and I know many others that have as well ..... I looked after her and now am looking after my Dad who is also with this DD....... I take him out fishing and to Market but I dont have lil ones at home anymore ( I have a Teen)........anyways so I am able to do things with him plus I worked in this field for yrs so I am more used to this I guess....... Does your hubby have anything to do with her or help out with her at all ,or is it just you ....... There is resources at side in yellow and also Alzinfo .com that you may want to check out ........we have alot of members here and I am hoping some will come post for you ..... The aricept is a good med for this so maybe it will help out in a couple more weeks if she has only been on it 2 weeks now I am not sure how long it takes to fully get into system ....... You need to remember or your hubby does that now she is like the child and roles are reversed she is confused and I am sure that being at your house is what she knows most ..........HABIT...... I hope this will settle down for you and you can get some help it is a hard task but I know I wouldnt trade one minute with Mom ( lost her 7 mths ago) nor Dad ....... You cannot give her back what she has lost but new memories can be made ........ I hope this has helped .........My info is under name if you want to talk okay ........ Take care and God Bless........... Lyn


 WE have been thru the same thing it seems though it was my MOm .......I too forgot what my Nursing had taught me maybe it is is because it is to close to home ya know .............. Mom was always critical of me all my life as well and then when she started with the AD it was I no matter how sick I was (even with IV lock in) I looked after all her same things you are doing as well as her personal care and daily total care....... I can honestly feel your frustration I too had my Cait (daughter) at a late stage in life and I am not able to work now due to crohns and other illnesses but I know I would not have worked when she was small had I not had my own retirement home where she was with me .....I do not blame you at all for this decision and U need to stick to your guns ......IMO It will be hard for hubby to see his Mom like this and accept it so therfore it falls on you ...... I had Cait to help me and with my step dad she helps as well ........ I think the planner would be a great idea as well as someone coming in for a couple hrs dialy this will give you the break you need if she eventually comes to live with you's you will ahve to really open your huby's eyes and have his help with this : it is too mch for you to bear on your own with a young child ...... Also it is his blood mom and she never let him go without did she ? she was there to feed clothe and take care of him I am sure so now the roles will be reversed .. We cannot just have the Seniors and seniors with AD as a ""throw away"" group of peeps they deserve respect and dignity Please again if you have msn or aol buddy add me so we can chat some more on this you really are in need of support and I am going to be here for you okay .......As will other members on this forum.......I am here to yak to anytime OKay I am up at 430 in the am Ontario Canada time lol so if you are on we can talk...... post and vent: you need to it cannot build up inside or you will eventually start to resent her unwittingly but resent none the less......... God BLess and take care .........Hoping you will continue to post if your anxiety gets to bad pop over to the other forum I am on Anxiety /Panic and you will find great peeps there and support as well LYN

I live with my 71 year old mother in law...,"She was dxed with early Alzheimers in July 2005 but rejected the dx. Since then, her deterioration is very obvious. I just need support. I am with her more then her sons are and I am stressed to the max. Can anyone offer any tips? What can I do to help her? She is finally taking Aracept but she doesn't know what it is and why she takes it (only way since she totally will not admit to having it). Also, is hearing loss associated with the disease? She can't hear (or understand) us and it is so frustrating (because we aren't frustrated enough) and we want to try and have her hearing checked - every little bit helps. I just need people to talk to. This is SO hard! ~Marion","Thanks Lyn - I did email you - I hope I got the correct address.


 Marion I got your email sent you one back how are you today


 Lol.you will get the questions hun and you did really great with your answer I dont believe in out and out lying to them but to ""Skirt"" the answer and issue is okay .....

 Bump


 I dont think Hearing loss is a given with AD and I am sorry you are having such a anxious time .I found that yes it was frustrating at times with Mom but I knew what she had and I could not let her look after herserlf ya know ......AD is a horrid disease that robs them of all their memories and thoughts of the past and ability to make new memories take away their ability to...... recognise their own children , grandchildren ......Marion you sound so frustrated hun please EMAIL me and I will talk to you and try to help you cope with this okay .I am here for you please dont feel you are all alone anymore ,I do know just what you are going thru I lost mom and now I look after my dad ..please get in touch okay I am here for you .........God Bless......LynYOu will find email under my mane as is the IM


 OOPS nope It is Lynhowlyncat @aol.com .....hope to hear from you soon Marion....Take care and God Bless


 Rough, of course.... I told her that doing her laundry was no biggie - I have 2 kids so I am always doing laundry anyway. Well - she asked if she had shorts...I was like ""Ummm - yeah you wore shorts yesterday"" whcih baffled her and then she asled what was up with what she was wearing today (which was a casual summer skirt) so I told her she was wearing a skirt to which she replied : ""Oh I don't think they had those in my day"" OMG - how do you ANSWER that? I laughed and said that skirts came bofore shorts so she was AOK. UGH! Thanks for checking. I totally need support and a some shoulders to cry on. My husband is just nasty to her - I try to be the peacemaker but I am so emotionally drained.


 How are ya today Marion hoping things are going as well as they possibly can if you get a moment read 'Padraigs"" story ....Thinking of you .......Lyn


 Marion......Havent heard from you wondering how things are"
Mom ......... First Christmas and Year Without You........,Am spending Christmas here with Howie and Cait Dad the next day will be with us I really am missing you....... It has been hard so dang hard mom Loving you and missing you .,"Lyn: I'm so sorry for the loss of your mom. I can't imagine the loss you must feel, especially during the holidays. I hope you know she is up there looking out for you!


 lyn sending you some scottish hugs, to help you get through this!!! i know how hard it is, i feel the same way about Dad!!!! it's been 4 years now, but it doesn't make it any easier!!!! you will get through this,and you have all of us here supporting you take care sandra xxxx


 Mom used your recipe for the wonderful dinner rolls you always made I think I did them right ............Miss you Love Lyn


 I have my adopted daughter here from the USA and we watched your video together You would have loved her instantly MOm Love you Lyn


 Thanks so much for your post I sure do feel your loss too Yes I am keeping good things in my heart and head it is the only way I can carry on w/o her We have not been that long w/o our mom's so it is very hard at times and Christmas was the worst too for me She always loved that holiday and decorations I now look after my step dad who is going down hill and I know in my heart it wont be long either He does miss Mom so much sometimes calls me Judy by accident or perhaps because I do look like her ...... Keep well Habs and again thanks I am glad you shared with me and it does help to have the support from you I hope you will know I am here for you too Take care Lyn


 MOm I know you are looking down on me and I know you will not be here for my BD but I can still hear your voice so clearly calling me at 6 in the morning ........... especially on that day and saying ""Happy Birthday you ole _ _ _"" It makes me smile I miss you so much as you know I talk to you all the time and I believe you are answering me and no Mom I am not losing it Love you sooooooooooo


 Lyn...sorry I have been hit and miss on the site lately. Things are OK here. I had a tough discussion with my Moms best friend after Christmas. She was a sort of role model for me growing up and I have been avoiding talking to her since Mom passed. She is a big reminder. The hardest part is she really wants to talk about Mom and I have a hard time doing that with her without getting very sloppy. The other tough thing is she is not far behind Mom---she is a bit older, but less medical issues than Mom. I just got a thank you note from her that made it even harder Mom's birthday was right before Christmas and she would have been 80. I know that to some that is a ripe old age, but I was born when she was 40 so our time together still was not as long as it could have been It's also been tough lately because Dad has stirred up a controversy. He has a girlfriend and likely had her before Mom passed. None of the 6 kids has met her, but I hear she is about MY AGE. We think she is using Dad and now I have to watch out from 90miles away for Dad's interests. Mom was so sick and they struggled the last two year, but he really messed up on this one---he wanted to bring this woman to the family only service for Mom. I am getting ready to possibly meet this ""woman"" this weekend for Dad's birthday and I hope I can keep it together. Thanks for checking in on me. Keep me up to date on how you are doing. Remember to keep the positive memories in full view


 Habs Please know I will be with you in Spirit this weekend when is your dads BD mine is today lol the big ole 53 and counting mom passed away at 65 totally uncalled for ( had me at very young age) My sister in all her wisdom decided to pull down 40 yr old wallpaper and paint whilst mom laid on couch with a touch of pneumonia and she had emphysema as well .Of course she got sicker and died in a few days THIS was the only thing my sis did for her at all I will alwyas hold her accountable ..........I know I should be able to forgive but I cannot not yet I just cant ...... Be well hun and know I really know what you are going thru Luvs Lyn


 Wow Lyn are we connected! My Dad's BDay is 1/13 also. I always said 13 was my lucky number (Dads Bday, Mom 12/13, good outcome surgeries on the 13th). The sis issue is a tough one. I can onlytell you to try and forgive a little everyday. I am trying to get past Dad inviting his other women friend by just letting a little go each day. But I must admit she will suffer my wrath if she is using him. I am going to have to let the history go or it eats me up inside and keeps me awake at night. I still have not been able to meet the women....we couldn't go see Dad as my husband had a car accident Saturday. Just when you think things are getting easier....well he is OK and everything else can be replaced.


 Worrier Thanks for that great input ' YES all hug your mom and your loved ones let them know you do love them No matter what as worrier said and Habs and I know first hand there just might not be another time to do so Again Worrier fantabulous and so true input 'You take care hoping things get "" fixed "" with you n yor mom real soon Keep us posted plz Luvs Lyn

 Mom I sat in my chair early yesterday morning Tree lights flashing and decorations all looking good I felt this tug at my heart and tears on my face ......... I know you wont be here this year With me in body ,but in Spirit for sure I hurt like hades everytime I think of you I miss you ,hearing your voice Your laugh and yes even the griping at dad lol I have never had a Christmas without you so this is all new to me and I need to find a way to have me get thru it it seems harder each day Nothing is the same No family ""get togethers' ...they have all gone their way I wish it wasnt this way Mom But I know now that you Just could not stay and face another day Of pain and sadness for not remembering and drifting away ......... A few tears fell down of course as I knew I had to get off my rear as you woulld say and "" get it done "" For Cait and Howie,Dad and self The tears will still come but I know that is normal and I also know that you will be here with me in Spitit Everyday for the rest of my Life You left quite the legacy with your ways and your love I know you are watching me constantly Yes I know from"" Up Above"" Mom ...... I love and miss you so much I hung a "" Special "" ornament in memory of you I will take a few minutes Christmas Morning and talk to you Like I usually do I miss that more than anything and I will continue this Til I am beside you ""Up There"" and can talk to you In person once again and share a laugh or two Loving and missing you all the days I am More so now as the Favorite time of yours draws near I know you will be watching from up above Wishing us hope happiness and love Love and miss you Mom so much Your Loving daughter Lyn

 Mooney thanks so much you brought tears to my eyes I apprecaite your caring and kind words more than you know Yes I have lost so many loved ones in past hubby's, a child at 6 yrs of age, and grama almost 2 yrs to the day Mom passed in March ......... I think it was harder as well as my first hubby was killed on St Paddy's day 17th) and Mom was gone at 6 am on the 20 th of March ..........27 yrs later ...........it all flooded back ya know and this is my first one w/o Mom so .......... I have told Cait(daughter) that they ( her dad was sec hubby) are all looking down on us and watching all we do and that they are proud of her for her work and all her accomplishments so far I know Mom would be beaming knowing Cait was selected to be a Page at the Ontario Legislative BLDGS due to her marks and community involment Mom was right into the labor laws and all of that when she was well and worked nursing til got beat up by an orderly wanting drug cart Keys .............then in the last few yrs she developed emphysema and Alzheimers ..........I know she is in a better place but that doesnt stop the hurt ya know ** Thanks for letting me get this out Mooney I needed that so much Happy Holidays and a better 2007 for us all God Bless Lyn


 My sweet sweet friend Thanks so much I am so happy you posted Yes it is hard but together we can and will get thru it You have been such a friend and support to me Thank you for being here Luvs ya God Bless Lyn


 I sat and watched your video showing all or some of your life with me and the other kids as well as babes yesterday ..........It was the best thing I could have done .A peace finally came over me Love you Mom Lyn


 Lyn...just visiting from the Cd board as I saw your post subject. Please know that my thoughts are with you. I had my first Christmas without Mom this year also. Mom passed in March and it has been a strange mix of feelings and thoughts since. Recognizing all the things Mom gave you in her lifetime--and I mean the memories and not the physical things--is a fantastic way to remember her. I had a hard time watching my mother in law spend Christmas with her great grandchild when my mother never met her second great grandchild who came to this Christmas---but I remembered Moms way of making christmas fun when we were little. I brought lemons and candy cane straws for everyone to try becuase Mom always had that treat for us--I made hot cocoa and toast (even though my tummy no longer likes it) and hung her favorite ornament on my tree. Keep remembering the happiness of Mom and she will live forever for both of us.


 How are you making out Habs Lyn


 Up alot in the night I dont want a birthday w/o you You gave me life so now you are gone why celebrate it Love ya


 Hockey Fan, good luck meeting this other 'woman'. it takes a really strong person to do so - i don't know if i'd be able to, but then again, i have never been in that situation. Lyn, my heart goes out to you both. I still have my mom, and i have to admit, the past week or so, i have no been very nice to her at all. we have both been at each other's throats but i know my attitude hasn't been the greatest. i am at my desk at work right now crying reading your posts, thinking 'what would i do without her?' i could kick myself for the way i've been to her. you never know when life can end, and seeing everything you wrote, i've realized how much i should treasure every moment i have with her. i'm sorry for the hurt you are going through. lots of hugs to you


 Worrier I know that since I lost hubby in 79 and my last words to him "" if anything happens dont bother calling me "" he was dead 15 minutes later ............I never got the chance to tell him I loved him I b** ched him out I have lived with that guilt since and always will I now make sure I say I love you have a great day to hubby and daughter prior to them going out door as you NEVER know when you will see them again and are blessed each time they walk thru this has alot to do with my a/p Yes please go and give your mom a hug hum please Once she is gone life changes so much it is not able to be put into words ...... Thanks for your suport and caring words Luvs Lyn

 THanks sis I have been missing our cup o tea....... Drinking it now and loving it so Luvs God Bless Sis"
my sister in law needs help!!!,"hey guys, not sure if anyone here can give me any advice, but thought i would try any way!! my sister in law has had awful problems with her mum for many years!!! she seems to have some sort of personality disorder, sounds like it could be Histrionic Personality Disorder??. any way i am looking for any advice you guys may have, if you have come across any thing like this?? she is at her wit's end, her mum is just so out of control, she never gets a minutes peace from her, she either phones constantly or turns up at her door and just gives her constant abuse!! hope you guys can help sandra xxx","there is snowy, but they aren't being much help!! they can't do anything for her, she refuses meds, and refuses to believe there is a problem!! at one point they thought she had dementia, but then changed her mind, my poor sis in law doesn't know what to do, she threatens her on the phone and turns up at her house and starts shouting abuse at her. She trys to ignore her mum, but that just makes things worse, she just makes things up about SIL and her family!! all the docs keep saying is that it is just her personality and they can't do anything about it sandra Post Edited (mrs mac) : 8/30/2006 2:45:34 PM (GMT-6)


 Just a thought but I wonder if she could be bipolar.


 lyn the only thing she has been told to do is contact the police every time she turns up at her door, and that isn't going about things properly, and not really helping the situation at all!! she has been assessed before, but they can't find anything wrong with her and just keep telling sil it's her personality, and just the way she is!!! my poor sil is going to end up having a nervous breakdown, her latest stunt was just completely out of this world, and it was all because my SIL refused to have anything more to do with her the drs really aren't being much help, and because she doesn't seem to be mentally ill, they can't section her or force her to have any more assessments done on her. All the support networks in the UK are geared toward the person who is mentally ill, there is not apparent support network for the families who so need it, i want to do something to help, but don't even know where to start sandra xxx


 she certainly does ellie!!! they have talked about a restraining order, but to be honest her mum wouldn't care, hopefully if she has to call the police out all the time, then maybe they can get the ball moving on something being done about it you are so right, she shouldn't have to put up with it, and neither should her husband and kids!!! sandra xx


 I agree,get a restraining order & make it stick!!


 thanks lyn, i know she has phoned Saneline, and they seem to be giving her some advice and support, i just want to be able to help her, but not staying near her any more, makes it really difficult, that's why i thought i would post here, to see if you guys had any ideas i could pass on to her!!! i don't think she would come on here to be honest, she doesn't really go on the computer much at home, but i will pass on any thoughts you guys may have!!! thank you so much sandra xxx


 Bump


 Is there not a Dr.involved??She needs one.


 Does anyone have POA?


 Good thought there..........and someone has to DEMAND the doctor's do something it is not right what your sil is going thru not to mention how your mum must really feel she has to be afraid although she is yelling and abusive ya know what I mean .......I am not condoning what she is doing but somewhere someone and hopefully a trained professional will step in As posted by Snowy is there a POA........There are resources in yellow at side maybe something there to help as well ...sorry for all you are going thru your family is in my thoughts and prayers.......God Bless.........Lyn


 Hmmm, and they've ruled out bipolar? If this is truly just this womans personality, and your SIL has done all that she can. Perhaps it's time for her to start thinking of herself and get a restraining order. I know it sounds dramatic, but it might give old mom the message that she is finished taking the abuse. Abusive parents don't necessarily end the abuse just because the children have grown. It simply changes and they often use guilt afterwards to keep us on that chain. Somebody's got to break the link somewhere, be it mental health treatment, or the police, or perhaps another family member. Your SIL deserves a life without fear and abuse. Ellie


 I really believe it is time for tough love .....My mom had a way of pulling on my guilt strings we (Cait and I ) did all for her none of the other siblings did a thing except take money and us her credit cards and credit rating which was excellent .......I always was close to MOm but she played me kinda like a fine violin,.....and Cait My doctor told me that Mom actually could cause me to be sick and he was right the stress would cause me to break out in sores and crohns to act up ........I never hesitated nor did cait to do anything for her.... I loved Mom dearly and do not regret taking care of her but I do not feel she did what your SIL mom is doing to her .......It has to stop and I think that Elie is totally right on this whole thing .........Your Sil can and will suffer permanent damage ...will she come here to talk to us and have our support as well as the families support and concern?? I hope you ask her and let her know we are here to help if we can ....I feel so useless in this situation and I wish I could do more for her and all of you ......God Bless........Lyn


 Thanks snowy for your input.......


 There is a book the 36 hr day I hace read it over and over it is a good book IMO.......maybe she could borrow from the library..........It is or was expensive if she has not got the funds I can and will LEND it to her and you to read .......Let me know and if its a yes I will send it to u........take care hun love and prayers coming your way and hers as well........Alzinfo.Org has a good lot of info in there as well it is in the HW resources at the yellow bar at side"

 Hi you lovley people, What can I say I'm overwhelmed. I have just seen your posts you bring tears to my eyes. Lyn I think you will understand when I say I have had to keep my distance, once released from Inistitutions, for fear of saying or doing the wrong thing. Simple things most people take for granted I will or can never experience. What's it like to go to school with other boys and girls, then go home to a Mom and Dad? Whats it like having birthday parties and presents and what about Christmas. I have lived these dreams through our children and grand children. For most of my life I blotted my formative years from my mind they never happened. Not until recent years when the Irish Goverenment issued a public apology for the abuses committed against children of that period in their 'care'. Last year Dublin University sent two people over to interview me to discover why I had not turned to a life of crime as more than 90% of those kids landed up in prison. When asked: ""Were you told you were no good, and no one wanted you?"" I replied: ""You don't have to be told, like the kid whos parents send him out for an ice cream, when he returned he finds a Sold sign at the house, and they have moved on."" A small example of what I had to deal with: Jean and I met friends of hers in town they started talking about childhood days. A woman asked: ""Do you remember when your Mom would make you etc"" I was trying to stay out of it but she kept insisting: ""Come on you must remember?"" what could I say? ""Sorry I didn't have parents"" Result silence. Anyway a deep thanks to you all. May your god go with you. Padraig


 Hi there! Congratulations! Im so happy for you! 51 years and going that is wonderful. You must be so happy together, and im happy that there are ppl that love each other that much still and i think you are wonderful for it.

You sound like two very special people to me and I hope you have a wonderful time and much joy together still to come. Rosie x


 It pains me to know that you lived this way and yet to be the warm and loving man you are is such a life acheivement ..........I know I am sincerely so proud of you as my friend my mentor ......my adopted grandpa .......The stories you share give us a wake up for what we had in our lives I know it certainly does for me and if I start to fel sorry for self I always think of you and what you went thru as a child and later as a young man You are so special God sure broke the mold when he created you my loving friend ..........

God Bless you G Padraig and G Jean Love to you both and many more yrs to come together Lyn


 Thanks sis ........they are both very special to me ........"
Problems with balance for mom,My mom has alzheimers and has been on a steady decline.... She still gets around though and i take her out and take her shopping etc. Lately (last few days) she does this weird thing where her body tilts backwards when she walks and i'm worried she'll fall. Its like when you have a child by the hand and are trying to drag them along and their body goes backwards to resist.... thats how she walks sometimes. She has fallen a couple times in the past (one time she missed the chair and she fell a couple days ago but not sure how). So i've been trying to follow her around the house and my dad has been trying to keep an eye on her too but i'm so worried she'll fall in an instant when no one is watching her. I don't have help yet (thats another issue on which i want to ask for advice...... how to get a home health careworker and what the costs are as i can't afford too much :() If anyone has any thoughts on how to help with her balance..... i'd appreciate it Thanks in advance to all.,"Aricept. She also takes Lipitor for cholestrol and quinapril for blood pressure. I've been giving her some melatonin to help her sleep at night and shes been on that for several months now and she does well on it. She tends to get shaky etc after a fall i've noticed..... not just for a little bit but it can last for a few days. I wonder if this has something to do with her falling..... I don't know. She's going to go see her doc again as i'm trying to schedule an appt now. I just don't know how much they can do with the balace issue. I wish she would carry her cane or maybe a walker. I'm looking right now to see if they make ""children's walkers"" lol..... just something smaller cause my mom is tiny. Even if i find her a walker though she will forget to use it some of the time.


 What medications is she on?


 It may be one of man problems she is dealing with. I truly think a total going over by family Doctor is in order in case she has an ear infection( would / could throw Eqilibrium off ) I believe she is scared hence the shaking after the falls . More recently you said she fell backwards hurting her back.......this could have done some serious damage to her spine or coxic As for the eating perhaps many small portions thru out the day would help out with this okay Really I believe a Doc's visit is most essential right now Yes I know here in Canada a Home care support Worker would be gotten in thru the doc's referral I know of many here that have some in 3 to 5 hrs per day that comes im 7 days weekly Also talk to the doc about this whilst there I hope you get some help and your Mom Please post and let us know how things go Okay Take care and God Bless' Lyn Keeping you n family in my thoughtas and Prayers"
Alzheimer's .......,Just read in the Alzinfo that AD has become the 7th highest cause of death amongst the American Men and Women. You can go to the resources and find the Alzinfo there and are able to get a news letter each month I do get alot of info from this ....... This is a horrid disease and robs of us of our loved ones and robs them of so darn much.......It is heartbreaking to say the least.......God Bless....Lyn,"I do go there as well Snowy not in the chat but on the message boards............got it thru here on resources.....ttyl,How are you and Larry doing?? ,,,,,,,,,God Bless


 Its a shame that the majority of AD incidence could be prevented with a healthy diet. There are a few places in the world where diet is mainly vegetables, fruit and fish... Okinawa for example, they have 75% less dementia.


 My mom ate healthy all her life as well and still had it ...... I dont know .......


 I said 75% less demntia, so not everyone would be totally protected of course. But like I said, there is one part in japan where demnta is real low, they eat 20% less calories and have maintained an excellent diet all through life. You can take a look at the website and the image I posted below: http://okinawaprogram.com/study.html or scroll down to the okinawa part on here: http://www.iangoddard.net/cr.htm


 you can also chat with others with Alzheimer's at: httpL//www.alzinfo.org/community/chatrooms 2 pm & 8 pm central time every day.............

 I ate healthy all my life....still got AD.Now I could care less if I eat...........

 Thanks Whoa for those links will have a look see Lyn"
parents live in assisted living - need advice badly,"Both of my parents are in their 80's with my mom having dementia. I don't know if she has Alzheimers or not, but since she's so happy all the time, I don't want her to have any additional testing. My dad is older than her (he just turned 89) and I just can't seem to get things through his head. Sometimes he gives blank stares, but at other times he can sit and read the NY Times. They live in an assisted living facility about 20 mins. away from my home. I cannot visit there every day since I have my own life to live and I suffer badly from anxiety and depression. Anyway, there is no social worker on site, nor any coordinator of their care. It has come to the point that when medical issues arise, they don't know what's going on, don't know to contact their doctor, etc. My dad doesn't understand what dementia really is. He just thinks my mother's problem is loss of memory, but I can't explain to him that it is so much more. He is also deaf with a hearing aid, so I don't know when he can't hear me or when he doesn't grasp what I am saying and what it means. The executive director is the main person in the operation of this assisted living. There is no law in the State of NJ that requires any assisted living to have a social worker on site, but what is more frightening is that there is no social worker even on the outside to confer with regarding my parents. I don't have any money to help them, but my parents are covered by AARP & Medicare. How can I go about getting a social worker or someone in a similar position to either help me directly or guide me along on a path leading to someone else who can help me. Do any of you have any ideas or suggestions? I'd appreciate any replies. Thank you!!","Forget that - nursing home - duh! What you are saying is not always the case. My mother can stay there and go into the ""memory unit"" if need be. She is only in the beginning stages of dementia at this time, although I do know that it can progress quickly. Right now, I am taking one day at a time.

 I doubt that you can,as their rules are much different that a Nursing Home.If she progresses to a certain point she will need a NH as they are not equipt to deal with dementia.


 HI there and Welcome I am in Canada and here the Assissted Living Units do have everything on site .I would call around to some more gov agencyies such as the Alzheimers Society of your State and Social Services Welcome to HW an di am so sorry for all that is going on I looked after mom till she passed this yr and now look after my step dad who is going downhill fast .Try the resources at the side as well in yellow and Alzinfo .Com .Maybe someone can give you a bit of help and point you in right direction Post and let me know how you make out okay ......

DOES MY DAD HAVE ALZHEIMERS?,My dad is 80 years old and refuses to go to a doctor. For a number of years if he can't remember something it keeps him up all night walking the floor. He can be trying to remember something of no importance such as the name of an actor or name brand of a watch ect. He will spend all night searching books for the answer and walking around the house. He says he has to be moving and can't lie in bed. These attacks only happen at night and have been happening for about ten years. They have become more frequent and intense over the last year.I have done reseach on panic attacks and the length of his anxiety doesn't fit the symptoms. Does anyone have loved ones with Alzheimers that experience similar symptoms? Thank you in advance for your help.,"Hoping you get this post and come back for support Lyn


 Hi and Welcome to HW . Does your dad have any other things hes does like becoming aggitated easily , angry or other character differencs that you have noticed???? I ask you this Sadie as I too will do what your dad does but not for as long I will keep trying to remember a name or something but again like I said not for the length he does ....... Is he living at is own house ,where is your mom ? There are so m,any more things I would need to begin to even consider whether he may have Ad or not .Also it would be a guess based on personal experience and my Nursinfg background my Mom had AD but passed away 8 mths ago My step dad has it and I am looking after him There are resources in yellow at the side which may help you as well but please do post again I will always answer I am up in the mornings early as you can see Hoping you have a good day and that I hear from you again God Bless Lyn

My 61-year-old mom faces early alzheimers and has OCD,"I am trying to come to terms with my wonderful mother's sudden onset of apparent early alzheimer's disease and would like to hear some advice from a) others with a friend or relative who has been diagnosed this young, b) people who know something about co-occuring alzheimers and OCD. Mom has always had OCD but would never admit it, but since the alzheimer's symptoms, her OCD is getting worse! She refused to hug her best friend of 35 years this week whom she only sees a couple times a year because she had just taken a shower and her friend had been camping. She could not see how this was hurtful to her friend who feels my mom's personality is becomming more flat and elderly. Her decline is quite upsetting to all who know and love her but my mom is in total denial about it and seems happy as a lark. I guess that should make us glad but we feel alone in our grief which feels even more painful. I feel like our relationship is becomming more shallow as I am told you aren't supposed to say, ""Mom, you told me that three times already,"" or ""It scares me how much you are changing"" so we just talk behind her back and hope she isn't around to hear because she thinks she's fine. This is all new to me and we are early in the diagnoses stage, so any suggestions would be much appreciated. She got her Master's degree just two years ago and graduated with honors and now her brain has been failing her in different ways for the past 9 months or so which we are still just stunned by. My dad's heart aches as he anticipates a retirement very different from the one he envisioned. This is not a club I wanted to be a part of, but thank you for any thoughts! Blessings...","Welcome ...I went thru this with my Mom (passed away 6 months ago) and now going thru it with Step dad..........It is heartbreaking to say the least You need to have her properly Dx by a doctor and then she can be treated.........

You can find it at the following URL: http://www.news-medical.net/?id=18892 God bless and stay well, Maddi","Hi Lynn, I am doing OK right now! My Crohn's Disease seems to be in remission, but my Chronic Pancreatitis keeps trying to rear its ugly head! When that happens, I have a hard time keeping my blood sugar level. It generally soars and we just can't keep it down. When I read that article, it kind of gave me a bad jolt. It surely made me want to keep my blood sugar DOWN! How are you doing?

 I'm glad you are good! Keep enjoying life as you do! I enjoy you and your posts! I have been feeling sick lately (my Chronic Pancreatitis) and have had some bad times in the ER these last few days. I wasn't able to sleep last night because of having slept too much before (IV pain meds and nausea meds which tend to enhance the pain meds), so I will probably soon fall to sleep for the day! Boy! Now my body's clock will be all turned around! God bless and stay well, Maddi

 Hi Lyn. I want to say that I am thinking of you and your struggle with the letter writing and everything.

I remember when my dad died, it came to Fathers Day that same year, and i knew i just had to buy him a card!!!! i never did write anything in it, but knew all the same that i had to buy it for him, it did help a bit!!! what i am trying to say is, we do what we have to for our own coping mechanisms, there is no right or wrong way to do it, everyones is different from our own!!!! you deal with it whatever way you feel comfortable with, and just remember we are all here with you every step of the way sandra xxxxx

mother with AD is very mean,"My mother abused me when I was a child. Actually she beat the snot out of me almost every day, until I was old enough to learn to hide until she gone or asleep. Now she is in end stage AD and she is in a lovely private facility and I am her only child living here. But she is the meanest patient they have. She has slapped other residents, slapped the nursing staff and tried to bite them and has tried to bite me many times. Most of the residents are happy and always smiling. She never smiled anyway but she won't smile for them either. I wonder if she will get meaner as the disease progresses? She is on lots of anti-depressants and it doesn't seem to make a difference. Will it just get worse? Thank you, Megthered","Wondering how you are making out .........Have not heard from you for awhile Lyn


 Thanks Snowy for your input Lyn

 Hi there I am so sorry that your Mom has AD and the fact that she is aggressive is hard too .......sorry for all you have had to go thru .....you say end stages how bad is she right now ........sometimes the meds they give will make them worse IMO ....there hasnt been alot of research done for those wth AD and for the proper meds to help they can either have the person drugged up and not doing anything at all or not the proper meds in them .......Do you happen to know what meds she is on and sounds like she has always been like this .I am so sorry ..........Hoping to hear back from you.....I really dont know if it will get worse or not I would be hoping they would have her on something and how is the workers in the home .......I bumped up the homes for you to check is she isn one of them ....be well and God Bless......


 Do you know what medications your Mom is on?Seroquel can help in some people.If they have her on Xanax,or other Benzo medications it can make matters worse.

land given by a lovedone,"I have been given some river front land from a good friend that is in her late 70's with alzheimer's, we have been the best of friends for years now and her familey has nothing to do with her at all and we are basicly like her only family even though we are not related. I'm just wondering if there maybe a legal problem when she dose passes on that her family may fight us on this matter even though they have nothing to do with her at all?","When we did the transaction of the title change I paid her 5 dollars so that it would be a legal transaction according to the title company and in her will she gave her kids only a dollar that way they may not be able to dispute it I hope, but as long as she is alive she has full use of the land.

 Probably.


 I think you might be okay there then BUT I am not familiar with the laws where you are as long as you leave a 1.00 to your relatves here nothing they can do..... I wish you all the best and as long as it is proven she was in her right state of mind as well I would assume Lyn"
How an MD Killed My Mother,"I know what you are going through...I'd taken care of my Mother also. She was a vibrant woman at 72 - rode her bike every day - did volunteer work at the local hospital. I spoke with her daily and she the epitome of health and life. I'd lived a few hours away - was in school. She'd said she had a small bump on her temple and went to see her MD - he told her not to worry about it and gave her Prednisone with a year's worth of refills. Probably spent about 10 minutes with her, as MDs will do with senior citizens. As she took the Prednisone, she felt much, much better. Got to riding her bike 12 miles a day. Prednisone will do that. She was bubbly and energetic. One day she called her neighbor - became disoriented and confused - they called 911. They indicated she was psychotic and put her in the hospital. I drove down immediately. The prednisone caused a potassium depletion/electrolyte imbalance which caused the drug-induced psychosis. Electrolyte depletion will do that. Prednisone will do that. While she was in the hospital we asked an MD there to take a look at the little bump on her forehead (smaller than a dime). He did a biopsy. It was squamous cell carcinoma. I went with her to a follow up visit to see the MD who gave her the prednisone. We waited a couple of hours until he decided to show up, walked in and said, ""What's new""? She had radiation treatments. The squamous cell carcinoma came back (it never went away). By this time I quit school and moved down to care for her. A hole developed in one side of her face where it drained pus continually, and she would occasionally spit one of her molars out while she would eat, since her teeth fell out as well. She also had beautiful, beautiful hair. That fell out also, of course - radiation will do that. They said she needed the cancer removed from her face. This time they removed her entire eye and socket, a few of her sinuses and the right side of her face. They took a patch from her abdomen and covered where the eye used to be. We kidded her she got a free tummy tuck. She didn't want to go out much after that. It came back - it did not go away. Squamous cell will do that. We took her to chemo. It had now penetrated into the brain and throughout the lymph nodes. Two years after she was put on the prednisone, she died. I cared for her at home and we had the hospice nurses come in once a week - they were wonderful. I did file a complaint with the medical board however they determined there was no wrong doing. Medical boards will do that. Appreciate the time with your Father. After they pass away there was so much you wish you could have told them. One thing I wouldn't ask -- 'What's new'. Doctors will do that.",Welcome to HW I am so sorry for your Mom and for you Yes I do treasure each second with my dad just as I did with Mom True there is so much I want to say to Mom and tell her whats going on with her Gdaughter ( my daughter) I know she would be proud I spend much time with Dad and he will be moving in with me I saw alot of things happen while in my Nursing career in Geriatrics ...........

Downs Syndrome and Alz,"I was wondering if anyone here has any good information/links/books, etc. on working with a man who has Downs Syndrome and Alzheimer's. I believe that he is now in the later-middle stages and is having aggression issues, wandering, sundowners, confusion, constantly asks what his sister said (as though he thinks we just talked to her), and also has a pace-maker. He is quite overweight ...huge tummy and short. I have taken care of him for 3 years and he is very attached to me since the rest of his staff has changed over the years. He often doesn't want other staff to help him even though, as a supervisor, I have other duties that I need to tend to. He attends a dayservice/workshop for the mentally disabled during the day and lives in a residential home. I used to work in both areas but now I am just with him during the day. Any resources that you know of may be helpful. THANKS!! Beth","Thank you, Lyn! I looked at several things and got some good info but not specifically with Downs Syndrome, yet. I will also post if I find anything. I did find info somewhere a while ago that said that if someone with Downs gets old enough that they will most likely get Alzheimer's. Since so many live much longer now then it seems to me that caregivers will need to have some more training pertaining to Downs and Alzheimer's. Something fast and easy to read like ""Caring for Alzheimer's for Dummies"" might be nice ....since many caregivers don't really have much time to spend on reading. However, I get to read and surf the internet a lot on my 2nd job (security guard for a huge building when it is closed) so I'm looking for stuff online and books. God bless you, Beth

 I am not aware of any but have a look in resources on the side perhaps there is something there I would be interested myself I am going to check into this as well and keep you posted Lyn


 Still looking and trying to find something viable I did have a patient in my home that had both but it was not really well known about back then ( 1998) and still isnt I think as you do we need more research and info on this God Bless You as well Lyn"
Restraints,I have a question about restraints. I know restraints are supposed to be very bad. BUT my mother is falling. Six months ago she broke her wrist in a fall. A few weeks ago she broke her ankle in a fall. She cannot remember she has a cast on the ankle and so she gets up to go to the bathroom or whatever and takes a tumble. Her fall was so bad this last time that they had to call x-ray in to x-ray her head. I do not understand why they can't put seat belts in these wheel chairs for people that have problems. They use bed alarms and she removes them. They finally started getting her up at 5:00 AM and parking her in front of the nurses station. What do others think of some gentle restraints of some kind to prevent all of these serious falls. I would be a terrible mother is I did not use something to secure a child. Any ideas?? SunCitySue,"Restraints are against the law as posted above.......but if you are able to find a way to protect her by restricting her movements so she is not at such a risk for falling I would say do it .You have your mothers care at heart.In Canada they do have belts made with velcro to put around their waist in the w/c and for the table topto go in front of person.I hope you find a way to help your mom as SnowyLynne said she would rather avoid the surgery.Take Care and GOD BLESS


 bump


 The law says NO RESTRAINTS.But I think it's alot of whooie.I would rather be restained than have to have surgery to have a break repaired.


 Sue99............another thing that we are allowed by law to use here in Canada is a POSY bar....this too goes across the lap of person in w/c.............this still is not called a restraint as the person could get out if determined enough.I think you are justified in your concerns over your mother and the falling.Would you be able to talk to the Administrator or Director of Care about your concerns and ask if any of above mentioned ideas may be okay ?The seatbelt and post bar are gentle ways to ensure her safety,but again I think you have to talk with the DOC or Admin of the facility.I hope you get some answers and soon ..........God Bless and Keep Your Mom Safe From Harm"
Good News........,Possible blood test for detecting early AD .saw this on the news and I sure hope it a go ....Check your nightly news to find out more.....,"I saw that too and I have to agree with you hun who would want to know they are coming in to AD....How are ya hun.....


 I was reading about a skin test that they might be using soon too. If its somthing that is done very early on(before symptoms apear) then I am not sure if I would want the test or not. If the test was posative it would be awful because you know that you are just waiting for your symptoms to apear."
husbands dreams,"my husband asked that I post this question, he has early onset Alz. He was diagnosed about 2 years ago. He is on aricept and nemenda he is 53.

 Yea Lyn a great women with all of us here, sometimes I don't know how she dose it.

With all the fur on them they walk right though the hot wire pulling it all down and I think that it's kind of funny that when I tell them about fishing next to a big old brown bear they tend to think I'm crazy and some of the hunts I have been on and having a bear flatten my tent before.

We believe she has it too, or some form of dementia. She is still living alone in her own home, but we have a nurse that goes there M-F 1 to 3pm to make sure she has lunch and takes her pills. Then, either my sister or I go there at supper time to make sure she eats supper and takes her pills. It is getting to be more frustrating as time goes on. She is a very unhappy person, so unlike the way she used to be. Right now she is angry because we disabled her car. A doctor told her that she can't drive any more, but she doesn't remember that (or believe it). She is 81 yrs old and has been gradually getting worse starting about 6 to 8 years ago. Can't actually remember when this all started. Anyway, I could go on and on, but I just wanted to say hello. I added a Title to your thread ......this way you will get more responses..Lyn Post Edited By Moderator (Lyn Emerick(Howlyncat)) : 3/4/2006 3:52:35 PM (GMT-7)","Hi and Welcome to HW........I know that it can be very frustrating for caregivers(family) and I applaud you and your sister for looking out for her ........I take care of Mom and step Dad and I have some major health issues but I am the only family member other than hubby /daughter that will help.........I finally got homecare in 3 days a week but my mother is so angry about this and sure keeps letting me know .....lol..........I had do do this for my sanity and my health.........It is okay for her to get upset about disabling the car DO NOT feel guity at all you are no doubt saving her life/or other's.......Snowy has asked a very important question and I hoe you do come back and read theses posts........You will find a great support system here that truly know what you are dealing with ......God Bless .....Lyn BTW....In the yellow box at the side you will find plenty of great resources to help you and your sister with your mother as well........Keep us posted and stay strong .........Lyn


 Olive .........hoping to see you around again soon .........God Bless........Lyn.............Hey sis how are you doing anyways ??..........big huggs to all...........God Bless.......Lyn


 The earlier the diagnoses the better in the long run with medication.They do work.


 Is she on medication for dementia?It can help.


 Welcome to the forum Olive, Oh, how sad that you mom has AD too!! My dad has it. We really worried over the driving thing too. If you have an easy relationship with her doctor, the doc will write a ""prescript ion"" stating that your mom can't drive anymore. We blamed it on the doc. There are some real nice people here. Blessings!


 Thank you for the warm welcome. It's too bad that we're all going through this. It will be nice to have someone to talk to. My sister and I are close, in fact we work together, so we can vent on a daily basis. We have 4 brothers who all live out of state, they try to help but it is impossible for them. I look forward to reading more on this site and helping anyone that might need some support. We don't have my mom on any meds for dementia. She will be going to a neurologist in April for an evaluation. We've been putting it off. Denial, I guess....or maybe just fear. She is on antidepressants, but they don't really help. She is a fiesty lady with an Irish temper, so we have to watch ourselves. (kidding of course). Thanks again for your input. Talk to you soon.


 I totally agree with Snowy........yes it can be out of fear or denial but the quicker you know the better her quality of life( andyou and sister) will be ...........glad you will be sticking around this is a great support system...........God Bless..........Lyn"

So support groups can take some very precious time. But I really think that they would be beneficial.


 approved.


 Kelly ,.........First thank you for getting the Administrator's approval for this .......I have just lost my Mom this week and I was her caregiver.....If you would please give me a couple of days I will gladly do this for you..........Take care and God Bless........Lyn


 I will complete this for you later today .............God Bless......Lyn"
Where did my Granny go?,"My Grandmother had AD and passed a few years ago. There were not many of the large family that were willing to help out with her. I helped a good bit, I would go give my mother a break for about 4 to 6 hours a day almost every day. The last year and a half not only did she not recognize me ,I did not recognize her. The Granny I knew was so meek and would never say a foul word yet the woman I watched would call me the B word and slap me when I wouldn't let her go out the front door. Once she went in the kitchen to cook and she was cutting up bananas into a pan of water, when Iasked her what she was making she tried to stab me. We had to turn off the gas , hide all sharp objects and learn to take a slap. It would break my heart when she would sit on the front porch waiting for PawPaw to come home from work because PawPaw had died over 20 years earlier. She would get so mad at me because she wanted to cook supper for him and she couldn't use the stove.Now I have an Aunt with the same problem. I want to know if anyone knows what the chances of me getting AD are since at least 3 people (that we know of) in my Grandmas family have already been diagnosed. I have always had memory problems, since my early thirties, I was just wondering if I should prepare to one day be like Granny?","If you are that worried I would do the test that Snowy posted..........I am sorry about your grandma and now your aunt..........I just lost my Mom last week........Know you are a good soul and a kind person for helping out even when things got really difficult......This DD hurts so many and robs them of so much.......Stick around and get some support this is a great place ........God Bless........Lyn


 Thanks sis I missed that ..I am still a wee bit in a fog ya know.......God Bless....Lyn


 Denton ........still waiting to hear about what is going on .......we are looking forward to your post........God Bless.....Lyn


 You can be tested for the APOE 4 gene.It's expensive.Talk to your Dr.


 Bless your heart Denton. That had to be really hard. My dad has AD, and while he is occassionally verbally abusive, he has never acted out physically. I too worry about the possibility of one day succombing to this disease as I also have some membery problems. The best thing I saw in your post is that the incidents of AD seemed to come from only one side of your family, which would give hope that you had AD free genes from the other side. Blessings!


 Denton..hope to see you post soon ...thinking about you........God Bless......Lyn"
Wife with Dementia/Alzheimer's and hard seeing her slip away,"Welcome Rabbin First let me say it is a hard and painful journey we take watching our loved ones go down this road . I just lost mom almost 8 months ago now and the pain is still so real ........my Dad is now going down hill as well ........ MOm would get angry or frustrated very easily as do most peeps with AD if corrected or if they have somehow ""forgotton"" a person especially a family member or situation I feel it is okay to travel their road sometimes with them meaning if they say that the have seen so and so (you now this person is gone) just go along with it .....It is really trying not to hurt .IMO There are quite a few members that will also come and post to help you out with this . I read Padraigs story and converse back and forth with him ......he looks after his wife Jean alone as you do ....Maybe some questions you have could go into that thread ""Padraigs My wife My Life"" You can only do so much is there resources around for respite care or to have someone come in daily to help you out and to let you get some space?? You are the closest to her so it will be you that takes the brunt of her anger with this DD She knows something is so very wrong and she has got to be terrified as do you Yes I hear and feel your pain and rustration I hope you will continue to post here and let us help you out with his as well .Alzinfo.Org is another great place for education on this DD it is in our HW resources at the side .Do you read Rabbin? there is a fantastic book ""36 hour Day "" I recommmend this to you as well Know you are now no longer aloone in the battle ....... We will be here for you sometimes that in itself is a good start.I am in Ontario Canada my info is all at side under name to contact me if you would like Other than that again Welcome looking forward to your next post ........ You need to look after self as well ......lock medicines up if you need to .......Take care God Bless Lyn","I have a friend who took care of the love of his life,BUT they were not married.Her son(money grubber)took her away to another state & he is devistated to say the least.There is nothing he can do since they were not married. The situation is NOT good for his love now. He took care of her for 10 yrs..............


 No problem here over her assets she has less than I have and it's better for her children if I keep doing what I am doing. I pay all the bills and take her to all her doctors handle all her business affairs! I have even before the dementia set in so most of her children are glad they don't have to fool with it. They do love her dearly but have no idea how hard it is to deal with her mentally since this has taken hold of her! She was and is a great mother and grandmother to all her children any sign of them taking her out of here as described for others is not likely. But your correct people do for themselves in today's world rather than to do for others.


 The only foot print are one and they were left in knowing that as He taught of faith hope and charity. From my faith I receive His strength to endure in this world as it is! From my faith I know of and always keep my hope that He will intervene for us all, and in that is where we see one set of foot prints! And last but not least comes charity and the lesson of that is found in Luke 10 in the story of the Good Samaritan. For the world is full of those who take but few who understand giving! If it is just the giving of a kind word. For as He taught when a son asks for bread do we give him a stone. More often than not as the world is we may give food to another but put a mill stone around the neck of him who needs food! If they ask for fish often the fish appears to be more like a snake but to a hungry man a snake is not delicacy as it is for the rich but to a poor man it is a means to end or something to fill an empty stomach! For the sick who need compassion as well as medication and good treatment this is what we should always remember to give openly and freely! In knowing these things I know I can not carry myself and only hope is knowing that He is carrying me too! Again thank You Rabbin


 Rabbin How are you today


 Thanks so much will write more later need to really rest am not well God Bless and keep you's both in HIS arms


 David thank you I am doing much better I had not allowed my self to cry nor grieve the loss of my Mom only 8 mths ago now and a few other family issues were also bothering me .......well I finally went into what I call""meltdown"" I cried ,sobbed and shook so much for a few days I was afraid I had really done myself damage . However I got to the doctors and explained all that was going on and thank GOD I have a doc that is wonderful ,kind and compassionate plus a few great friends I have met here over the yrs . I gathered myself together and I realized that I NEEDED to let out those tears Mom and I were always the closest of all the other siblings and I guess I really did not want to ""believe"" she was gone I know she is with her Maker and is no longer in pain or anguish from what this disease did to her How are things going with you and Mary are there some things getting better and have you been able to read Padraigs thread yet I feel he has much to offer all of us . Have you checked out the book called the 36 Hour Day and it is a good book in my opinion Do I understand correctly you are an RN as well ?? I am a retired RN the crohns Pyoderma Gangrenosum and other illnesses made me have to give that up and it was my love my life I keep you and Mary in my prayers daily hoping things will come round for you's and that you will also have some help soon In the yellow at the side is HW resources and it too has some great places to check out one being Alzinfo.com I get the newslettter every month and it has many interesting and informative articles in it .....and many tips for caregivers as well It saddens me that 2 out of 9 of her children choose not to help out I do understand they have their own families but did Mary leave them or not be there for them Forgive me if I have overstepped I just get frustrated when loved ones are left after they have helped so much and given so much in their lives Your Mary sounds like a wonderful woman and I am so sorry she has to live in this disease it truly does rob us of them Take note that alot of research is being done and hopefully this Disease will be slowed down so others not need to pain as we and the ones stricken with it do be well my friend and yes I loved your mail it truly lifted my heart and spirits May Your God Bless You's and Keep You In His Arms Gentle huggs for Mary Take care of you as well Lyn


 David First call a Lawyer most will work on this pro bono YOU are and DO have rights as her LEGAL spouse after 2 yrs together and the fact is you have her best interest at heart Mary does not want to go and D*** I dont blame her how DARE he come into your home and tell you that you are nothing you have looked after her loved her as no one else has ........ Mary ddidnt want to go I can feel that thru your post and feel your angst over all of this The depokote is a good mood stabilizing medication and will not have her out of her mind but more in her right mind My thoughts and prayers are with you both ALWAYS I have the time for prayer:I pray she is okay and will be brought home asap to her one and only that has cared and loved her thru all this I Pray she is peaceful til she can get back to you I also Pray that your health does not get any worse with all this added stress Yes my friend I Pray whole heartedly for you both May God Keep You and Mary safe Please please keep me posted God Bless Lyn


 David my heart is breaking for you I too am in tears this is also what I feared but I didnt want to alarm you .... You need to seek out a lawyer that will help by doing this from his heart not worrying about pocket book or wallet . Mary may just be getting brainwashed as well but it sounds to me as though she loves you with all her heart soul na dbody Explain all of this in detail to a lawyer you can get a free consultation If Mary is not home tonight I would be starting a legal ball rolling she belongs with you They none of them have done a thing for her except now hurting her and basically holding her against her will You know Mary best and I would imagine you know she will probably pretend she is taking meds for them but not you know That could lead to more problems Aspirin and depokote is not compatible aspirin makes the tummy bleed a bit everytime taken You do needs to look after yourself as she will need you to be strong when she comes home Please keep in touch I am so sorry my heart thoughts and prayers are definintely out there for you and Mary for this to be over real soon God Bless You Both Lyn


 Up Date on Mary, I have attempted to contact her children in San Antonio and they well not answer phones. I got an e-mail from the daughter of where I think she is who is a strong Jehovah Witness following the Christian ways. She sent me a message saying Mary is being cared for now stop calling! All numbers have been blocked and I am being denied communications with her! My heart is breaking and I am filled with worry for her well being! David aka rabbin


 Finally was able to figure out new email thing I have just gotten I have replied okay I deleted your last entry for privacy reasons okay be well God Bless' Lyn


 Thanks Charlie, From a legal standpoint there is not much I can say or do. In the US each State has it's own laws. I am in the State of Texas in Bush country and as they jokingly say about Texas it is a different country of Good O boys! I finally got a hold of Mary and my doctors office and they were shocked by how her son the policeman had reacted in such a cold heartless manner towards her and I! It was good to talk to them this morning because the staff at that office knows all the personalities involved. And they know that Mary is one sweet lady and that her and I have had a happy good loving life of caring for one another. Our doctor is on the road and will not be back until Mon. But notes were taken and the doctor is to call me monday they prescibed some medicene for me to take to help relax me something called; Lorazepan I have not relexed or slept much in 3 days and the anixiety is over the top! And I know of and practice the same Law of Love that you do.. Nice to know that in this world of confusion caused by lack of love I am not totally alone! All the folks in here have been so kind and compassionate to me. And I know your prayers and thoughts are for Mary and family as well that God may guide everyone to do the right thing. I have nephew that showed up this morning and took me pharmacy to get the medication. Right now I am shaking a lot and very weak and I feel tired but can't sleep perhaps when this stuff takes hold I will rest and maybe this will help let my blood sugars get closer to normal ranges they have been way out of wack since this happened. The bottom line for me is if I don't get things settled down my health will fail and I will be unable to take care of if she ever returns. I found this morning I can't remember what I am doing either my brain is tired too I guess so for now I am going to sleep and try and gather a rational way to figure out what I will do next to get life stable. Over a reality of life created by others that I have no control over Thank You Charlie God Bless, David


 My Mary is 73 we have been together now for nearly 10 years and she has become my best friend and my right arm! A few months ago due to loss of memory and often becoming confused over many things. Her Primary care doctor sent us to a Neurologist who did many tests both physical and mental. She told us she had dementia and prescribed Aricept. We were told it was caused from so many years of her taking anti-depressants for her past and all the negatives she had been through! I finally got them pined down into tell us that her condition was not going to get any better that the medication she is on would only slow down the disease! We just started her on another new one to go with the Aricept called Namenda. For most of her life she has been on all kinds of pain killers along with anti-depressants! Currently she is taking over 12 different meds daily with 3 others on an as need be basis. She also is diabetic and has fibermyolgy and other Rheumatoid Arthritis. Added into that is also another mood altering med to help control a personality change in her that start a couple of weeks ago. We find she becomes so angry over the pain and memory loss that she can become so angry over things we can't control. I know I find some moments I want to hide but there is no place for me to go. I can't leave her alone for fear of what she may or may not do, due to forgetting her meds if I hide them she becomes angry over that. So I just keep a close eye on her continually! I note her memory comes and goes like an ocean wave and with that comes and goes confusion over the realities of the day or the moment. She takes moments of feeling pretty up beat then in the next breath she slips into complete mental and physical loss! When she realizes her loss memory issues on her up times she becomes more depressed which now becomes often translated into anger of which I take the blunt of. Due to memory loss I have to watch her closely because of all the meds she is on over the past we have spent hours on the phone or at our local ER because when Over Dosed on one prescript ion or the other. I find sometimes her repetitiveness in discussions over something just talked about will cause me to ask sure honey don't you remember? I found that is a big mistake to ask don't you remember. Or sometimes to remind her of things can cause great anger no matter how tack fully you ask. Are these experiences familiar to any of you and can you advise me from your experiences as to ways to keep her as content and happy as I can? And also what can I do to keep my mind from becoming depressed over what I am dealing with. I am with her 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I am all she has and she is all I have! I love her very much and will do what ever I can to make her life as pleasant as I can. HELP! If my words become entangled or repetitive forgive me its late at night and I have been cutting and pasting things into some kind of order! Sorry but from what I have written I'm sure someone will get the idea! What Else can I do to help her? Rabbin


 Thank You Howlyncat, For you comments I felt assured that I was not alone in coping with this disease. I put my faith in our Heavenly Father that He will guide me in right directions to the right people to help me do a better job of trying to help my Mary! I am not unfamiliar with the assistance things in our area but I do live in Texas in the United States and in a community that just cut its resources to local Alzheimer's Assoc. and from that they were forced to close their local offices in our area! I have talked to them and was aware of the 36 hour day book which I will be getting shortly. Understand Mary was put on Social Security and comes from a very poor family so her income level is well below poverty levels here in the US. I am according to the American Diabetes Assoc. one of the longest coping with Brittle Diabetics Alive in the US. and some of the side affects of that disease has put both physical and financial strain on my abilities as well! Mary has 9 children and most of them are so wrapped up in their own life's they have no idea what is going on even when I attempt to tell them and ask them to go with us to the doctor to hear it from the professionals they rarely have time other than for two of them who are thank God very helpful! So with all of your permissions I will now add you as a resource to help me keep my mind and heart on the right path to be the best that I can for her! I also find that my Bible is my greatest resource in seeking understanding of others and how all things including Mary's problems are related to to factors of how we think, feel, and do the things we do! As it is written, ""God is Love and Love is God"" your kind words and advise that comes from your heart and experiences come from such love and in that I send back my grateful and humble thanks. Along with the hope that all of us can extend ourselves as you have to me again thank you! I really needed someone to talk to that truly understands a disease I am just now learning about from our doctors and from what literature I can find. Please note if my posts seem a bit tarnished due to my health problems I just had eye surgery so my vision is a bit raw at the moment so typo errors are always with me but currently they are horrid! God Bless, Rabbin


 Thanks for replying I too struggle with this on a daily basis first mom and now my step dad It is so hard to see what is being done to them we now take the reversal of roles but I still treat my father with utmost respect and dignity ......... I have brothers and a sister that have not once done anything unless there was a pay off in it for them and that is so wrong and so sad but as Snowy points out it happens all over the world our Seniors are tossed away and in many cases treated as rubbish to the curb this rips my stomache apart We have no clue some: reports and statistics on how many are caring for their loved ones now ..... China has the Idealology of Keeping and Revering their Elders .... We need to instill this in our Children in our generation to come think about it we are all getting older and it may happen to me to who knows I too hold my Spirituality very close to my heart and I never walk alone .......... Many times I need to talk to Him and I do:sometimes not liking the answer...... Did you get a chance to read Pardraigs thread I think you will find some solace and total understanding there he is 75 and looks after his wife in home all alone His Book is also his pride he has written about his life and the caring of Jean .......His LOVE I believe you will find some fantastic support and Ideas in his story I have adopted them both as my grandparents The support and family we share here is very crucial to us all in our times of need and I knoww there are days I need it more than others as you no doubt do Snowy and Inert are here as well I know they will also help you anyway they can ........ I am honored that you have chosen to let us into your life and try to be a great support system and online buddy network to help you thru ...Healing Well is the best I have found and are the people....I sounds as though you have a grasp on info to help you with much of this but alwsay know we are here for you Post often May Your God Go With You Lyn


 That is so sad isnt it Rabbin the peeps of today are so different I was not brought up like that I am 52 and my hubby had diabetes as well .I have crohns and other illneses which I cope with daily but it was a no brainer when time came to look after parents regardless....... They never threw me away nor let me go with out anything how could I do that to them I am sure glad you are a part of our ""lil family"" here Gentle Huggs and always Remember ""Footprints "" Be well and God Bless Lyn


 That is truly my hope as well How are you doing today Rabbin As you can see I am always up before the sun to start my day tis a long but fulfilling one at the end of each I know I have done my best to be the best I can be and to help my fellow man making it so easy to have a clear concious . I hope and pray today will be a good one for you and Mary God Bless.


 I took Mary Friday morning on a trip to visit some of her Family in Floresville Texas. They had a festival in the town it is a place known for growing peanuts. A place where she spent her childhood and full of rich memories for her! We spent a couple of days with her sisters and brothers whom are still alive and for the most part it was good trip for her! Other than her family was surprised at how quickly she forgets things and how angry she gets over little things which is not like her! But other than for her moments of anger it was nice trip and we got home safely on Sunday afternoon! So other than being tired I am OK today and my diabetic condition is holding up as an RN my Hemo C run between 5 and 6 and other than running to low I sometimes I do pretty good! I hope you liked my mail and the words I sent gave you a good feeling about life and the hope in life that is always there for those of us who care for others and know that yes, ""I am my brothers keeper!"" It sound to me as though you are a thoughtful and loving person may God protect and keep you and your family. God Bless, Rabbin


 So Sorry to hear your not feeling well Please take care of yourself as you have advised me to do. I inturn tell you the same! God Bless, David aka rabbin


 Hy Lyn. Today was not a good day for me or her, Her son came over yesterday who is a police officer and said that he was going to take her to see her down to San Antonio to spend a couple of nights with a couple of her daughters. As a means to separate us and give us each a break from each other. I thought that was maybe good idea but Mary said I really don't feel good and I don't want to go. To alter her moods they just started her on trying a product called Depakote to maybe help control the anger she gets! And it as I understand it is a very harsh drug. And other antidepressants she takes must be cut back and even cut her down to one dose of two aspirin a day. I tried to explain this to him and he said OK pack up all her prescript ions and I will pick her up Thurs and meet her daughter down the road a ways to-wards San Antonio! She just said I don't want to go! He said well your going and I don't care what you say. and left saying he be back tomorrow which is today to see how your doing. Mary got up this morning and said I don't want to leave my home or lose my home here with you! I told not to worry its only for a couple of days enjoy yourself with the kids! Today was the last day for her to get her flu shots so I took her to the doctors and she wanted to get a new pair of shoes so I also took her to local store for that as well! On the way she said David I don't like being told they have made plans for me without asking what I want and I really don't want to go down there now I just don't feel good! I told her well tell him you don't and she said right now I'm so mad because they are forcing me to go when I don't want to go and they didn't even ask me what I wanted.. I told her just tell them and maybe later you may feel like and it then go! So you can call him and tell him and call your daughter and tell her so she won't feel bad! By the time we got home her son the cop showed up and she told him she didn't want to go and he said I don't care what you want your going. she please I don't want to go! He than raised his voice harshly and said I will be here in the morning to pick up. I said to him wait why don't when just wait and see how she feeling about it later. He said to me you keep the Hell out of it your nobody. I said I am somebody I have taken care of her and she has taken care of me for nearly 10 years and I think by law we may of not be by a ceremony but were common law. He said to hell with your common law adjectives I can't use. Mary is tears and said you don't come into our home and talk like this and I want you to leave. He said I will go when I get ready she my MOM and he came across the room at me. I said that's it we don't act that way here so I called the local PD to get him calmed down and out of here! I took over three hours her daughter showed up He had called them and told them I threw him out which I did! And she ended up going to San Antonio with them. From this leaving out a lot but you can tell I have my hands full! And my diabetic condition as you can imagine has been a mess today! I will watch sugars close that they don't fall too far and cause me to have insulin shock. I am alone but I feel with God's help I can keep it under control! I am very brittle to begin with and sugars are hard to keep in control but OK for the moment. Thanks for being there to listen and if you have time say a prayer for my Mary and for me too! I feel so strongly that our only hope in tomorrow and in the moment is in our love and faith for our God by what ever name he has been given he is the same God. and to me His son is Jesus Christ. So if you have a moment talk to Him for me and For MY Sweet Mary that she sleeps well tonight and peace will return! God Bless, David aka rabbin


 So far no word from Mary today. She was suppose to of come home this morning but instead I got a call from one of her daughters telling me not today she'd bring her tomorrow! We discussed the situation with what the son had done in more detail and as we talked I could tell she was not going to be very supportive. I feel they now think it is my fault she is so down and depressed and have hung it all on me! It was bad enough when My Sweet Mary would get angry saying I was controlling her when I would try and keep her from doing harm to herself by taking her meds to frequently! But when mature adults believe their mom who is afflicted with this horrible illness is right and I am contorling her to me this goes beyond logic! When I call down where she is suppose to be they won't answer their phones. Last I heard she was going to call me tonight but so far I have heard nothing! I believe they are working at trying to figure out how to convincer to stay down there. She is and has been my right side now for nearly 10 years and I knew this was what they were up to when she left! And now I am pretty well convienced of it and there is nothing I can do! But sit alone and wallow in my own tears! By not talking to me is what hurts the most not knowing what they are up to has me an anxious wreck and my diabetes is at the moment a mess! Early this AM I went into insulin shock right now its pretty high just too 5 units of Novalog trying to get it down will check it again in an hour! Oh didn't tell you I also had a stint put in me about 3 years ago so far the bP looks pretty good. I take antenol and captopr heart and for bp. But I will do ok! But this is not helping me either! I spoke to my sister in Iowa today on the phone she told me to just stay calm and always remember you did the best you could for Mary. And we have been given a good life together before all this. I don't know how to explain or show them I do not control her but the sickness and the meds do! I have had a chance to read the book on 36 hours yet because I'm still going on my own 48! And I have noted that her children now have become experts on the condition and have been telling me all the things where I have not treated Mary right. Fine time to tell me this, they never came around before! They refer to me as a know it all because I tried to tell them she gets confused over facts because her memory comes and goes and she just forgets. They tell me to not to say anything to her about losing it but how do you keep from doing that when she begs for a pain pill that I just gave her and that she should wait 6 hours between getting the next one! They just don't understand those things and I am worried she may get too much meds or get into some Aspirn or something eles with Depkote that she should't get. Why is there a limitation for those taking that med combined with such things as Asprin? Any how keep the prayer going for her and maybe just a notation for me! thanks Forgive all the typo errors tonight David aka rabbin


 Thank You Lyn, Your words encourage me to know that in this world I am not completely alone. I know that God is watching and My Lord is always by my side and Mary's! As far as legal help I am in the Heart of Hill country in Texas and there is no legal aid in this area for the poorer of the community nor will any attorney's here listen to any of this maybe only politely! Her son that caused all the problems in part of this communities GOOD O' BOY's He has been with the local Police Dept. for many years and is a ranking member of their gold shield (detective) group! I have no control on any of this nor can obtain it! I can only worry about her well being. I will talk to her doctor Monday if I can reach her! There is no Alzheimer's local office here because the local county would not fund it well enough to keep it here. The community is a retirement area and there are many elderly folks here whom have dementia and Alzheimer's problems. But that is a reality of the area so legally I am trapped on this issue. I did inform them that I would no longer cater to their demands in my (our) home that if they could come and go and see her anytime they wanted that I would never come between her and them after all she is their mother and I felt they should be willing enough to show such respect for both her as their mother and for me as the one who has taken good care of her for all these years! The common law issue on Texas is a three prong law of proof of or as. For her she gets some state help for her health Medicare and Medicaid and if we declare marriage rights she will lose her Medicaid because what I earn is then combined with hers which throws everything out that she has gotten and will continually get! As well as take away some smaller breaks that I get on my health care! It is as it is in the US today no matter how the election turns out here in Texas this will not change. This is an Ultra Conservative State that equitable rules for all people do not apply! There are one set of rules for the wealthy and one set for the working and lower economically class of peoples! I am not in that upper position and my health as well as my resources are very limited keeping me from hiring an attorney that may want to deal with such a case and here one to do against this establishment is very limited. Her sons best friends wife was the country treasure here! I am not afraid of them for that reality my life is drawing to-wards a close too so so therefore taking what I don't have doesn't bother me and one day when its my time I will be with our Lord and I feel hopeful He will look well at me and I know He knows I have done the best I could with every thing He has put before me including Mary's children who have no concept of such thinking. The world's ways are made up of the things of this world and for me I know such will rust and fall apart I will hold on to my knowledge that His World is made up only of a righteous spirit that I can hope that we all will be worthy enough to accept! So keep up the prayers all needed and wanted above all things and cry not for Mary and I but cry for them who have lost their hearts of comprehending are blinded by their own lights! I pray for them daily even though I ma so angry at them for what they have done out of arrogance and synonymous with that is just plan ignorance for that I am very sad for them! As it is written God is Love and Love is God and to be one with God means I copy such love not for self but for those who do us the most harm! Again thank you and cry not be glad for me that as one person in my ending years I know the truths of the errors of my own ways and accept that God is in control and from these errors of my own and from His control I am a better person who accepts the Holy Spirit of my Lord! IN that smile over what you have read of me and My sweet Mary for she is not mine she like you is His too as are her children! Plus I thank God for the words from somebody so far away who has given me over the past fews day so much encouragement to endure during these rough times! God Bless, David aka rabbin


 David .......I read your posts and I cannot help but cry with you and for you and mary This is so wrong I have to believe God Has a plan .........he always does Try Azinfo.org I believe they may be able to give you some input The doctor has to be able to help with this as well she can make a legitamate statement on your behalf of your loving care for Mary your medication issues and that she was well looked after and love immensely at home with you I do not believe she is happy and I too am sorried about her well being Cops do stick together and that to is wrong IMO Please kno I am constantly thinking of you and Mary and have both of you 's in my heart and Prayers'I am going to contact a lawyer friend of mine that delas with American /canadian Law in Widsor and Detroit and tell him some of this to see if there are any loopholes that can be taken to get her home where I KNOW she wants and needs to be I hope you wont mind if I try all I can do is try rigth PLEASE look after you this is going to put you in hospital and you know that as well as I do nad I believe our mary does as well I will get back to you asap Take care and be well please my friend ....God Bless you are not alone in this nor are you crying silent and lonely tears I too am with you as He is Lyn


 Hi David, I have read all your posts to-date. What Mary's children have done appears unbeliveable. If they care for their Mom, I hope they know what they are doing, though I doubt it. A lot will depend at what stage of AD she's at. I know that when I placed my wife in a Nursing Home some five years ago she went down hill quickly, she gave up, stopped eating etc. I now know had I not removed her and took her home to care for her myself she would not be alive to-day. If her children are going to care for her they'd better be ready for her loss of speech, loss of special awareness (when falls are likly to happen) and of course double incontinence. It would be about seven years ago my wife's sisters took her for a holiday with them. With my blessing of course, they live 100's of miles away. A few days later they brought her back saying something came up which 'messed' up their plans. I understood and although they have not seen her for about two years I know they love her, maybe they can't handle the pain. 'Like to remember her the way she was.' All things happen for a reason, you may yet be left to pick up the pieces. As you love your Mary all you can do is hope and pray that her children are in their way making her life well. Sorry I can't be of much help, don't know US law, but the law of love, and love hurts the most of all. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Charlie thank you so much I am so glad you and David connected I was so praying this would happen I knew you could talk to him from the same place he is at with looking after His wife and Now all this I am so hurt for him as well and I too cannot believe how they did this to them both .You are an Angel I told you that long ago and it is so true How is G Jean today ......I have not been home took Cait out for a treat with us so we had ""Family"" time and then went and got my infusion as well at hospital I have those sores back with a vengance and because the picc line was having issues it had to come out my Doc managed to find a vein but I have to go to hospital for infusions of meds Anyways how are you feeling and how is the weather there?? It is turning quite cold way to early here shows what has been done to Mother nature ...........I believe we are in for a very hard cold winter here . Keep care of you please and gentle hugggs to G Jean for me ....Butterfly kisses as always God Bless Love Lyn"
new here,"Hi all. I have just discovered the HW site and Alzheimer forum. My mom and dad (both 82) have AD. They are living in their own home, a bungalow in a senior's complex, with home support four hours per day over breakfast and lunchtime. I go in the evenings to make dinner and give evening meds. The progression of Dad's AD has been slow. He was diagnosed approximately eight years ago. Mom however has been quite rapid over the past two years. They are mobile, walking independantly and able to eat unassisted if meal is put in front of them. I feel so fortunate that so far they have been able to stay in their own home where everything is familiar. I work in long term care facility (nursing home) in Canada and so am aware of the final stages of AD. The really cool thing about mom and dad is that its like they only have half a brain left each but because they are together they help each other and rely on each other and so together there's a whole brain there (almost!) lol Anyways I am glad to have a place to talk to others who will understand. I am sure I wil be here often as I don't sleep well (menopause) but that's a whole other issue.","Hello and welcome to the board. I look forward to reading more of your posts. I loved the way that you described the way that your parents help each other out. And as Lerie said, great board name.


 Middleagecrazy Was wondering how you are doing and how your parents are ,havent seen you post so I thought I would see if I could find you........Hope all is well .....God Bless.....Lyn


 Hi Middleagecracy,catchy name, I like it. Welcome to HW forum. there are a lot of supportive caring people here.I like your sense of humor in the middle of all this. My thoughts & prayers are with you. later....

My grandmother,"My father and I watch my 89-year-old grandmother on a daily basis. He would rather have her in his house than a nursing home and I just help out when he needs to get out. My question is this--she is in the final stage of Alzheimer's and we all know this, but she is starting to gag on everything that she eats. Is she near the end?","Bump for new member


 Thanks Snowy........It is called by that name?.........I have not heard of it here in Canada but thats nothing new lol.......Hope you and Larry are well........God Bless.......Lyn


 Oh hun I am so sorry........I will keep you and your Dad in my thoughts and prayer's.........keep coming here to get your support,we all do really care...........take care of you as well ....God Bless............Lyn


 Welcome to HW and thanks for your input .....hope to see you post often,it is a great group of peeps here........God Bless.....Lyn


 So sorry that yourgrandmother and you are having to go through that. My grandmother lived for over a year having to eat mashed bananas, ice cream and ensure diet supplements. I wish you and your family the very best.


 Bump


 Hi Trock and Welcome.........I have a few questions for you and I hope we can help you out with this ........You say Grandma is starting to gag on her food right.....Does she have particular food she enjoys??? Is it possible to put her food in a food processor and have it so it is like babies food? I know this sounds horrid but I am sure that you will have the same thing if she is put in a nursing home? I am sure she has her likes and dislikes as we all do .......Do you include Ensure or Boost with her intake daily? Milkshakes made with this is great too and helps with the weight... This is a good source of vitamins and the nutrients needed.....Maybe you could post some more info and the folks on here will gladly do their best to help you out.......We have ""Snowy"" that I am sure will be along as well as some others that are on this forum........It is hard when you have to see this life being taken by this DD ,I have Mom and my step Dad both with AD and I look after them........My heart breaks when I see that there are peeps like you and your Dad keeping her home where she is getting the love and attention she so deserves.......Have you talked to the Doc about this at all and if so what is their recommendations re: her eating ........How much does your Grandma weigh like is she a wee person ?? It is quite possible that she doesnt like the texture of the foods or has even forgotten how to eat and swallow IMO........I am so sorry that you and your dad are going thru this but I must say I am glad that you both have her best interests at heart......I know I have asked alot of questions lol,but I would like to help you as would the others on the forum find some solutions if possible........Please post and let us know how things are going ,your Dad is welcome as well to come here and get the support he needs too.........Please take care and God Bless.....I will watch for your post..........if you need to talk all my info is under my name and please do not hesitate to get in touch.........Be well and know you and your Dad are not alone in this we have a wonderful support system here on HW.........Lyn.

My Mom........Breaks My Heart !!,"Oh Lyn, how hard that is to go through. I can't even imagine. Never had a real Mom, but had woman in my life who were like Moms to me. Will she take Instant Breakfast or milk shakes ? I don't like Ensure and those types, as they're made of all partially hydronated vegatable oil. That garbage clogs arteries big time. When my appetite went ... I could always go for milk shakes or cottage cheese. I hope her Dr. will give you some good suggestions, following her exam. But, you are doing so much Lyn. You can't control it all. Her weight loss, surely is not your fault and neither is her inability to see all you're doing to help. I hope you're getting adequate rest for yourself. If I had a daughter like you, or if even a fraction of Mom's that are elderly or ill did ... wow. Please know you are special and appreciated here, especially as a role model. You know I'm honored to have met you, from day one. Hugs and many prayers for you and your family. Ann","Snowy I do make her all kinds of things she eats like a wee bird .......she does love shake and ice cream .....and chocolate cake ....Cait made her one last night so we will take it over tonight for her as a surprise .........I am going over in a couple of hours to take her to the doc's .....It is time I had professiomal help such as him along with me I cannot do it all ........Thanks for you concern............God Bless.........Lyn


 Well got her to the docs and she blew up right there .....he had not seen her in the anger mode so it was an eye opening experience for him lol.........we have come up with a good amount of calories for her to start at and work up........I am going to make her shakes and let her eat all the cake and Tim Horton's goodies she wants (will have to travel to get them ) but it will be worth it ......Her blood was tested as well for her Tegretol (seizure meds) levels ....he went over her as much as she would allow and I will check out what I can later .........Thanks all for being here as usual .......You will never know how you all help me thru every day .....I feel like I am 70 not 52 and yet when Mom yells at me I feel about 2 figure that one out .......Long day .......Thanks again all of you, you are the best support system and friends ......God Bless ......Blue I am sorry about your Dad hun I know how hard it is ,...we shall get theu this together with each other and all the other great members and friends /support system here .......You need me you know where I am only an email away ........Lyn


 Hi Lyn, sounds like you have a huge amt. on your plate there.Please talk to the DR. about getting some type of home care in to help you so you don,t go into melt down & get sick yourrself.

 I am so sorry to hear about your Mom Lyn. You realy do need that homecare for your Mom by the sound of it. There is only one of you lyn and you can only do so much. Take care of you too. (((((Lyn))))) Sue


 Lynn, I'm so glad you are going to be getting help with taking care of your Mom. It's a big job and having help will be good for all of you. I hope her new ""diet"" helps her to feel better. It will take time, I'm sure. She eats like a wee bird... because she is a wee bird. She is lucky to have you looking out for her and your Dad too in such a loving and caring way.

 Hi there .......been at the hospital most of the night....not responding well yet to antibiotics but is holding her own ......I really think she knows it is almost her time to go home to her Maker........I believe she is at peace with that .....at least I want to believe it ......it breaks my heart to see her like that and Dad is just fumbling about ........Howie keeps him busy but he doesnt like hospitals and he keeps looking for Mom.......Ahhhhh............I get so darned choked up over all this anymore,try to be strong and I fall apart but at least I have all of you and the others that I talk with on this site ...it really does come down to your friends on here at least for me as you all know what I am feeling .......God Bless and be well all......Lyn


 Hi all went over to bathe and wash Mom's hair and I took a really good look at her (I have been sick so I have been in and out ) and she is looking like skeleton.......I weighed her and that was a chore her yelling at me it wasnt my business how much she weighs and all kinds of other things ....Dad had no idea what was going on upstairs and Cait came up so we calmed her down ....she weighs 76 lbs and is literally skin and bones ..I know she eats as I prep their food.......I am calling the doc tomorrow and have a thorough (sp) physical done it is that time ..........I cried all the way home it hurts so much to see this going on ........I just needed to vent a wee bit ......hard having your Mom yelling at you not knowing that I am only concerened for her ........Breaks my heart..........Thanks for listening .......God Bless ......Lyn


 Lyn,It doesn't matter what you can get in her to eat or drink,anything will do,at this stage of the game.


 Ann......Hi there and Thanks ......there are many of us out there that do as I do so I dont really think I am so special for being there for parents who were always there for me ..........it helps with my retirement /nursing home bkgd but it sure dont help the heart ya know .........Take care sweetie and thanks .............God Bless.......Lyn


 Lyn,ask the Dr.about getting hospice in.


 Thanks all for your support ,I am going to talk with the doc about some home care coming in even 3 days a week at least it will help me to get other things done ..God Bless..Lyn

 Hi Lyn, I'm soooo sorry your mom is having all these new issues (worsening issues?). It is so hard to see our parents in such condition. You are doing all you can sis, please know that you have made a huge difference in her care. Sorry I haven't visited Alz forum for so long. I have been fairly busy lately and haven't much puter time. I raised a little of pups and sold them for a handsome price so it was nice to be the breadwinner for a tiny spell. Am back on methatrexate and I think it is helping. I hope you've been ok . . . I do think about you often and enjoyed seeing your pics recently . . . made me smile to really get ot meet you!! You have a beautiful family!! Love and blessings!


 Hi hun.....it went well I have peeps in for her 3 days a week ......right now though she has pneumonia..........really dont know if she will make it this time ,has lost her ability in both legs as well ......I have been back and forth ,but will prob have to spend more time with her ..........I have a feeling you know ........thanks for your care and will let you know what is going on ...........God Bless........Lyn

Please know if I could help you now, I would love to sit with you and just be there. Please email me whenever, but I will keep a better watch for your posting here now.

I have a hard time being in the house still, the memories are beautiful but painful....

Well thanks for letting me vent lol......I am doing okay and up a bit but I just dont want him to go as well .........Take care all and God Bless..Lyn","Hi Sis, I really enjoyed our chat today. I fear the doctor is right, your dad really does need to griev. It really hard for you because you have a need to tidy up all the lose encd before you begin grieving in earnest. You deal with it the way I do. We just do all we can in a situation and then colapse. I'm hoping you can take some time to keep your feet up and let that leg begin to heal. You really need to take care of YOU so that you'll be around a good long time to take care of your dad. I am always amazed at how the hard things in life pile up all at once. You are in a tough time sis. You are on my mind often throughout the day and I will continue lifting your needs up to the Lord. Blessings!

help for my mother and me,"hi I'm new, and have some questions that i hope you can help with. my father and mother where told 6 month ago that he has the starting stages of Alzheimer's, and has been doing ok. well now always around 5pm or so doesn't know how my mom is and waints to go find here. My mother and i what to know if there are any tips for handling this topic...thanks in advance for the help....john","Hi John, I am SO sorry to hear about your dad's alzheimers. My dad has alzheimer's also. He often asks about ""his mother"" when we were honest and said that ""she died a long time ago"" dad would cry. Now we realize that he is actually asking about ""his wife"". It seems that he gets all the pronouns (he/she) and the titles (mother, sister, wife, daughter) all mixed up. Most everyone is a ""he"" and most female family members are ""his mother"". He will introduce me as ""his mother"" and he will talk about my mom, his wife, as being ""his mother"". We now know to tell him, ""mom is fine, she will be home at 2:00 (or whenever she is expected home). All this confusion is very hard to take, but it is very helpful to dad if we don't correct him or try to make him understand the correct words to use. I can tell you from experience that the more time you spend with him, the better you will become at communicating with him and helping him to enjoy the time he has left. Dad also wants to ""go home"" all the time even though he is in the same house that he has lived in for 30 years. It doesn't ever help if we tell hi that he IS at home . . . often I will take him for a ride around the block and he is very content when we get back ""home"". Snowy has alzheimer's herself and has cared for patients with alzheimers and she is a real pro in this forum. Lyn will be along to greet you too. She lost her mom several days ago to alzheimers, but she was also an alzheimer's nurse, so she is very helpful as well. I hope you are able to enjoy the time that you get to spend with your dad. I cherish every minute I can and I always try to enjoy him just as he is. My wishing he wasn't afflicted with the DD wastes my energy and robs me of enjoying his company so I really try to kind of meet hi where he is at. I am glad to meet you and glad that you are a son who spends time with his parents. Blessings!


 johnw....Hi and Welcome to HW...I have never used distorting truths with AD peeps but I do know it is a common practice.....Mom never really had to be fibbed to lol she although striken with this DD was pretty good allll round ......I am so glad you were able to find us here there are a great group of peeps on here that will help .In my honest opinion I would ask Snowy your question as she has AD and is quite valuable to our peeps and will tell you anything you need to know .Snowy is a special lady loved by all ....please keep coming back and posting I will bump some old threads up for u .You take care and spens as much time as you can with them I did and I have just recently lost Mom ......I am hapy and fullfilled for all her and I shared her last few yrs .......God Bless......Lyn


 That's what they call ""sundowning"".Is he on any medications for dementia?Have a frank talkwith his Dr.get answers to your questions.Who diagnosed him,Primary Dr.or Neurologist?Neurologist is the one who knows.Was he tested?OR just diagnosed by being in the Drs.office for a short time?


 thank you so much for your kind words. My dad and i where not that close until 5 years ago. we where really starting to get really close when this all started to happpen. My folks have seen a Neralagist(Bad speller here) and he's the one that told us he has AD. He was tested and is on meds, not shure whitch one i will find out. I have suggested to my mom, that when dad dosent know you as his wife try to make friends as the person his wife left to watch him. Is this a good or bad idea? thanks again for your help...john"
Mom......Her Gift.....,"Hi all just an update found out that Mom's eyes (she had donated them) have gone to 2 different people .......I told cait about this and she kinda was flustered til I explained that now because of her Nana there will be 2 peeps that are now able to see all the beauty in the world and if you look hard and long enough you will see it it is there we are just so swamped with all the horror going on in todays world. I am able to explain all this to Cait yet I ,although I know that Moms eyes were for the good to help someone I still feel kinda weird......knowing that 2 people out there are now seeing thru her gift......The Donor place called my Dad which thru him into a tizzy but as I told a great friend I think this brought him to some semblance of reality with Mom's passing......he didnt seem to really believe ya know.......Anyways just wanted to touch base and let you's know and once again thank all for wrapping me so gently in your arms thru all of this..it has been and is so hard but it is made easier with your love and caring.......God Bless..Lyn","What a totally Unselfish thing for your Mother to do. Imagine the gratitude these folks are feeling as they think of your Mom always now with each new day for them. I know your Mom sees them from Where she Is. She has a perfect body now, as we're promised in Heaven, so you can imagine her grinning for these people as they get excited with each new thing they see. How proud you must be. And how proud we are to share in all of these stories with you. And see you come through it all, right in front of us, in your posts. Strength is contagious ... and it's being passed onto Cait. Just like my grandmother and my Dad have passed it to me and reading your posts confirms it all. 'Thanks Lyn.' We Love you ! Ann


 Awe . . . that is such a beautiful thing Lyn. I'm glad your dad has stepped into the next stage of grieving. *sigh* Wish is didn't have to be so hard. I hope you'll give him a hug from Rosie and tell him that I care. Blessings!


 Hey Lyn, Actually, I am v-e-r-y gradually feeling better. Went outside and planted 8 pots yesterday and moved them around the yard with a wagon to set them here and there. I love gardening but the pots are easier to maintain because I can water them w/o trying to water every bed in the yard. How sweet! I bet your dad DOES like the market!! My dad shuns any type of shopping. I can take him with me and run a zillion errends if we are going in and out of places and checking off to-do list. The market sounds like fun!! I hope you are getting enough rest and watching that you don't beat yourself up!! Blessings!

Does my da have Alzheimer's,"Hi, I'm new to this forum and would like some advice. My dad is a very intelligent person. However, for the last year or so my family has noticed a marked decline in his ability to comprehend things and it seems to get noticiable more and more on a monthly basis. How would you go about getting tested for this terriable desease. Could it be somthing other than Alzheimer's? Thanks for your response. Jim","Hi Jim and Welcome to HW......Glad you have found us and I am really glad Snowy posted to you ...........It is a horrid disease and I looked after Mom til a couple of months ago when she passed away ....now my step dad is the one I am looking after ..he has declined rapidly compared to how Mom's was........he is getting worse each day and I feel in my heart it shall prob not be long til he goes to Mom and his Maker.Thay were together for over 40 yrs and I know he is heartbroken even if his mind isnt all that it use to be .............he will go with me to Wednesday market or soon we shall be going fishing ,something we have done together since I was 9 or so ......Anyways Jim I would do as Snowy suggessted have your Dad see a Neurologist just to find out for sure what is going on and please do come back and post also there are alot of threads well worth reading on here .....Padraig's is a good one 'Message To Send""......I will bump some more up for you .........take care and God Bless......Lyn


 I suggest you have his Dr.have him see a Neurologist for testing.He will be tested for everything.Sometimes an off kilter thyroid,or anemia can cause mental breakdown,but It's nice to be sure..................

 Hia Lyn, wanted to come over here to see how things are 'really' going. sigh. My heart's going out to you and your Dad. My Dad was always the type that no one Ever saw sad or mad or complain, but when my last step-mom passed, he could barely talk for months. He was almost 85 when she passed. But then he met a really cute chick - 84 years old and he's a happy man. Very happy. We never thought it would happen, but this lady is the best lady he's ever had. He was widowed twice and my mom left him for no good reason, so this is #4 for him. He's the real faithful type, so it's not like he was a gigallo or something ... ha. Maybe y'all could go to the Senior Get-to-gethers, and find some Seniors for him to hang out with. My Dad moved to a Seniors Place and first he met another widower man who became a good talking buddy. Well, I just wanted to come by here and tell you my thoughts have never left you nor my prayers and hoping things will gradually get better for your Dad. There wasn't much we (as my dad's kids) could do for our Dad, except invite him over for meals or take him places of interest, but that was about it. You take good care of you , please. Love & Hugs, as always, Ann again


 Hi Lyn, You guessed right I have been busy, and flustrated dealing with lawers in Ireland. How I wished I never started with this Redress Board dealing with abuses committed to children so many years ago. They can't begin to understand the thinking of a child locked away from the outside world, brought up to respond to every command of a whistle. They are amazed I can't remember the name of a child who died from eating the pods of a laburnum tree. It was back in 1937/8 we all eat the leaves of the trees, clover, haws etc. I had a liking for carbolic soap! Jean is doing fine. This is one of her beauty days. I was puzzled how she could look so young and fresh one day the next washed out. Our daughter noticed it as did others. The answer was there in front of me. Having opened her bowles made all the difference. I ensure they open at least every other day. Twice a day I place Lactulose in her drinks. Her morning meal is weatabix in warm milk washed down with a warm drink of Nestle's Build up with teaspoon of honey. I found using a glass with 3 1/2 inch dia best to watch her drink. A lunch of 4 fresh veg finely mashed in soup, finished off with 2 or 3 biscuits and a drink of Cranberry juice from a clear baby bottle. Her evening meal is always finely mashed bananna and honey warmed in the micro/w. A Yogurt and some biscuits washed down with blackcurrant juice from the bottle. This diet keeps her around 115lbs a little above her normal weight. In the nursing home they talked a lot about TLC like politicians. I couldn't see loving care and told them their's load was a load of.... ""Try my LOAD"" ""What's that?"" LOOK, OBSERVE, ANALYSE, DECISION. So sorry to learn your Dad was not too well, my heart goes out to you. I will never know the pain of seeing a parent suffer. I recall courting Jean, buying flowers and chocolate, she thought were for her. They were for her Grandma. Taking her to see her G/M: ""You are so lucky to have Parents and Grandparents"". She thought it sad, not me: ""I'm lucky I'll never have to suffer or begin to imagine the pain of losing a parent"". God moves in strange ways. There are always blessings, cheer up. It's good to be back. May your God go with you. Padraig.


 Padraig .........Oh you dont know just how much I believe HE works in ways we could never....I was getting so worried about not hearing from you and then I turned on this and there was your story..... I feel so bad for you as did Jean ,although it is a very difficult thing losing a parent it had to have been hades during your childhood. You sure are not a product of your environment as I see it anyways the way you describe Jean I can almost see her and it feels as though I have known you both for years........ I have lost a son at age 6 and that was so hard as well ,but losing Mom has been the hardest thing I have had to cross so far in my 52 yrs,I look for her in so many places ,I feel her and smell her.......we had a bond I cannot explain in words and I cry silent tears so as not to alarm Cait and worry her......I know that Nursing homes can be H but there are a few that are fo the people that are in need and do not have us that will look after them. Your load is so right as well.....I was not the kind of nurse that could leave her patients at the nursing home come quitting time I was involved and it is a lesson you are taught in nursing school not to get close ....How can you not ? There are so many there that are brought in dropped off and no one comes to see them again til their death and the finding out ""who was left what"" you know. Empathy is not hard to have if you dig deep and put yourself aside and look at what they feel and go thru. I know Mom was in there just as you know Jean is and thats what made me want to spend as much time with her as possible,plus I had promised her yrs ago she would never be put into a home. I will not do that with Dad either..he came into my life at age 8 and gave me the love and care I needed to mature and grow into someone that knew she was loved and loved deeply. I sure gave him the run for his life I despised him at first thinking he was taking Mom from me....then as I matured I came to love and respect this wonderful man that I call dad and that is from my heart I have no other father but him and never will..........This man took on 3 kids that were not his w/o hesitation and adopted us and has never once denied any of us and treated us as equals to his bio daughter........As you can see it is nothing short of admiration I have for him ........Anyways Padraig thanks for finally getting back I know you are busy and I kinda am a worrier lol but I hope you do not mind I have kinda adopted you and Jean as my grandparents if thats okay .......I have the utmost respect and admiration for you as well ....You have alot to give the people on this forum and I hope they will learn from you ..you are a sweet loving man grandpa .....Keep in touch ..am sending you a pic of Caitlyn and I with our old Minister...Love and God Bless .Huggs to you and Gradma jean


 Hi Lyn, That's a high honour to bestow on anyone, you build me up no end. Have you ever heard ""Anyone can by a father, but it takes someone very special to be a Dad"". You have him. In the begining I found a lack of understand by many in the medical profession of the importance of the carer's bond with the loved one. I was not informed as to the medication Jean was given in hospital. Only after her discharge did I discover why she was always asleep on my visits. I was to keep her quiet, you couldn't meet a quieter person. Is it any wonder after a month's stay she couldn't walk? At the nursing home I asked the nurse about the medication she was being given:""You'll have to ask the doctor"". Because I had taken to spending 8 hrs a day at the home the doctor remarked: ""Your doing a fine job for your wife"". ""No I'm not"" He seemed puzzled :""Why ever not?"" I shot back without thinking ""Doesn't a dog look after his pups?"" These years later I have thought about the remark and I'm pleased with it, it's me. For the first time I have gained a sense of self worth, for I know carers are bestowed the task because they are special people. I have spent a lifetime trying to prove I'm not a reject. Sport, achived national honours, position, Superintendant with Lockheed, able to retire in comfort at 54. Only now by loving and being a carer have I gained a sense of self worth. There appears to be much more fruit in life's garden, it's always tasted good now it's even better. Thank you all for showing the labour you put in. Next a special Christmas. May your God Go with you. Padraig.


 Padraig ,how are things going?.......Having some trouble with dad yesterday was really bad I havent slept at all .......I am hoping today will be better.......Gentle huggs to you and grandma Jean.......I hope she has a wonderful Mother's day....God Bless.....Lyn


 Hope all goes well Lyn... I will keep him, you and your family in my thoughts.


 Thanks both of you ...Snowy I agree he has not had time to grieve I dont think he relly believes Mom is gone sometimes .I know I remind him of her so much this has to be hard on him.....The doc put him on a new med so I am hoping this will help......Take care all and God Bless....Lyn


 I think they are starting to work or maybe it is me hoping so much lol.I picked up Mom's ashes yesterday so have to plan with the other's what we are going to do with them .I have decided to put mine in a small vial around neck on a gold chain I think I am not sure yet things are still really confusing and out there for me yet.You take care and thanks for all your support.........God Bless.....Lyn


 Hi Lynn, I'm sooo sorry about your dad. I'm glad the meds are helping a bit. You are such a blessing to him . . . I bet you make God smile!! Gosh Lyn, it really hasn't been too long since you lost your mom. He is probably taking a longer time to grieve. He may be bathing himself in his sadness. Sometimes we just need to be sad for a while before we can move on. He'll move on to the next stage of grieving in his own time. Caring for the dog is good for him (lol, as long as the dog doesn't sucomb to obesity). This must be so hard on you sis . . . to see him so sad. You might try being sad ""with"" him and see if he'll talk about it at all. Don't push him too hard . . . he's just not ready yet. You are a such a good daughter! Blessings!


 Give your dad a birthday hug from Rosie!! I hope he enjoys everyone's company!! A headache???? Uhhhh ohhhhh . . . sorry sis! Blessings!


 Birthday party went okay but seemed like alot of tension as per usual when all the siblings get together..........I kinda just feel like they all dont think before they act you know .........anyways just a quick update .......Lyn


 Thanks Ann........Dad isnt interested in young ones he already said.......They have to come already trained lol........It has been real hard and getting harder for me as Mother's day approaches,.....Thanks for your thoughts .Hope you stay well and with us we all missed you ....Love and God Bless........Lyn


 Dear Lyn, I understand about Mother's Day. I'm just grateful you have your Cait. When my daughter found me, I was still grieving the loss of my mom, and having a daughter sure helped me get through that next Mother's day. about my Dad. This new sweetheart of his I told about above, is 84 or 85 and he's 88. They'll be going on a cruise this month and went to Italy together last year. ha. The strange thing is, there's three floors of Apartments where he moved and 120 apartments total and he's in Apt. #313 and ""coincidently"", she was right there in 314. It made all of us believe ""Anything's Possible"" Love you Lyn and you're wrapped in His merciful arms of compassion and our hearts too. Always.


 My Sweet Ann...Thank you for understanding and your support it means the world to me ....you are truly amaxing my friend .....Be well and God Bless...Lyn


 Thank you Padraig yes I have heard that and I firmly believe in it as well....I would have been pleased myself saying what you did .....it must have really ticked the Doc off lol....You have so much to be proud of walk with your head held high alwyas you know you have earned it ....I wait for your stories and think of you and grandma Jean often thru my day........I have not sent the picture yet but will am getting alittle down as Mother's day approaches I miss her so much .......Please give Grandma Jean a gentle loving hug and while your at it one for you too.....See you tomorrow ....God Bless and Keep you forever strong and as Loving as you are ......Lyn"

Brother passed away.,"eyes To get right to the point, one of my brothers (56 years old) died last night. He has epilepsy resulting from a traumatic injury when he was 18 years old (car vs. pedestrian). He was in the Navy at the time and htchhiking home to say goodby before shipping off (Vietnam erra). He has had many, many seizures which the docs have been unable to control for any length of time. Last night, while he was sleeping, he had a seizure. After 5 minutes of seizing, his wife called 911. They arrived within 5 minutes. The seizure put him into cardiac arrest and he never pulled out of it. We are a large, close-knit family and we deal well with grief . . . but could really use some prayers for my poor mom. We also lost a sister to cancer when she was just 37 years old. My mom is quite a trooper, but it still takes a tole. Dad has alzheimers and he doesn't understand, yet, what has happened . . . but he has been a real cutie so far . . . he has a hard time seeing us cry and he does very cute things to try and help . . . just like a child would. He is such a blessing. Thanks for your prayers. Love and Blessings,","SIS ........I am so sorry for your loss ..........my heart is breaking knowing what you are going thru ........of course we will all pray for you ,your family and your brother ........you do so much for EVERYONE on here that I know all will reciprocate ......If you need to talk sis know I am here okay .......give Dad a big hugg and a special hugg full of love and warmth with alot of understanding to your Mom ...........God Bless Her................you need help with anything let me know ok ................Love you sis .............God Bless .......Lyn


 Hey sis just checking to see how you are doing ....all my love ....prayer's and thoughts are with you ...........God Bless ........Lyn


 Hi Rosie! It's good to hear from you - I was wondering how you were - so it's great hearing that you finally got a good night's sleep - sometimes that is a good start in the healing process! Sending positive thoughts for you and your family and keeping you in my prayers. Big Hugs, Teri :)


 Hey Lyn, Wow . . . I didn't know you went through that too. Mom is doing OK. She has always had a really good attitude. We lost my sister about 10 years ago to cancer and Mom told people that God blessed her with 37 years with Donna and that she would be happy for that 37 years. Now she faces the loss of another child (56 years old) with the same grace and faith. Wow, what a role model!! Thank you for the prayers sis and I hope things are a bit calmer at your house. I know you've had some trials in your family as well. How are you? Blessings!


 Rosie, I hope that you are gaining more emotional strength as each day passes. Your Mom sounds like a very remarkable woman! My best wishes to you, your Mom and family. Lyn, I didn't know that you canceled Howie's BD dinner?! You know you are a very remarkable woman yourself! I'm so very sorry for the loss of your son, how hard that must be. I'm sending my best wishes to you and your family as well! Big Hugs to you both, Teri


 Hope your days are looking brighter?! Hugs, Teri


 Maybe it's best he doesen't know.............Sorry for your loss.........


 Rosie, this has to be a very tough time for all of you. My prayers are with you and your family. Hugs, Teri


 Hello Lyn, Teri, Snowy, Well, the funeral was lovely and I slept very well and LONG last night. Thank you so much for your love, thoughts and concern. Blessings! P.S. Dad made it his job to try and keep everyone cheered up. He was just so cute. I'm glad he didn't have the crushing experience of loss that I had feared.


 hey sis .........I am so happy to finally see you back on just so I know you are ok ........have been thinking about you alot ........How is your Mom doing?????? This has to be so hard for her ........I do know what it is like to bury your child and it is something you never imagine having to do ......and one of the hardest things to do ..Please give her my love and Dad abig hugg and you my sis a bigger one and know that we are here for you always ........God Bless ........Lyn


 Sis .......getting there lol........they have moved on to there own place but not before my sores had a chance to break out ,,,,I have one just under my eye and I was so scared yesterday all I could do was cry..never have I had one of these as painful as this one is ........I had to cancel Howie's birthday dinner last night but I am surely blessed as he knows I would not have done that unless not good at all ............Your Mom is one of the most strongest women I have come to know (thru u) and it isnt easy as I said to bury your young .....thats not how the grand scheme of life is suppossed to be ya know ....my son was 6 yrs old when he was taken home .......I just think of him up there watching over Mommy.....thats my comfort .......Yak to you later sis give Dad my luv and huggs please amd Mom too ..........God Bless you sis and stay well ........LYN


 Thanks Lynn and Terri. Lyn . . . how sad sis. I'm so sorry about your son. Even though it was a while back, I know how the pain can linger. No wonder you are such a compassionate person. Give Howie a birthday hug from Rosie! I think you were wise to give in to your limitations and I hope you are able to rest sis. Hugs and blessings for you!!"
A Question for Rosie,"Dear Rosie, Hi it is Judy. I hope you are feeling well. On the arthritis forum we have had a new member who has some questions and is not sure which forum to post on. She has several conditions. One of her conditions is Mixed connective tissue disorder. I noticed that at the bottom of your posts you list undiffirentiated connective tissue disorder. Do you know if these two conditions are similar? Sorry, but I am really curious to know what these conditions are. I am not responding well to the new treatment they have me on for psoriatric arthritis and fibromyalgia. I thought if you gave me some information on what this disease was, perhaps it might explain the horrible pain I am in. I realize this will take some time so no rush, just if you get a few extra minutes. I hope your Dad is doing well and enjoying his crafts and little outings. I keep him, you and all of your family in my prayers. God Bless you now and always, Judy/Effie","Hey Judy!! sorry . . . I haven't been on-line much lately. Computer problems. Thanks for your prayers sis . . . it means so much to me. You are sooo sweet! Yes . . . UCTD and MCTD are related. Mixed means that one has more than two connective tissue diseases (like lupus, scleroderma and RA). UCTD means that you have manifestations of these diseases but the doc can't pin-point which one(s) you have. These issues are all auto-immune (meaning the body attacks itself). You poor thing . . . sorry you are still in so much pain. Please tell me about it sis. We (one brother and I) got mom to take a three day visit to her home-town (a 6 hour drive). One of my sisters drove with her. Brother and I took turns staying with dad. He did very well and mom had a very nice time away. It seems to have been good for her. Blessings!"
Grandma Passed Away.........,"......Just wanted to let you all know I will not be around till later tonight ...........My step grandma passed away on Wednesday and I will be at the Funeral today.........She fell about a month ago and they did x rays on her .....Bowel cancer........She died at home where she was happiest....grandma was 85 and lived a full life,had all her wits about her ,and will be missed by all ..........no need to reply I am just letting you's know that I won't be on till later .........I did not want to post prior to this as there is so much tradgedy in the States right now (and has been for the last while) and so many are gone or have lost everything as we all know....please say a prayer for her ........take care all and God Bless ......Lyn,Howie and Cait","Dearest Lyn, I am deeply saddened to hear about your loss of your grandma. She must have been an amazing woman. Bowel Cancer is such a cruel disease. Yet she managed to remain where she wanted to be, at home. I only heard about this yesterday. I apologize for being late with my condolences. Judy/Effie Dear God, Please take Lyn's grandma home with you. Grant her eternal life with you. I trust that she will now feel peace, free from pain, and be able to rest comfortably now that you have called her home. Help Lyn and her family to find comfort in knowing that she is now at rest and is peacefully watching over them. We trust that she will now be safe in your ever loving care. Be with Lyn and her family while they grieve the loss of their dear grandma. Give them strength and courage to go on and keep their precious memories of this great woman close to their heart. Bless Lyn and her family, now and forever. We ask this through Jesus' name. Lord hear our prayer. Amen, Judy/Effie


 Amen to Judy's prayer Lynn So sorry things have been so chaotic for you. Blessings!

My grandmother and greatgrandmother both had and died due to Alz before they turned 65. My mom is getting worse. 2 doctors evals confirm her fading memory. Her symptoms.....took her 7 hours to drive to a friends house 30 minutes away, cannot remember anything longer than 30 minutes, cannot remember common words, is handing out money, is disoriented at times, etc. She denies a problem other than slight memory loss. I know we need to get power of attorney somehow to protect her $$ as she is literally giving it away at restaurants stores neighbors etc. We may also have to force her to live in an assisted living environment but how. We are 2,000 miles apart. Suggestions? Please help sandy","Hi and Welcome to HW sorry you have to be here but you will find great resources and people to help you out if they can ........sounds like she needs to be with family as Snowy said or go for guardianship ..........I had to do this with my Mom but here in Canad it isnt that expensive ..........I am sure it is very hard for her to admit she is having problems .........do what you can and just love her no matter what ..........Post and let us know how you are ...........Take care and God Bless ...........Lyn


 If she refuses to give you POA then try for gaudianship,but It's expensive.Is her husband still in the home?Is she near family members there?Is she on medication for AD? Can you bring her to where you live?

I think my mom has Alzheimer's,"Hi , I am new here. I just started going to the Fibro message board. I live with my parents, my dad is 80 and my mom is 68. My concern is my mom. Within the last year she has shown signs of Alz. Someof her long term memory is good. But her short term is terrible. yesterday we got our usual shipment of oranges, I put the bill where it belongs and put the oranges away. I showed her how nice they were and we had a talk about how long she has been getting them from that company. Today she saw the bill and was yelling that they billed us for something we didn't get. I didn't know how to react. Dad heard it and gently told her we did get them. She got mad and didn't belive us, I had to show her. She then got real quite and went to her room. Things like this happen everyday. My dad talked to her about getting tested for Alz and she got so upset she even mentioned divorce. I am 47 and I take care of them. I am very worried. Can some one advise, please. What kind of tests do they do, begining signs etc. Thank you, Kim","Hi Alwaysrosie, thanks for your reply i will contact them asap. god bless, kim

 You can order the bracelets from Safe Return.


 seems like your mother hes the disease the symptoms you said suggest that take her to a doctor and get it checked the doctor will prescribe medicine such as aricept to your mother Aricept is used to treat Alzheimer’s disease by preven ting the breakdown of a chemical named acetylcholine that is found in the brain. more information about the drug can be found at drugdelivery.ca


 Aricept,Exelon,& Razadyne are used for syptomes of AD,If once doesn't work another may work.Then you can add Nameda to the mix...........


 Well,I'm better on the 10mg Namenda than I was on 20mg..........I'm eating.......


 Hi Kim, I am certainly no expert on Alz, but my dad has been declining with Alz for the last few years. I believe that initially the doctor (neurologist?) attempts to rule out other causes for the memory problems. Alzhiemer's can't be diagnosed directly, it is a disease where they have to rule out other stuff and connect the dots so to speak. Dad also has done several memory tests where the doc gives list of items and the patient is asked to repeat them a few minutes later. They do several tests like that. You would do really well to contact your local Alzheimer's Association ASAP. They are a wealth of informaiton and you'll wish you had contacted them sooner. Keep us posted! Blessings!


 Great Kim!! Keep us posted! Blessings!


 Make an appointment with a Neurologist,he will test her.


 Oh Kim . . . that is great news. It's always best if the patient is her own advocate at the doc's office. I hope the doc is able to figure things out . . . and I hope it is something treatable. I have to tell you that best bit of advice after dealing with Dad's alzheimers (my first encouter with the disease) is to enjoy your mom each day exactly the way she is that day. I have spent some beautiful days sitting with Dad while mom gets a break. I am building memories which I could never have thought possible given that he has this dreadful disease. I actually feel sadened for my siblings who just don't spend time with him. Keep us posted Kim!! Blessings!


 Dear Kim, So sorry to hear of your suspicions about your Mom. My husband suffered from dementia...I guess we all call it Alzheimer's because it sounds better and people understand what you're referring to. Alzheimer's is only one of several types of dementia. Symptoms are all very similar. With regard to your Mom's short-term memory: I found it worked best not to argue with or correct my husband...or try to adjust him to reality. Just agree with what your Mom says whenever you can. (She'll forget in 3 minutes anyway.) You have to learn to lie judiciously. It reduces her anxiety and your frustration Please, please, if she asks about a deceased love one (like her mom or dad,) don't correct her. She'll experience hearing about a death as if it were the first time and probably cry. If she wants ""to go home,"" just put her in the car and drive her around the block. By the time you get home, she'll recognize the place. Or not. But it's worth a try. Get a copy of ""The 36-Hour Day"" at your library or bookstore.


 Thanks for your welcoming words, Lyn. My husband died 9 years ago...and I'm just now coming out of my funk. He was ill for about 10 years...the first 5 I was swimming in denial. I have a lot of experience I'd be happy to share. Most important is FIND A GOOD SUPPORT GROUP!!! The ID bracelet gave me a lot of peace of mind. I don't think you order thru the Alzheimer's Assn. anymore, but they can direct you to the right place. Also, we had 2 teenage sons at the time...there's not a lot of support out there for kids. It's difficult, isn't it, to restructure your relationship with someone you always looked up to...like your mother or your father or your husband. It's important to spend time meditating on that so you can reorganize your brain. Sometimes you really want to lose your temper. It helps to look at the humorous side. My husband once asked me why I had a picture of his grandfather in my living room. (Remembered Grandpa...but didn't remember me.) I thought it was cute. He also asked me to marry him almost every day. That was pretty neat.


 Thanks Snowy .......take care and God Bless .........Lyn


 Thanks for your input kunal.......how are you doing ...God Bless .Lyn


 Thanks Snowy for your input .....how are you anyways .......God Bless .....Lyn


 I didnt know you were not eating what has been going on with you ...........you know better than that ..........hope things are not too bad for you hun,is Larry still at his job and liking it.......keep me posted will you .....Take care ......God Bless .......Lyn"
How to get help?,"My mother is 78 years old and has been declining mentally for a decade. Physically she is in astoundingly good condition apart from glaucoma. She walks miles every day. She can remember in detail events from her childhood. Can tell me about the dress she wore to the first day of kindergarten etc. but can no longer differentiate between a debit card and credit card and cannot understand no matter how I try, why her credit purchases are not on her checking account statement. I originally thought she had had a stroke (she was insisting she felt someone walking beside her on one of her daily outings but every time she looked there was noone there.) When I suggested a medical eval. she physically attacked me. She hadn't struck me since I was a child. She insisted I was trying to put her in a home. She is spending (credit) enormous amounts of money on every stray cat in her neighborhood and has flooded her apt. on several occasions because she forgets to turn off the water. What happens when she forgets to turn off the stove? She forgets who she is talking to on the phone and often begins talking about me instead of to me. Can't remember the childrens names half the time. These are just several small examples of a much larger problem. My question is, how do I get this woman to the dr. before she burns down her apt building. I'm afraid for her and living with me is not an option. Thanks Ellie","It's going to be a real challenge. She won't even go back for her cancer rechecks. She had cervical cancer a number of years ago and never went back. She said the surgeon told her they had gotten it all (I lived in europe at the time and didn't even know about the surgery until it was over.) and didn't want to know anymore. My aunts will not support me in any way. She has convinced them I'm trying to have her put in a home and they say to let her be if she doesn't want to go to the doctor. I worry about my mother. Her denial that anything is wrong is also putting a financial and emotional strain on my family. (I know that sounds selfish) She's forgetting and mailing her bills before her direct deposit comes in and calls me in hysterics to come and fix it. She's never had difficulty managing money before. She's spent thousands on a cat with a heart condition but speaks of not buying her eyedrops to treat her glaucoma because it will take money she may need for the animal. I wish I could do all this for her but I simply don't have the means. All prayers are welcome. I think I'm going to need them to get her the help she needs. It took me months to get her to agree to get her cholesterol tested (and it was only at a department store promotion) and when it came up high she said it would be my fault if she had a stroke. That nothing bad happens if you don't know. It's almost like she's become a child again. And is as stubborn and unreasonable as my six year old. Thank you for your kind replies Ellie


 Hi and thanks for your kind words .yes I was laughing to but not at the time I just put my head down and smiled ...Even though my bkgd is geriatrics and I have seen so many with this DD I am still upset and pained to see both parents like this .......Dad has gotten worse real quick and that scares me as I know that if anything happens to him my Mom would die of a broken heart ........I am doing ok I have a wee bit of a cold and just got back from the pharmacy ( blew a tire so I had to fix that and put the spare on)........Jack of all trades master of none lol....I do keep my sense of humor I have to or I would be in the hospital lol.......Am going down shortly to see what they are up too ......sounds like I am running after toddlers but they really do not cause me too much concern other than the water and gas thing but I am constantly checking that and I called today to have an electric stove put in this wknd that will help with that worry........thanks for letting me vent ...I did talk to a good friend about this and had support there which is always good to have .......am having my time now lol.....I go on here to get away from all my problems and try to comfort and help others if I can so I really appreciate it when someone takes the time to comfort me ......thanks and God Bless ..Lyn


 It makes so much sense to screen calls and such I just feel so guilty if I don't answer. But the being frightened thing hit it right on the head. She is, terribly. Has been most of her life. Shes always had a difficult time making decisions, and has very little self confidence. Now what was once an annoyance is crippling her. She becomes so confused she doesn't even want to try. She has difficulty swiping her card at the wal-mart check out. I feel terrible for her. At the same time I'm so irritated that I'm digging my nails into my palms to keep from being short with her. Hence more guilt. Thank you all for your replies. You've been very helpful. It's nice to know I'm not alone in this. Ellie


 Elle 1, I used to answer EVERY call. Even if I had to run from the show, sopping wet. Not anymore. There is such a thing as sanity. Like Blue said, if it's important, the caller will leave a message. I don't have caller ID, but if I need a nap or am eating dinner (bfst, lunch) or I'm still in bed, I just DON""T answer the phone. A chronic illness requires me to get emough sleep and to avoid stress (ha ha). But really, it's easier for me because my children are all grown. I set aside two days every week plus another day when mom needs me. I live about 20 minutes from mom. I still wish I were closer sometimes. If you do decide to help your mom with doctor appointments, make sure that YOU are the one who sets the time and day so it work with your schedule. I bet your local Alzheimer Association would have some good advice for you too, Keep us posted!! Blessings!


 Thanks all. Had mom over for Thanksgiving. I didn't lose my mind, okay not all of it anyway. Three of my children, plus my mother ended up deathly ill a day to 2 days later and she now insists I gave her food poisoning. I might have actually thought it could have been a food borne illness if I hadn't eaten everything and didn't get ill. In fact out of 14 people, 4 got sick. My granddaughter was there and running a fever. I'm thinking it came from her. Good grief. Mom seems so unhappy about everything. She is totally focused on the negative. Truly I would say she complains at least 80% of the time. (no exaggeration) I try to distract her with more positive topics, it's strange to me how someone could turn a rainbow or kitten (just examples) into a topic of depression. Is this common in AD? Anyway, I wanted to thank you all for the input. You've been so helpful. I guess I just have to come to terms with the fact that I can't do it all. It's hard though. I feel so responsible for her. I'd move her in tomorrow if I didn't think it would be too hard on all of us. Her included. She seems so helpless and I wish I could fix it all for her. Someday I'll be old as well and this could be me. I want to be for her as I would wish my children to be for me. Thanks again Ellie


 Ellie ......I just had to do what Blueridge said for you too do .......I lied to my Dad to get him to the Doc told him it was for his cholesterol and blood pressure and God I hated having to lie to him.......He has an scan has been booked but the doc was convinced with the tests he did already that it is AD.My Dad is going quicker than my Mom and does the same thing as your Mom and BR Dad ....he is feeling things crawl on him ....see and hears things ......forgets the water and stove are on ......there is so much he is doing ......this saddens me as my Dad was always the one to go to for all the answers ...so intelligent.....so easy going ....now he forgets what he was talking about in less than 5 minutes at times and gets aggitated so easily . We just got back from seeing the doc and having lunch .he took his dentures out at the restaurant and put them in his shirt pocket ( it was embarrassing BUT I am able to laugh about it ) so would you if you knew my dad ...I have been sick with worry knowing that I will now have both parents to look after but I know I can and will do it .....I have had to do all Mom's banking for the last 2 yrs and make sure all bills are paid or they would not be paid .........I go over in the am and do the housework (is never dirty) but just straighten up and fold laundry get the food out and ready for supper ..then I just have to microwave it at 5 for them .........then I go back around 7 and get mom's legs rubbed and dress her for bed and I do pericare if she has not had her bath ......My hubby will help out my Dad as much as Dad will let him lol........Our daughter Cait comes over to help as well .....I hope you can find a way to get her to the doc's w/o to much of a problem...Please keep us posted on how you are making out.....my thoughts and prayer's are with you ..God Bless ...Lyn


 Ellie .......ahw honey I feel your pain I really do ......she is like a child and that is this DD.........I have taken the role of parent to my Mom and Dad....nothing harder but I have to do this for them .......I am on disability so I am able to look out for them ......I spoke with a very wise and good friend last night and we talked about this and I was able to tell her how I feel after a long day with Dad and then last night Mom was flipping about things and that was hard for me to watch ..( I sent Cait home so she did not see too much of it ) I have outside support so maybe that is why it iss a bit easier for me .......Perhaps each month either ay beginning /or end when Old Age Security ( I am guessing she is on that ) the bills can all be paid out right away and then have money put aside so if she want s to spend that so be it but not thousands on a cat .........your aunts have to see what is going on or are they getting money from her too ....not accusing ....just asking .......I found out my niece went and got 3000 from Mom for a van that I did not know about but she took Mom's bank card and used it .....Mom said it was ok but she doesnt know the value of money anymore ......I can so feel your pain and if you want to talk more about this you can IM me or email me my info is all up there under my name ....God Bless and keep us posted .........Lyn


 How do you both stay sane? Oh my gosh, shes waking me up at 6am on sundays to ask me things like how to get the closed caption off her television screen. I'm half awake and trying to explain it but she doesn't catch on and apparently thinks I should hop out of bed at that time and rush right over, (she lives 45 min. away without traffic) to fix it. Her landlady has befriended her and is taking her to Dr. appts. for the Glaucoma, but her appointments can take hours. I can't take her and guarantee I'll still be home when the kids get home from school. She doesn't want to move closer. She wants to be close to my aunt who is also mid 70's, lives just a few blocks away and drives everywhere but hasn't stopped in to see my mother in over a year. My other aunt lives over an hour from my mother, is older and in worse shape than she is. I don't have any siblings in the picture. My mom and I have never been close. I tried to move her in here a few years ago but she can be physically violent, and she frightened my children. They have to come first. Her landlady has been a great help with appts. and I take her shopping, vet etc. I just don't feel like I'm doing enough. And no matter what I do it isn't enough for her anyway. My aunts don't help. I don't get out there as much as I feel i should. My 2 year old becomes extremely carsick if I go more than a few blocks so on many of my trips out to moms I listen to my poor baby screaming in the back and smell vomit the whole trip. I lose if I go and lose if I stay. How do you deal with the guilt? Does everyone feel like this? Ellie


 Ellie........Blue gave you some great input ,and I am the same I feel guilty about lots of things with my parents .............My bkgd is in geritrics so maybe this is why I am more patient ....it has got to be hard for you having to deal with this........there are many AD resources on HW for you to check out or get in touch with me and maybe I can help you out ......God Bless ........Lyn


 Thanks Rosie for you great input ..........God Bless .....Lyn


 Ellie I would assume the sickness came from your GD not your cooking ..lol.......sorry not laughing at you but I could just picture my Dad doing and saying the SAME thing that I gave him food poisoning ..he was a top chef and still likes to cook ( I was about 6 when I was taught to make raost dinners and real gravy)........I have such beautiful memories and it so hurts to see him and Mom like this ,.........Mom gets depressed about everything as well I am thinking it is the AD...and hun most times they are helpless ........we have switched roles .......we are the parent(caregiver) and they the child ..........God Bless you for doing what you are ,even though I know it is taking it's toll ........Be well and know we are in your corner ........God Bless .....Lyn"
Old age or Alzheimers?,"about a year and half ago, my grandmother (my only living relative on my mom's side) moved in with me, my husband and kids. My grandfather died leaving my gma to fend for herself in Missouri. She is legally blind with Macular Degeneration so I am now her POA and patient advocate. Just recently I've notice her doing odd little things but I'm not sure if it's because of her age which is 86 or if it's something more serious. Here's a little background since she has moved in with us. June of 2004 we moved her here, in February of 2005 she was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in her bladder. She went thru chemo and radiation with flying colors and is now cancer free. She also has an Aortic Abdominal Anuerysm (sp?) which they will do nothing about because it's not that serious yet. She is fairly healthy now with a small problem with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. For being mostly blind she is very active and doesn't like to sit around. I just hope that I'm that active at her age! Well like I said, I have been noticing things more and more that seems odd. I will be in another room and I will hear her talk to herself and she denies doing it or she will talk at the tv. She also has these emotional ""meltdowns"" from time to time though it seems to be getting more frequent. She's got the idea in her head that my 10 year old daughter doesn't like her and will even tell her this which makes my daughter cry because she doesn't know what she is doing wrong. She has never been physical with anyone though. She gets forgetful of sometimes everyday words and she always misplacing things in her room. I've come learn her hiding spots very well by now. So I am not sure if these things are an indication of anything more important. I know that in the 1 1/2 years she had alot to deal with....losing her husband of 50+ years, moving out of state and in with us and getting cancer. I am trying to supportive as possible but it's kind of breaking my heart because I've never had to deal with something like this and I don't like what she is doing(probably unintentional) toward my daughter. So any ideas or suggestion?","I thought of that but she gets offended if I suggest so much as having a hearing test (which she is losing some of her hearing) because I think to her, she refuses to believe that anything is going on with her that is age related. In her mind, it's bad enough losing her sight. I did state her age, she's 86. Thanks


 Thanks so much Lyn, I just sent you an email :)


 I suggest you make an appointment with a Neurologist for her.He can test her.How old is she,you did not say?


 Sherry .....I had to tell a little white lie to my Dad to get him to the doctor........he is booked for a cat scan this week but I and doc believe he has AD........He had started doing some of the things you are talking about and then too denying it ...he is 70 yr old.........I am already the caregiver for my Mom and now it looks like I will need to be there for my dad.........If possible ( and I know your helth is not the best ) could you do a wee journal of some of the ""odd things "" she is doing and then take them to your doc and ask his opinion only based on that and then you may have to tell her she needs to go to doc for routine tests or something of the kind to have her checked out ......please get in touch with me ............I will try to help you as much as possible ........God Bless You for being there for her..........Lyn..BTW I have some great sites for Alzheimer's info from HW resources


 Sherry.....Just gort your email and I am sending you one now .......i hope it helps ........remember I am here for you I know how difficult and painful this is .........God Bless ......Lyn"
my father-in-law died @68.,"i am not new as i post on the irritable bowel syndrome. my father-in-law just died tuesday. he started with the symptoms of alzheimer's @ age 55. he had slowly progressed to the point where he could do nothing for himself but lay in bed. it is such a heart-breaking disease. he developed pneumonia and that's what he died of. a majority of dementia patients usually die from complications of pneumonia. we know he is in a better place since he had absolutely no quality of life. it's not fair. i am a social worker in a nursing home so i am around it all the time. it is just so sad. it's very hard when they don't know who you are anymore. the best way to approach them and talk to them is to be at their level and where they are. my father-in-law used to call me ""bill"" and would always ask what i was doing or where i had been. i would always go along with him and talk to him like i was ""bill"". it's very heartwrenching but when you go to their level, you will get more of a response from them. if anyone needs to talk, let me know. lisa","(((((Lisa))))) So sorry for your loss. God Bless to you and yours Ellie


 Lisa .......Yes I am in total agreement to let them think what they want and let them think you are who they want to a point ............you are in my thoughts and prayers ........This is a horrid DD that our loved ones live with and it affects all around them ...........I am looking after both parents ( step dad) and Mom......she fell yesterday and is now in a cast from shoulder down to elbow and her wrist is bandaged as well.......what a day for us both ...........thanks for your input ....God Bless .......Lyn


 Hi Sportsfanatic, So sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing your technigue on how to manage some of the communication problems. I have the same experience with my dad. He introduces me as his mother (I'm his daughter), but I don't correct him either. We can still enjoy spending time together and I do appreciate every happy moment there is. Lyn . . . OH NO! You just didn't need that and neither did your mother. I hope things go better for you this week. Blessings!!


 I am sorry to hear about your father in law Lisa. I like the way you say that you spoke with with him. he thought that you were Bill,so you were Bill. I think that is good advice,I am going to try and respond in a similer way with my sister. Thankyou. Sue


 sorry for your loss you are in my thoughts and prayers!!! take care sandra xxxx


 Hi Lisa, I was browsing through the recent threads when I saw your name here. I just wanted to add my condolenses to you and your family. You are in my thoughts."
Fruit and vegetable consumption and memory loss in the elderly,"From an online news service: Newswise — One of the largest studies of its kind in the nation is finding a link between fruit and vegetable consumption and memory loss in the elderly. Investigators from the Cache County Study on Memory, Health and Aging based at Utah State University are researching this, as well as asking questions such as will cholesterol-reducing drugs protect people from cognitive decline and are they at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s if they have diabetes? “We found that the group with the highest intake of fruits and vegetables scored better on the memory test than the group with the lowest intake,” said Heidi Wengreen, a lead investigator on a study of the relation between fruit and vegetable consumption and cognitive function in the elderly. “It appears that higher intake of fruits and vegetables may protect against memory loss in older adults.” Wengreen said this study is the first of its kind specifically geared to dementia prevention. Wengreen’s research involved analysis of data collected from more than 5,000 Cache County seniors, each of whom completed a standardized memory test up to four times over an eight-year period and answered detailed questions about personal dietary habits. One of the largest studies of its kind, the Cache County Study on Memory, Health and Aging is a collaborative effort between researchers at Utah State, Duke University, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington. Started in 1995, the study has followed a large group of Cache County, Utah, senior citizens, investigating a wide range of health, lifestyle and environmental factors that may influence aging and memory. Other Cache County Study findings revealed that men with diabetes may be at increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease but not women diabetics, the combined use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antioxidant supplements can prevent cognitive decline, and use of statin drugs does not influence cognitive performance. This information was presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on Prevention of Dementia in Washington, D.C. Study project manager Nancy Sassano of USU’s Center for Epidemiologic Studies said the continued participation of such a large number of Cache County residents has allowed the project to make significant contributions to scientific knowledge about Alzheimer’s disease, memory and aging. Findings have been published in more than 30 professional journals and presented at numerous national and international conferences. “Our study participants really deserve a lot of thanks,” she said.","Thanks for your input , I heard this myself or very close to this on another show on television........God Bless and Be well .........Lyn


 I've eaten well all my life,just like we are supposed to.But I got AD anyway. All the what Ifs & ""we think"" is clap trap.If we believed all that I'd be the tooth fairy.


 Thanks for sharing Bevhea, It would make sense that foods so loaded with vitamins etc. would be beneficial. Another GREAT reason for me to eat more fresh fruits and vegies. Thanks!! Blessings!"
OUR 36-hour day,"Hi again everyone......for those of you who read that book they're probably familiar with the topics it addresses,for those of you who are not it said on the cover :for family members of Alzheimer patients, other dementing illnesses and memory loss later in life...... My mother has some sort of dementia which i hope is reversible or at least gonna get better........everyday is a new experience,,,,,.... Back to the book ""The 36-hour day"" it gave me some pointers, things i wasn't aware of,,,,,,But every human is different.......some tricks in the book work,others don't....we acknowlegde every minor improvement, we sit back and look.....every setback on the other hand is really depressing for the two of us.....yes she is mom is aware of her deteriorating memory and mental capabilities..... So how about we share day to day experiences, new tricks,,,,,,,,i tried a couple i read in the book, some i made up......... e.g. the book said involve them in preparing a meal,,,,,,,now mom was a great cook,,,, i used that as a memory trick,,,,being a mediocre cook myself i asked her about a pasta recipe, nothing too complicated,,,, she stumbled a bit but then she got it. most of it....... e.g we work on reading a bit everyday, i was not aware that was becoming difficult,,,,,i knew it by accident.......i got her a prayer book, asked her to read a praye, i got one i knew she knew by heart (cheating? still a memory trick and reading all in one),,,,,,,she was starting to get really frustrated, so you might wanna take care when you do that,,,,,,,lines tend to cross over,,,,,,,,i kept my finger on the word i wanted her to read all the while keeping the next line covered with a piece of paper.... and finally we keep a log book in our heads, when we go to bed at night we try to count where we got better and plan the next day's project....... P.S. if the patient has progressive dementia, Alzheimer sort of thing i don't know if these tactics will work, they might do more harm than good....again every human is different, his illness, his life, spirit......etc. REALLY looking forward to hearing tips from you,,,,,,,,I'm afraid i'll run out of those eventually.... Thanks everyone XXXXXXXX","Thanks for this thread Snowden. One thing I do with my sister is to sit down with different types of craft ideas,quilling,glass painting(although the set I have is actuely plastic lol) I start off painting or whatever and then I will say somthing like ""oh I am no good at this,(usuely a fact lol)do you have an idea on how I should do this or what colour should this be?"" My sister used to be a very talented Artist so somtimes it can be very rewarding to see her take part in these activitys,even if it is only for a few moments before she becomes confused all over again. We were out walking in the park the other day and she was commenting on the beautiful coloured leaves that had fallen from the trees,and she was picking one or two up. I think that is the Artist still within her struggling to get out. Lynne... we also visit a wednesday Market. Stella enjoys looking around at the antiques and book stalls.


 Lyn,,,,Bag Lady.....thank you bothe very much for your replies.....please do keep it coming.... Lyn, mother is in a wheelchair and sensitive about it so going out isn't an option but the jigsaw puzzle idea is fun, i also found out she liked dominos........she liked card games but she's not that articulate yet to manage one....i hope she'll be soon Bag lady: I know what you mean about your artistic sister,,,mother LOVED her work, and since we're both doctors so i go to her with problems from MY WORK and ask her what she thinks, what i should do......I sometimes really need her answer and they are really good........I ask her for advice as a WOMAN,,,,she likes that, she's still one She had a flu the past couple of days so i didn't try to push things but i found out something: although she's not that talkative (very silent acually the past two days) she doesn't want to be left alone even if i'm sitting in the next chair, she thinks i'm ignoring her if i'm on the phone for too long, SO TOUCHING works wonders, foot massages....etc. There's a plus in foot and arm massage: it keeps her aware of her limbs......last week i asked which foot i was touching she said ""right"" (correct answer) then i started on the left and asked which foot was it again she said ""right"" i laughed and pretended she was making a joke,,,Then i slid my hand up her leg, told her to look at he ""LEFT SIDE"" , she got it right after a couple of times.......so i try to keep her aware of different body parts.....simple yet i think is important......... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


 Dad and I do small jigsaw puzzles too. He really can't place the pieces in the right spot except occassionally, but when I find a piece, I leave it sticking up a bit and he loves to snap it into place. When the puzzle is complete I slide it onto a piece of waxed paper and have Dad grout it. LOL . . . we use Elmer's type glue and squirt it all over the completed puzzle and he uses a trowel (kitchen tool w/flat blade) and he works reall hard at getting it all smoothed out and into the cracks. It dries clear and then we hang it on the wall. We've got a huge collection and he loves showing people when they come to visit. He also likes to paint, so I have a big supply of popsicle sticks (big and small) and I make things for him to paint. He will spend lots of time doing the painting and he really works hard at it. He shows everyone his huge collection of crafts. Great string!!! Blessings!


 Great Idea Sis ........am going to give that one a try for sure .......how are you and the family doing ???? My thoughts and prayer's are with you always ........God Bless ..Lyn


 In the good weather I took Mom out to her garden it was her pride and joy.........another thing we did was make all kinds of collages of the family coming up with 6 generations of peeps pics.........Mom loves to cook as well but has forgotten most of it but I still will try and do it with her.................plenty times food is really REALLY salty but I eat it anyways lol........she loves to go to Wednesday market just to look at things so off we go with her walker ............another thing to try is jigsaw puzzles ....not too hard at first but she likes them and we do other crafts as well ............great thread........God Bless .....Lyn


 BL.........I am so glad you are doing these things as well with Stella .........It would have made my day to hear her comments on the colours of the leaves,.......that is the perfect way to get her involved in the painting with you ........may have to borrow that idea ....lol........Mom loves the antiques and the books always looking for Danielle Steele ( although I do think she has triples of all her books already ) as well she loves the veggie vendors ......she will tell them their prices are too high lol,and I just carry on with her ...........lately she is into shopping I have no idea where that comes from as she has never been one for going into crowded stores (nor am I have A/P disorder),,,,,,,but we are getting thru it I think it takes my mind off my anxiety when I have to keep her in line .......or we just go for rides anywhere in the country looking at the scenery.......God Bless you hun for all you do for Stella ............Take care and yak soon .........We are here for you .........Lyn


 Snowden.......so glad you have found some great ways to interact with your Mom......and keeping her mind active is great as you know ........my Mom was not a person who gave hugs or showed emotional feelings very often when growing up but she does now........when she feels like it lol......I rub my Mom's legs every night for her as she had some clotting going on I was told by her doc this would help ......she likes it and it gives me the chance to spend ""our time"" together at night prior to her going to bed .........I just recectly flipped out on her doctor here in town as I found out he was giving her Ativan to take ,..........A big no no for AD peeps as you no doubt know yourself ......hope you keep finding things to do together as well ........God Bless .........Lyn


 OH!! Something else which has been a big help. Dad will ask the same question over and over and he'll worry about what day it is or when mom is getting back etc. I use a small sheet of paper and write a very simple message for him. Such as ""Mom will be back at 2:00. Please wait here"". He takes the paper and reads the message out loud about three times and then puts it in his wallet and takes it out repeatedly . . . but he stops fretting over it. It often has a great calming affect on him. Blessings!"
Aricept / Diarrhea,Does anyone have any suggestions regarding treatments that work to reduce or eliminate diarrhea that occurs when taking Aricept?,"My Mom had the same problem but it did subside after about 3 to 4 weeks as Snowy has said .....I find that the Assurance was better as well .................By the way I would really like to welcome you to HW we have a great support system here with peeps that do know what you are going thru .......Are you the caregiver for your Mom???......Please post often so we can get to know you and you us ....Hope you had a great Christmas ..........God Bless ....Lyn........The resources at the side in yellow are great for answering some questions as well ........Glad to have you aboard ....Lyn


 When I first went on Aricept I had that problem.I went out & bought depend pull ups.Assurace is better though.The diahrea lasts a month or so,then it stopped........"
can anyone shed light on whats happening?,"An update.... Well, after waiting for hours in the Aand E department at the hospital today(There had been a car accident so staff very busy) my sister Stella finaly did get seen by a Doctor and a realy nice nurse. They said that Stella should have had a water sample tested yesterday and they don't know why she hadn't. Anyway, it turns out that she has got a water infection and she has been given antibiotics. They have said that the siezure type symptoms may have been brought on by the infection but they dont know for sure. They said to take her back straight away if she gets the other symptoms of rolling eyes etc again. She also had some blood tests taken and they had the results in about an hour.They said that they were fine. I wasn't there so I am going to ask my neice if one of those tests was to check for B12 levels because I know that Stella has been low on that before,but it seems that the doctors can never make up there minds as to if she needs more B12 injections or not. I am due to go with Stella for her apointment with the consultant that she sees about her dementia on the 22nd November and the nurse suggested that we ask for Stella to have another brain scan,the same as she had in 2001. Does anyone know the name of the brain scan it is similer sounding I think to the ECG that you have to check the heart,but I cant remember the name of it. I will also nag them about the B12. Ok, Stellas husband He is actuely getting carers alowance for supposedly looking after Stella. I have spoken with the social worker about my concerns that he can not cope with looking after himself let alone Stella(he is an alcoholic) I have told her everything about how he treats Stella,how he shouted at her for blocking the toilet with kitchen paper(she wont put tissue down the toilet now) I have told her how everytime I go to pick up Stella to bring her here for the day she always says ""Oh I am glad to get out of there"" She says the same to my other sisters when they go to pick her up too. I am just always told that they and the Doctor have made a note of our concerns but there is nothing that they can do unless they see abuse or the result of abuse for themselves. We were promised that although Stella is not too keen on the idea,that they were going to try and encourage her to visit a day centre a couple of days a week. But my niece Marie has said that when the social worker calls around on her thurday afternoon visit(every other week) that still nothing has been done and they havnt even mentioned it to Stellas husband. I will be calling the social worker on Monday morning ""again"" to see what she has to say about it all. Sorry for waffling","Hello Lyn, thankyou for your reply. Usualy Stella just has the one tablet to take in the evening and surprisingly that is the one thing that her husband does do for her. Stellas daughter Marie is still living at home and she generaly does everything else for stella. it depends what mood.Stellas husband is in to be honest.Sometimes when I have gone to pick Stella up he has made sure that Stella has had a bath and her hair is combed etc,but at other times it's obvious that he hasn't done these things for her. If marie is there she will do it but she has recently started at collage and she works part time so it is obviously becoming more difficult for her to do everything that needs to be done. And she is now 26 and engaged so she cant be expected to be there forever. It's the changable moods of Stella's husband that makes things so difficult realy because one minuete he has us thinking ""oh maybe he isnt so bad and he is trying"" but the next minuet he does somthing so rediculous and stupid in his treatment of Stella that all we want is to get her out of there. Yes I think it is the EEG. Stella had that in 2001 and I think it was that test that showed that there was a problem. I am going to ask the consultant when we see him if Stella can have another one. When Stella went to the hospital yesterday she had a water sample tested(somthing they had failed to do the day before) She has a water infection. The nurse said that it is possable that Stella's seizure problems were due to the infection but they dont know for sure. Thanks again Lyn


 UTI makes us with AD very agitated & downright grumpy.Any type of infection causes problems.What medication is she on???


 Snowylynne... Stella takes Aricept (sp) for her dementia. And at the moment she is on the antibiotics for the water infection but I am not sure what they are called. She is doing better,eating and not sleeping so much and so far no more of the weird seizure type symptoms. Geeve... Thanks for the tip about the cranberry capsules. I know that Stella has taken them in the past but she tends to enjoy drinking the juice so I will get her some of that. I am going to suggest to my niece that she also gets some Acidophilus tablets to help put back the friendly bacteria that the antibiotics will probably kill off. I spoke with the social worker and she has said that because there are certain guidlines that she has to follow it is difficult for her to do anything about the home situation. She said if she saw My sister being abused or saw evidance of abuse then she would beable to do somthing. But as things stand,she says she cant do anything about Stella's husband shouting or dealing with Stella with impatience. she also said that none of us can guarantee that we would be aware if Stella was ill in the night because we would be asleep,so in the same way she cant say to Mick that he isnt aware enough. The only thing she can do she said is to gain his trust and explain to him how important all these things are. I was surprised to be told by the social worker that he(my sisters husband) actuely has phoned her up a couple of times and has admitted that things are getting difficult to cope with at home for him. The day centre was mentioned to him again and aparently this time he didnt say no. I think that he is coming around to the idea of someone coming into the home more to help out too. Sometime soon,the sociel worker will be coming out with myself and Stella and we will go for lunch. I think it is a good idea because I think that I will pick up some tips on how to deal with certain situations that may arise when I am out and about with Stella,especialy as she is starting to revert back to child like behaviour when eating and going to the bathroom etc. I dont like asking her or showing her how to use a knife and fork instead of her fingers because I feel like I am patronising her and I hate that,although obviously I try not too. On a side note. I had to go into hospital today,just a small procedure nothing major. my other sister Marian got me a nice card and also one from Stella, Stella signed her own name but it was tiny writing and she spelt it wrong. Just seeing that, sort of brought home to me how much worse her symptoms are becoming and it made me feel sad. Anyway, thanks again everyone and I will keep you posted on what happens on the 22nd at the meeting with the consultant. Sue


 Snowy, Is Seroquel taken on a regular basis or can it be used 'as needed'. Dad has been having some real anxious/agitated times lately. Thanks.


 Seroquel is a drug that has to get into system as well from my understanding .......hopefuly there is something else dad can use for this Rosie .......thinking bout you ......Give Dad and Mom a big hugg and you too ....God Bless ..Lyn


 Baglady,a UTI Is called a Urinary track Infection.(or water infection as you call it.).Even a bad cold can cause problems,or pnumonia.You are right about the MMSE at 12 medocations are stopped.Except for agitation & outbursts they need to keep taking those meds.Being dehydrated can also caus UTI so see to it she had plenty to drink at all times,not when he chooses to.How is her appetite?


 Thanks Snowylynne Yes it is difficult at times getting Stella to drink enough. She can have a glass of orange squash in her hand and we still have to remind her to drink it. The trouble is that she has started getting a bit annoyed about being reminded all the time. Not much else we can do though because like you said it is very important for her to get enough to drink. Apetite wise,she will eat like a horse if it is somthing that she likes,but she is getting more and more fussy over foods lately. Did I read somewhere that with dementia the ability to taste is affected? Sue


 Lyn... Stella always likes a roast dinner too. She spends Mondays with one of our other sisters and I know she always enjos a roast dinner there. I very often also do her a roast on a Wednesday as well,but not always. She loves roast potatoes. Stella likes chocolate too, but cake is her favourite out of everything I think so we have to keep that well hidden until after dinner lol. We have found that she loves yoghurt,and that is a good, thing especialy as she has had a few rounds of antibiotics lately for her UTI's I am sorry to hear that your Dad now also has AD,that must be tough on you all. Take care Sue


 You have just reminded me of somthing I was meaning to ask SnowyLynne. Stella is on Aricept. Is alcohol a no no when taking this? I keep meaning to ask my Brother in Law and my neice about this because they are the ones that give Stella her tablets at night. I know that Stella used to enjoy a glass of cider with a meal and it would be nice to think that she still can without it being a problem. Thanks Sue


 Hey Sue ,,How are you doing today ..........God Bless .....Lyn


 Baglady,popcycles are a good source of fluids too,Carnation Instant breakfast also.They come in different flavors.


 Hello everyone. I am not sure where to start realy. My Sister was diagnosed around the age of 51-52 with an ""Alzheimers type Dementia"" She is now 55 and definatly getting worse as far as memory,social skills,bathroom habits that sort of thing. Yesterday while she was sat watching TV,she suddenly went into a type of siezure,head back,eyes rolling and her chin was sort of trembling. She was taken to hospital where after a very brief examination and some questions that for obvious reasons she couldnt answer,she was sent home. We have been told that people with Alzheimers type of problems can be prone to seizure type things but it is not the same as epelepsy(sp) Last night,she continualy kept on dozing off on the sofa and then waking up again. her daughter put her to bed. Today.... I had a call a while ago from my neice. She had recieved a call at work from My sisters husband(and a total waste of space in my opinion) aparently he couldnt wake my sister up this morning. Instead of caling someone right there and then,he left her untill 12.30 lunch time and then called my niece(his daughter) at work. She called up NHS direct who said ""why didnt he call an ambulance straight away."" My niece went home imediatly and my sister had then woken up but was very hot,shaking and crying. One of my other sisters has taken them up to the hospital again,but what are they going to say? probably the same as yesterday ""nothing we can do take her home"" My Mother in law had Alzheimers and I didnt see even a hint of the symptoms that my sister is having. my sister started to go down hill a few years ago when she had a virus(I remember she collapsed while on her way to the bathroom) and from then on she was continualy having ear infections and it was also at this time that she started getting her memory problems. I have tried to question my sisters consultant when we go for her reguler apointments about a possable connection with this virus she had a few years ago but I dont get anywhere. Somthing just isnt right somewhere and it isnt me being in denial that my sister has Alzheimers either. What do I do,what can I do? PS,if anyone thinks I am being harsh calling my brother in law a waste of space,if you new him and the way that he behaves towards my sister then you would agree with me. I have posted this in the hope that someone will be familier with the symptoms that my sister is having and maybe help me to understand what is happening and why the medical people dont seem to be giving us any answers. Thanks for reading Sue


 Hi Bag Lady .........My you do have your hands full ........I was wondering when Stella is at home WHO is in charge of her meds if she has any??? The hubby sounds like a real prize and if he is a boozer than he has no ability to look after others ........I am betting that alot of what was wrong with Stella has to do with the infections .....It is a sad reality what happens to our loved ones behind closed doors..........I do not know if you are talking about an EEG .................she should see a neurololigist or has she ........You sound like you are at aloss and rightly so .......when you do talk to someone who will listen to you TELL them to check for viral infections and the whatnot as she could very well have had this infection since she fell the first time and it is so east to mis DX peeps and say they have alzheimer's when they do not instead of checking into other sources ...we all have some memory loss ( I know I do ) I will be anxiuos to hear what they say on Monday to you ....Is there any where she can be that there is someone to look after her that is reliable ?someone that will ease some of this off of you and your niece??? I am thinking about you .........sorry .........God Bless .........Lyn


 Dear Stella, When you say ""water infection"", do you mean urinary tract infection? If so, there's a history of them in my family, and after a few myself, I started taking a cranberry capsule every day. You can get them in the vitamin aisle, and they don't cost much, and it really worked for me. Good luck. Geeve


 Thanks Snowy I was waiting for you ............The infection could cause so many problems and peeps just do not realise what it can actually do ........cranberry juice is good as a preventitive measure but she needs good medical care as well .........EEG will show the activity in the brain or the damage that may be there ........alcholilcs are moody ( my ex) and it must be downright terrifying for Stella to have to live in that environment as well ( I know what I went thru ) and I know you and her daughter are doing your best it is hard I look after my MOm and I find it is hard on me but I know she would flip if I was to put her in a home .........I hope they get this test done and things start to ease up for u and for Stella ............I will be thinking of you ............my prayers ...............God Bless ...........Lyn


 If she gets really agitated or angry Seroquel can help.I had a bad spot in Feb.& It put a stop to my anger & agitatin.Heathcare workers at the rehab hosp.hubby was in were not nice when they found out I had AD.Lie i'm adelpated or something.It took me by complete surprise as I'd never been treated like that before,threw me into a real tizzy...........I use Seroquel now asa PRN med.With my Dr blessing.


 Always rosie ususlly it is given every day in most cases,keeps the agitation down.One day I may need it every day too,who knows?


 An update I went with my sister Stella and my niece marie yesterday for the apointment with the consultant. The gist of how it went is, Stella is being sent for an MRI scan soon because she hasnt had anything done like that to check on things for years. It was decided that because Stella is so against the idea of a day centre, that Cath(mental health nurse) will increase her visits to Stella and take her out to do things that Stella enjoys. She has already taken her out for tea and cake and Stella was fine with that. Stella already spends Monday with our other sister and Wednesdays with me so that will be 4 days taken care of. If the day care issue is forced at the moment,it will only distress Stella and make the situation worse. Stella's husband has started to trust Cath the nurse so that is a big step forward. I think the next thing they are going to suggest is a night sitter for a couple nights a week to start with. This is because we have made them aware that Mick very often drinks at night so he cant be aware if Stella was to wake up or if she was ill in the night. Because of Micks behaviour and the fact that he cant cope with himself,let alone Stella,they have talked him into having a mental health nurse into the home to try and help him because they can see that he obviously has big issues of his own that they want to try and help him with. Stella only scored 13 on her last memory test I think, and she is going to be having another one soon. If she gets as low as 12 then they might take her off the Aricept meds because they say the low test results mean that it isnt doing anything for her. I voiced my concern that I have heard that some people become very anxious and even violent when Aricept is stopped. They said,if that were to happen then they would put her back on it even if it was doing nothing for her memory. They are going to speak with Mick(a meeting in the home because he wont come to the apointments) and try to explain how important it is for Stella to be looked after propery by Mick and explain how he can do that. I have warned them though,that Mick only sees what he wants to and he doesnt even seem to ever be able to see the point of view of others. He is totaly self absorbed. This is due in part to his drinking but in my opinion he has had the same atitude for as long as I have known him and thats about 35 years. We are sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place, Remove Stella from her home and she will be very very distressed,or she stays where she is with him and his attitude and that also causes anxiety. She hates it when she can not be with her daughter Marie. She follows her all over the house. Things are taking there toll on marie now as well. She collapsed at uni last week. She is trying to do a university course,work part time and look out for ""both"" parents. I asked the Doctor if he thought the strange seizure thing that Stella had could have been due to the effects of her UTI but he said he feels it is more likely due to her condition. I think this is one reason that he has ordered the MRI scan. Thats it for now,on we plod. Sue


 hanks Snowy for your input .....am having probs here with the dang weather ............hard to keep online ..........God Bless ......Lyn


 Sue ........with Mom I just keep getting her small drinks constantly and usually this gets her enough fluids........her appetite is good as well but definitely has changed,she is very open about what she refuses to eat and what she thinks of the food put in front of her ,so I do try and make what I know she will eat ....for instance if I do a turkey or roast beef then I will make up a few dinners (using the TV dinner trays) and freeze them so that I just have to pop it out of freezer and into oven or microwave .........it is a time saver for sure as well I know she will eat it and she loves chocolate so I always keep her ""aero"" bars on hand .......My Dad is different though as I said he was a chef and wants his food looking presentable (of course ) and fresh lol.........I am not sure if I had told you that he was tested and he has AD as well (he is my step dad) so I am now looking after them both ,but have hubby and daughter to help and here to come to for support and answers .......God Bless ...........Lyn


 Yes,Alzheimer's does affect taste of foods.Every day day Is different with mer,I get bored with the same foods.I'm more Into eating veggies than anything but love my Steak & Margaritas,lol.


 My Dr said I could drinl moderatly,one or two drinks a day,but i don't drink that much by any means.Once or twise a week for me....although I do like an egg nog with rum in it at nite sometimes. Also Aricept does better when taken In the morning,less agitation,sundowning.


 Hi Lyn I am fine thanks. No drama's at the moment with Stella,she has actuely seemed a lot brighter in her self since being treated for the UTI. Not sure if next week will be the same story, as Stella's daughter is going into hospital for a small operation and Stella stresses when she isnt around her. It will all be fine in the end though I am sure. How are you Lyn? Sue


 Thanks SnowyLynne. I don't think I have seen the Carnation Breakfast but I will have a look around to see if I can find them. Is it a sort of milky drink with vitamins added?"
Lyn Kyle Emerick,I read on another thread that your mom had a fall and hurt her arm. How is she today is she ok? Sue,"Hi lyn. I am glad to hear that you have some help as I can imagine how difficult everything must be for you. I wish your mom a speedy recovery with her arm Take care

 Hi Lyn. I hope that you had a nice time at the market. The one that we go to isnt all that big so it doesnt take too long to look around lol. On Wednesdays there are antiques and ornament things to look at. There is usuely books too and my sister likes to look at those. It's a shame because she says that she wants this or that book,but she just isnt capable of reading more than a sentance anymore before she loses concentration. When we got back we had lunch and then we looked through a couple of books with paintings in as she likes those. And now my sister is dozing on the sofa(we have got chilled Ibiza on the cd player) while I am typing this on my lap top. I love my lap top,I would hate to be without it now. Take care Sue

Prayer's For The Families,I would like to ask you to pray for the families of the Mining victims.......I was watching CNN thru all of this and to hear that they were at one time all alive was a good feeling and I was so happy for them and their loved ones .......hours later there was only one survivor and he is in critical condition ........Please say a prayer for them and their famililies .......Thanks all and God Bless .....Lyn,"Sorry Lyn, I have had a hard time connecting with this tragedy. I first saw it and tried to ignore it and I intentionally did not read this string. So many people (military and civilians) are having such a time of it lately. I guess I was just trying to keep my head in the sand. Father God, I am sorry that I have been unable to focus on this tragedy. I ask that the families and friends of these miners who have died will feel your Fatherly presence in their lives. I know that you are there with these good people. Father, please help each of see how much we have (instead of what we lack) and what a gift each minute of our lives are. Thanks you for allowing us to come before you and seek your love and assurance. In Jesus name. Amen


 Thanks for starting this string Lyn . . . I would want to know that people were praying for me and my loved ones if tragedy struck. I hope things are stabalizing for you. You are a real trooper!! Blessings!


 We may not know these people but they are going thru so much heartbreak and pain.......Please a thought or prayer would be helpful at this time ......God Bless ...lyn


 Thanks Sis I know I really tried to not watch this unfold as well but it just ""got"" to me........for about 3 hrs these families were told that there was only one fatality ......(one to many) and then thry were told there was only one found alive..........Major miscommunication I would say ...............We have strength in numbers with our Prayer's that is why I asked that we think/Pray for the families.............Your Prayer is lovely and filled my heart ....thanks again sis ......god Bless ......Lyn (SIS)"
New to Forum - Issues with mother,"Please, I need advice. My mother is 82 and is exhibiting problem behavior. My sister and I had to move her from her apartment to assisted living and I feel very guilty about limiting mymother's independence which she values above everything. She was seeing people in her apartment and claiming men were coming through her door even with a dead bolt lock installed. We moved her from one apartment in the building to another and she developed another story about men in her apartment. She claimed people would come in and sleep on her sofa. Finally, she stopped eating properly and forgot to take her medication. She went into the hospital because of dehydration. In an attempt to keep her in her apartment, I hired a person to stay with her overnight and arranged for an emergency call service that could be activated by pressing a button that was positioned around her neck. She couldn't understand how to use it. She was however very sharp about how much money she had or didn't have. I made sure she had enough all the time and would buy her anything she asked for. As a result of her lack of ability to take care of herself and the many times she had to go to the hospital we decided to move her to assisted living. I live 200 miles away and my sister 500 miles. My sister is destitute and I am the only one in the family that canpay for anything. We found a place near the town she was living in for what I could afford and her social security. They take really good care of her physically but she remains very unhappy as her hallucinations are continuuing. She blames her problems on the place and does not recognize that it is a problem with herself. Whenever I call her, she pleads for me to mover her and then she threatens to leave. I make sure she has food she likes beyond what they give her there. Because of distance, I can only visit her once a month. During my visits I take her out for meals and shopping. She tells me wild stories about walls opening up in her room and strange lights. Also staircases behind the wall that opens up. I feel so bad about her misery I can't sleep at night. When she talks about other things she is quite understandable and coherent. She can be highly manipulative and nasty. She has no inhibition about saying hurtful things. What can I do?","Hi Marty and Welcome ..........You do sound very caring and concerened about your Mom .....I think you have made the right decision and I would check into what Rosie had to say as well .......I look after parents at home and I know with all that is going on in my health I wont be able to do it for too much longer............Your Mom I am sure doesnt mean to be miserable or mean it is part of this DD .......Hallucinations go hand in hand as well ......if you have a few minutes there are resources at the side of this page that may help you out .........Know that you are not alone and we do know what you are talking about ......I will bump up some posts for you ok .......take care and please post again .........God Bless ......Lyn


 Marty ...Just wondering how you are making out ...God Bless....... .Lyn


 Hi and Welcome to HW........ You will find that most on this forum (at least 3 or 4 ) I can think of off the top of my head are retired nurses or worked in the HC feild in some capacity..........I for one had own retirement home for yrs till sickness took me from it .......At the side in yellow is resources for this DD and they have helped me out quite a lot.........We have fantastic support groups, here in Canada as well (Ontario) and this site has been a God send for me ......I look after both parents Mom and my step Dad and it is a very rewarding ,yet sometimes frustrating thing to have to do as I have NO support from my siblings at all and they all live here in town .....Go fiqure........I am really glad you found us here and hope to see more of your posts in the future.............I believe you will find so much care support and empathy here..........I know I have over the last yr.......God Bless and be well ......BTW.....we do have a National (constantly updated) registry of AD peeps and they do have bracelets as well that you are able to purchase for your loved ones ......Glad to have you aboard .........God Bless ....Lyn


 Hi Marty, What are the chances of watching for an opening in a suitable assisted living place nearby your home? I'm sure for some reason that was not a good option, but if your sis is 500 miles away and you are the only one visiting than it makes sense to have her close to you. It sounds to me like she was unhappy in her apartment too and had lots of problems there, so I wouldn't use your energy feeling bad about the decision if you are convinced that the assisted living staff is treating her well and sounds like they are. I am very interested in this situation as my dad is still able to live at home with mom, but I dread the day that it becomes necessary to move him to a home. Right now my siblings and I are trying to get over to moms about 3-4 times a week to give her a break. You sound like a very caring person. Blessings!


 Welcome.I agree bringing her near you is a good idea,then you can get her to a Neurologist to test her.Then be put on medication,esp.for the hallucinations.You can keep a close eye on her too.


 My prayers are with you, Marty! Has it been possible for you to take your mother to her family doctor for a thorough physical examination (to rule out any possible physical causes of her hallucinations), be referred to a neurologist for a thorough neurological examination (to determine whether she displays the warning signs of Alzheimer's)? Is the assisted living center where she resides, a secured building with special security entrance/exit codes? Are her medications administered by someone other than herself (such as a nursing staff member at the assisted living center)? Since your mother appears very lucid as to her finances, she may probably recall short sequences of numbers, such as the entrance/exit codes. Concern for the possibility that she may wander is very much a top priority. There are special bracelets that she could wear, that would identify her, in case she wanders. I am not certain if any have ""tracking devices"" to know where she is at all times. As a registered nurse with over 20 years of experience in long-term care, I am now a ""new baby"" in the role of care for my 81 year-old mother (who needs to be assessed/evaluated, but denies she has any need!!!). I am her power of attorney for healthcare, and live about 100 miles from her. No other siblings survive. Her personality changes are of greatest concern, and I have found an excellent assisted living facility in the city where I reside. She is very aware of her surroundings, however, I believe the denial is probably her fear of losing independent living. Do you have an Alzheimer's support group in your area. Ours is EXCEPTIONALLY WONDERFUL. I know that if my daughter and I go to Mom's and take her to the car, she may show great resistance, and the neighbors will wonder what in the world is happening. Mother does not share important details (such as the name of her current doctor, etc.). I wish you well, and I'll check this site for any concerns you may have. Sincerely, alexandriacush@netscape.net


 Marty ..........have been wondering about you and hoping things are getting better for you and your Mom .......It would be great if it could be done where she is closer to you .........PLEASE do not take the anger and the pain she is exibiting as YOUR fault it is not ......it is this DD........it robs us of our loved ones for sure .........Please post and let us know how you are ........there are a few on here waiting to hear about how things are going ..........God Bless ........Lyn"

Volunteering with Alzheimer's patients,"Hello. I usually post in the chronic pain forum. I do not have a family member or friend with Alzheimer's, but I am now doing volunteer work with Alzheimer's patients, which has been incredibly rewarding but also difficult at times. I want to ask if any of you have any suggestions about how best to communicate with these beautiful people who have been afflicted with Alzheimer's. I volunteer with my two certified therapy dogs at local nursing homes and hospitals that care for Alzheimer's patients. My dogs recently received their certification, and it is often magical watching them interact with the residents. It's amazing because they somehow know who wants to see them and who does not. Some of the residents recognize that they are dogs and want to cuddle with them and stroke their incredibly soft fur. When my dogs lightly kiss their faces, they often giggle with laughter. Interestingly, the residents seem to be communicating with my dogs with complete ease. When I ask them questions, however, they sometimes have difficulty replying. Often, the residents are rocking in chairs, and we go down the line and visit each person individually. When they see the dogs, their faces almost always light up. I want to ask all of you if you have any suggestions about how best to communicate with the Alzheimer's patients I visit. Now, if I see that a person is having difficulty replying, I just tell them a little about my dog, such as his name or favorite food. Also, at times, I've found that no spoken words are needed with some patients. They get such joy and love when they're cuddling with my dogs, and that's often the best medicine. To all of you currently dealing with Alzheimer's in your life, I am sending lots of warm thoughts and prayers your way. I know that I can only make a very tiny difference in the lives of the patients I visit, but if I help one person feel better, I've accomplished what I set out to do. Thank you in advance for any input. Kindly, Ali","I look after my parents and they have a dog that they love and enjoy.......I was always a hugger to my patients as well in the NH or retirement homes.........It was not often that I saw family come to see their loved ones .......it was sometimes quite sad..........thanks for you beautiful and heartwarming post .......God Bless..........Lyn


 Ali, it's a pleasure to meet you and an honor. I've met dog people who've come into the Nursing Home where I used to work, and I've seen that magic that you're talking about . I would love to see pictures of your dogs. It's such a wonderful self-less thing that you are doing, and all the more so with your CFS. I think, from my own personal experience, that what these folks need most, is a loving physical touch. I'm afraid in Nursing Homes, there is little or none of this.That is the one thing they get so very little or any of, unless they have empathetic family visiting. Just a hand on their shoulder or holding a hand, gently letting them know you're there. Gentle Hugs are great. I used to just ""hold"" them. And only God knows sometimes what power there is in that. Just to be held. With aphasia, words are hard to understand or to speak, if at all, but the loving touch of another caring human is something that has even kept premie babies alive. God Bless you Ali and I'm sure the Pros on this board will be able to share a lot more with you. I'd love to see ya's at work."
I'm new at this,"Hi, I just found out recently that my dad has Alzheimer's Disease. He is only 67. He was diagnosed about 2 months ago, but things seem to be progressing quickly. He is getting ready to retire, because work has become to much for him. It is so sad to see someone you love go through this. I also worry so much about my mom. She is left with so much responsibility. How long do most people live with Alzheimer's?","Bump


 I help where I can.Many people think once you have been diagnosed with AD you don't know anything,well If It's caught in the VERY begining like mine was,I can argue.lol.


 We know that is not the case with you right Snowy...(lyn's Hubby)


 I first want to Welcome you to HW......as for the lifespan of those with AD I honestly dont think there is a set amount of time they live .........Snowy will no doubt be able to help you out with this one better than I .......My Mom has been with AD for a few yrs now and my step Dad just started going downhill real quick the last few months ........it is hard yes but we are here for support and honest empathy .........Keep posting and glad you found us .............in the yellow box at side there are resources that you are able to check out .......take care and God Bless.........Lyn


 Welcome to the forum.A friend of mine whose wife has AD,said once he accepted he behaviour ,everything was better.Denial is what causes the problems.Learn everything you can about AD.I have the disease too,I've accepted it & just keep loiving.


 Well some do swear we can't do anything,lol.


 Thank you..................."
How can I talk to my grandpa?,"Hi, First let me say I am grateful for this forum and looking forward to any suggestions! Tonight I went out with my grandparents and cousin. We were all helping my young cousin prepare for a school yardsale. Everything was fine until suddenly my grandpa who has alzheimers suddenly became very angry. He did not want my grandma to help. He kept saying over and over that she is very sick and should not be doing anything. My grandma insisted she was fine but he INSISTED to the point where it became yelling around kids. It was very upsetting for us all. We tried our best to handle the situation but it was very hard! I didn't know what to do in the moment. At first I told my cousin not to worry and that we should try not to pay attention to his behavior. But he continued on this vein for 15 minutes loudly before we could finish what we were doing. At one point I went up to him and calmly explained to him that grandma was ok and that we would be finished in a few minutes. He was stuck on his belief that she was not fine. He would not listen to reason. There were other kids around and although my grandma kept reassuring him he refused to listen to her. Is there any way to communicate with someone who has alzheimers to keep them calm? We tried the honest approach but he did not believe us. I tried praying and I tried to rub his arm to calm him down but as I was walking away he grabbed my arm and if I had not been out of arms reach it could have easily become physically violent. Although I know he couldn't hurt me I am concerned because if he gets mad like that when he's home alone with my grandma he could hurt her. I really need some ideas on how to communicate. We tried listening to him. We were patient and calm but it did not work. We were clear that we would be done by 5:30. I even suggested he could wait in the car until we finished but that just seemed to make him madder. And then he began berating my cousin saying he should do this on his own, etc. My cousin was strong and did not ""fight"" with grandpa. He just kept telling him we were almost done. I have never been around my grandpa during an episode. I was struck by how sudden it all happened. We had been there for a half an hour doing everything fine and calmly and happy before he suddenly started complaining. I would appreciate any suggestions! Thank you, Caroline carolinerocks@yahoo.com","when an individual has alzheimer's they have a hard time understanding us or know what is going on. you need to be at their level and put yourself in their position. it's very hard but you will communicate better with them when you do this. if he thinks that your grandma is ill, then say ""ok, maybe we will let her rest and we will all work together on this"" and let him help with assistance. they are not in the same world as us and by trying to tell him grandma is ok-he does not understand. they get angry with us if we try telling them different. if he calls you by another name, then you need to be that person. i hope that helps. if you have anymore questions let me know. take care! lisa


 Hello Caroline and welcome. I agree that this board is a great place to come to. I have picked up some very helpful tips on here that I can use when I am with my sister who has Dementia.She is only 55. I can imagine how tough for you all that day at the yard sale must have been. I agree with Lyn that maybe one way to have calmed your Grandpa down would be for your Grandma to say somthing like ""oh well maybe I should sit down for a while,will you sit with me?"" and then ""hopefuly"" after a few minuets your grandpa would calm down and your grandma would be able to help with the sale again. At the same time your Grandma could be asking Grandpa for advice such as ""where shall we put this?"" or ""could you put this on that table for me?"" I know myself that even then things might not go as we hope and you end up just muddling through to the best of your abilty. Unfortunatly thats all you can do. Thats just my opinion though as I am definatly no expert. I can't remember where I read it now but one example of a conversation with someone with AD realy made me think,it went somthing like this...... Patient in a panic..... ""There is a monster behind the curtain,help!"" Carer looks behind the curtain and says... ""Oh I am sorry that you got frightened but it's ok now because it looks like the monster has gone now"" I think that many of us would probably have reacted differently and said somthing like this... ""No there is no Monster, there cant have been"" The trouble with that reaction is that the person with AD will probably get more frustated and frightened because they havn't been believed. I feel for you and your situation with your grandpa. Sue


 Just wondering how you are all doing lately with the saeson rush and all the goodies to bake ..........God Bless ........Lyn


 Hey sis that is a really good idea ......I am going to borrow that one from you for sure .........How is Dad and Mom thru all the holiday rushing about and healthwise ??.......lots of love and huggs to all and all the best to you's for a Warm Loving and Healthy and Happy Christmas filled with the love of family and friends ......and to a prosperous New Year ..........Love ya sis.........God Bless .....Lyn.....Sure hope you are NOT overdoing it either as you do not need to be sicker or I will have to come there and kick butt lol........Lyn


 Hey Lynn . . . thanks for the super holiday greeting!!! Back at you sis!!! Dad is doing ok. He actually made it through our family Christmas party and did really well. He is very confused lately, more so than usual, so I hope he isn't taking another nose-dive. I hope the note thing works as well for your mom as it does for dad. No . . . I'm not overdoing it. I traded holday decorating fror cookies!! My only Christmas decoration is a big poinsettia and Christmas cards. But, I did bake 5 kinds of cookis this year . I'm having my four adult children, spouses and grandkids for Christmas dinner, but I am making some easy stuff. I hope you are being careful with your energy as well sis!! Merry Christmas and Blessings!


 Caroline ...First let me Welcome you to HW .........it sounds like it was a really difficult situation to be in .......personally I prob would have had grandma sit down for a few minutes and then her say something like ""yes thanks I do feel a bit better"" I do not condone lying outright to AD peeps but sometimes you have to bend to their thoughts and it is hard to do ........Does he get agitated alot and does he take meds for this?? In a way it sounds to me like he was trying to have it all be as NORMAL as possible with him as the head man making the decisions ........Just my opinion........It has got to be so hard on him as it is on you's to see him act like this ..........I look after my Mom and step dad both have AD>......this is a great place to come and I amsure there will be more posts answering yours soon....wknd sometimes are slow but do not give up we will get to you asap......in the meantime you know you are no longer alone in this..........we do know what you are talking about ......keep posting and let us know how things are going for youall.......God Bless.......Lyn


 Tell all truths to someone with AD upsets them & at times agitates them.You have to go into their world,since they are not in ours anymore.Thank goodness I'm still In this world,lol.


 I hope you have gotten some insigt into the AD world .....It is a heartbreaking one to be looking into .......God Bless .....Lyn


 Welcome to the forum Caroline!!! I'm sorry I didn't have time to read the responses to your post, but wanted to add that my dad gets stuck on a thought like that too. What I have done for him lots of times is to write a short note on a small piece of paper . . . nothing too long. My dad often wants to go find my mother when I am staying with him so she can have a few hourse away. When he starts getting too aggitated and trying to leave to go find her, I write something like: ""Mom will be back at 3:00. Please wait here."" These notes have helped tremendously. He holds it and looks at it repeatedly or if he starts complaining again I ask him to read his note. He eventually puts it in his wallet and looks at it every 10 minutes or so. Hope this helps. Blessings!


 Just wondering how all are doing and wishing you all the best for a great Christmas and better New Year......God Bless ......Lyn"
This may help you with any questions you have,During the past few months my family has been going thru the process of finding a care facility for m father who has Alzheimer’s. He was normally cared for by my mother but several months ago she passed away and now we have no choice but to place my father in the care of others. It is a decision that one person can’t make alone. We still have not found a facility that we are comfortable placing him in but I heard about a informational live chat that is being held online. It is being orchestrated by the Alzheimer’s Association and will be tomorrow on April 28 th at 8pm CDT. The link to get to the chat is http://www.alz.org/messageboards/overview04282005.asp . I will be attending this chat and I hope that some of you who are facing this decision will join me.,"I chat with others there too.......


 Rick, Thanks for the info on the AD chat...it is such a sad disease.....but as all of life, we have to take things one day at a time.This is a great place for support.(lately it is a little slow with replies, but maybe all are out with Spring fever!haha)Take care...post often


 rickl..Welcome to the forum...........and thanks for posting the info on the AD chat ....will try my best to get there ...........Hope you keep coming back as you will find alot of great peeps on here willing to share their experiences and they have good advice as well ...............As far as my Mom goes I did promise her yrs ago that I would not put here in a home and I will keep that promise ...........My Dad still lives with her so I check in a few times daily and do her care and any other things she may ned sone ....It had gotten hareder due to my crohns but I will get thru it with the support of my hubby daughter and friends here at HW ....you take care and GOD BLESS......LYN"
Update on my sister.,"Hello everyone. I went with my sister on Tuesday to the hospital. She was given that memory test(I dont know the proper term for it) The last one that she did 1 year ago she scored 13. This time she only scored 9 We were expecting her to score lower than last time because her symptoms are definatly getting worse. Yesterday while she was at my house she didnt make it to the toilet on time and I had to help her clean up and change her clothes. She realy caught me out because I thought that I was getting to know the signs of her needing to go to the bathroom. It seems that we are going to have to change the routine a bit and take her to the toilet every couple of hours just incase. As I thought he would, the Doctor has decided to stop prescribing Aricept. I just hope that she doesnt become more anxious or anything without it because the Doctor made it quite clear that they wouldnt put her back on it without ""real"" good reason.","Hmmmmm my dad is beyond using that test and he is still taking Namanda (sp?). Is this bad for him? He had been taking Aricept, but they switched hoping it would help. I don't really see that it has, but maybe he would be worse w/o it. Blessings!


 Bag Lady .......Hi there been awhile ......sorry you are going thru so much right now .......remember we are here for you ......God Bless ....Lyn


 NO hun I didnt did you send it yo Lynhowlyncat @aol.com.............I hope to hear from you ........God Bless and I hope all is well


 Drs normally discontinue medication when the MMSE is below 13...........


 My Mom is beyond that test as well and is still taking meds .......Snowy is this a good thing .........God Bless .....Lyn


 Lyn, I sent you an email. Did you get it?


 Ask the Dr about putting her on Razadyne.I've been on it 4 yrs,with no side effects.She needs to be on something or she will fade faster."
Dad has blood in his urine!,"Dad has A LOT of blood in his urine. I don't suppose this has anything to do with the alzheimers ??? Just wondered as I know we have a couple great nurses on this board. Mom took him to docs first day she knew about it and they did lots of blood work, etc. and scheduled him for ultrashound and a test (she didn't remember the name) using dye. The first appt. they could get for the test is two weeks away!! I told her to call back and have them schedule at another facility which can get him in SOONER. My brain is conjuring up things like cancer . . . he had prostate (roto rooter) proceedure done about 15 years ago and no sign of cancer then. Thanks for letting me vent. . . I'm not obsessing over this . . . but I would like them to move a little faster with their tests. Blessings!","Thanks Peter, Mom did take him to doc's first day she knew about it . . . they did say that it might be cancer . . . we are waiting for urologist appt. and tests. Thanks for your post. . . I'm glad this something that might have a fix. Blessings!


 Sometimes this could be a sign of kidney stones as well.......Is he complaining of pain as well ?Sorry I wasnt available AR but had a soft bowel test today.If he has no pain I would think it may be an infection.........If you cant get an appointment sooner you may want to take him to emergency room.Would you be able to get a urine sample from him ........you just need to really clean a small container (perhaps an old pill bottle) and I mean clean it really good and see if you can get a sample and take it with you to the hospital or Docs appointment.............. .Only my opinion but I know that I would want my Dad checked immediately.........Let us know how you make out please .....take care and God Bless.


 My father in law had this symptom, it was kidney cancer, which required surgery but he is doing fine now. You never know, I would get him checked soon. Peter


 Or,a Bad Kidney infection.


 Dad had his urologist appointment today. Doc said that they couldn't see anything on the urltrasound and that the bleeding may be from some irritation at the site of prostate surgery many years ago. They will be doing another test mid-May which is some type of cystascope with dy. Meanwhile, they are having him p in a cup and testing that each week. Thanks for your help."
Read what you medications are for,"Read & see what your medications are for,as many Drs.are using meds ""Off Label"",meaning not intended for the the use for diseases they are being used for.",SL.......this is all so true and the worst for alzheimers I feel is ativan.........I took tose back to my Moms doc and told him politely (well ok maybe not too politely) NEVER to rx them to her again..........she was so aggitated and very easily confused more than usual .............Great suggesstion and thanks .......take care and be well ......Lyn
Fear of Alzheimer's,Hi I am a 57 year old female and I am new here. My Father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and passed away in 1990. In 1996 my Mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and passed away in 1999. It is my understanding that my chances of getting the disease are greatly increased from the fact that both parents had it. Has anyone here been tested for the gene that carries the disease? Would anyone want to know that they were going to get the disease? My sibblings and I have debated that question for a long time. Thank you for listening.,"Hi SnowyLynn and thanks for the reply. Have you been tested for Alzheimers? You said after 8 years you are still doing okay. Are you taking medication or anything? I'd love to hear more about your situation.


 Thank you HealthProblem for your reply and for posting the article. I read it and it was helpful. I used to go to Alzheimer's support group meetings when my Mom was in the nursing home. I learned a lot from those, but I am aware that a lot has been learned in these five years since she passed away.


 hello there, my name is carrie and i've been taking care of my mother who has been sufferring from Alzheimers for about 4 years now. Following mild dementia, she now has no sense of personality. I am constantly by her side, looking after her, making sure that she is alrite. After much searching, i was able to come across this site, and i must say that it has helped me greatly. [www.alzinfo.org] i must say that i like the articles and postings in regard to the current studies on alzheimers and those underway. Hope it is of great help. take care, carrie L.


 Hi everyone. I'm sorry I haven't been back here for so long. I actually forgot I had a membership at this site till I was going thru my list of bookmarked sites and found you again. I hope everyone is doing well and I hope to return again soon.


 Thank you for your reply Rosie. I'm sorry about your Dad. It's really great that you are giving your Mom a break every week. I haven't found out anything.......I've tried not to deal with my fears. I have some physical health problems and depression too. I'm glad your sense of smell is still good. I hadn't heard that before. I have so many allergies and sinus trouble that I don't smell much. ha! Thanks again for replying to my post.


 Hi Lyn and thank you for your reply. I'll try to keep coming back. It's easier to stay in denial about things if I don't come here. lol I'm sorry for what you are going thru with your Mom. Seems we all have the worrying in common. Thanks again.


 I didn't know that an mri would show the plaques and tangles. I thought the only way to prove AD was an autopsy after death. I'm giving these replies a lot of thought!


 It's definite,AD can be found in Spinal fluid now........


 I'm in the second stage of the 7 stage chart,even after 8 yrs.I had the Spinal tap done,thogh the testing is done now that wasn't available then in the spinal fluid. Read the 36 hour day book.you can get it at your library,or if not ask then to order it,they will,even in large print...........


 AR......How ya doing sis and hows your Dad?...............Mom isnt doing too good lately relly still upset with the whole ""home"" thing and the other kids:it has me quite stressed as well...............But on a good note we went to Strathroy(howies mom lives there) and there is a 62 bed home for sale there and has 2 houses on property as well...........Went yesterday and met with the realtor and the place is beautiful (was a nursing home) comes fully equipped with all ya need to open and I still have contacts within the system for residents:I would open it as a retirement home and have some pysch patients as well(of course in different area though) and we could live in the big house and rent the smaller one out for income ............The Canadian gov has a great amount of monies availiable to start up businesses and will pay half of the employees wages for the first year.I am so excited about it all and I have that sparkle in my eye again ............I could take Mom and Dad with me there and the house is big enough for them to have their privacy and still be with me ..........This also solves the problem of the other kids sticking their noses in ...wish me luck will ya and lots of prayers sis ................Hope you are being well and taking care of self as well ...............God Bless......yak at ya soon ...........Lyn Ozzie........am constantly trying not to worry about me getting this DD but it is hard not too.....That book that SL recommended really is worth reading and I hope you are able to get ahold of it ..........Please take care and be well ....God Bless........Lyn


 Yes,Ozzie.Look in your library for other books written by those with AD.Larry Rose is one.You can look him up on the nest.....


 Am keeping you and your Dad (and Mom) in my thoughts and prayers sis ....give him a big hug for me .............It is my wish that Mom goes in her sleep as well w/o pain and suffering ,she too is slipping but not quickly ,and I pray that she just knows how much I love her and appreciate all she has done for me in my lifetime ............Take care and you be well too ..........Yes it will be a big undertaking but its something I love to do soooooo I am ready and maybe it will stop me from worrying about sickness all the time .............God Bless and Watch Over You and Your Family........Lyn


 Being prepared helps.Don't fear it,face it.I did.Still doing great after 8 yrs...........


 Hello Ozzie, Hang in there, you probably have alot of questions. I read an article that answer alot of questions for me: http://www.drlam.com/A3R_brief_in_doc_format/2001-No3-AgingBrain.cfm Enjoy the reading, I hope that it helps and answers some of your questions. Take Care- S


 I was tested twice,have 2 MRI that show the Plaque & tangles.i have only been dx 6 yrs,but knew 2 yrs.before.........


 I am a member of that site........


 Welcome back Ozzie!!! Glad to here you are still with us. Kindof quiet around here lately, nice to hear a new voice! I WOULD like to know if I am facing AD . . . my dad has it and he progressing again. He still lives at home with my mom and I try to get over there one or two days a week to give mom some time away (brothers and sisters help too) but it is sad to watch this disease progress. I'm sorry it took both of your parents. I did read an interesting article which showed that one of the first clues of Alzheimers is the inability to detect different smells like citrus and natural gas. I have an excellant sense of smell so that was especially good news for me, as I suffer brain fog from an autoimmune illness. Let us know what you have found out. Blessings!


 Ozzie............I havent met you before but am glad to see your post........ .as AR said its been very quiet around here lately............and always nice to meet new peeps and get some input as well as try and help others ............I am the caregiver for my Mom as well and I too worry that I may get this DD but I am trying not to let it get to me too much as I worry about everything lol............Hope to see you again real soon ...take care and God Bless.......Lyn


 Denial can come back & bite you in the butt!The sooner you face it,the better everything CAN be..............I'm living proof that denial shouldn't be in your life.I have had AD 8 yrs,still doing it MY WAY,LOL...........


 Ozzie, As far as I know, the MRI and other tests mostly rule out other things. You are right, there is not way to conclusively say Alz until autopsy . . . but they are getting much better at diagnoses each year. People with alzheimers can be best helped the earlier they find it and start treatment. The treatment tends to hold ground . . . not so much reverse the effects. I hope this helps.


 Wow! I hadn't heard that. Did you have the spinal fluid test? What stage of Alz are you in and what kinds of meds do you take? Thank you so much for sharing with me.


 Thanks Snowy! I have that book on hold at the library. I also found some Alzheimer activity books. I found that my dad is in stage 6 of the 7 stage chart.


 SnowyLynn, if the title of the book, The 36 hour Day?


 Lyn!!!! That sounds fantastic!!! But, wow, what an undertaking!!! That would solve a lot of probs wouldn't it! You wouldn't have two houses to keep either. (I guess you would have three . . . LOL). I see dad again tomorrow. He is slipping some more but I guess we knew it was coming . . . I just pray that God will smile on him and take him in his sleep one day before he loses his functions. I will enjoy every day I get to spend with him. Thanks for asking. Blessings!"
Abilify,"My primary mentioned using Ablilify,but not much has been said about it being used in dementia patients.Anyone know anything?I have cut my Seroquel 25mg in half taking it twice a week,it's still too much.Makes me feel not quite like a zombie,lol. While I'm still driving I refuse to take anything that will hamper my driving.","Don't want anymore strokes,I already had one back in Oct.from Vioxx.


 He's just a family practioner.That's why I have a Neurologist,lol. They are using many meds.as crossover meds.for different diseases.I know it's for Bi-polar & schitzo.But so is most of the Antipsychotics.


 Abilify.I ain't takin' it,lol.


 ...The Abilify is the med not recommended for dementia at all .It is used for bi polar and schiophenia from the info that I read PDS.............Take Care ....Hope to see you in chatroom on Sunday afternoon............GOD BLESS


 SnowyLynne...............The indications mentioned on the site for this med is for bipolar and schiophrenia(sp).The info cleary states not to be used in patients with dementia,may cause greater memory loss.........increased chance of strokes and mini strokes.I hope this helps you .You take care and God Bless


 ..I would ask your doc why he would want you on this .sounds pretty dangerous to me especailly for dementia and you would think he would know that .Take care and God Bless


 The Serroquel or Ablilify is the one that shouldn't be used?


 Ok, thank you.

Do concussions lead to Alzheimers?,"I have a good friend who has had some BAD luck falling on his head, literally. He has had so many concussions now from falling off of rooftops and two bad car accidents that his neuro doc thinks he is likely to develop Alzheimer's by his mid-30's. He's 28 now, so I'm worried for him. He can't drive at night and his doc wants him to stop driving altogether. He can't go to loud concerts or events that have flashing lights. His short term memory is deteriorating. To his credit, he does have a positive attitude about what is happening, but he is of the mind to resign himself to fate and go live on the beach in California. (Not that there's anything wrong with living on a beach! ;-) I'm wondering if anyone knows of cases with concussions leading to Alzheimer's and any good natural methods for stemming it? I have thought of recommending magnesium, fish oil, and good sources of saturated fat (grass-fed antibiotic-free hormone-free meat, extra virgin coconut oil) as I know that these are all good ""brain"" foods. I am also aware of relatively new research from Dr. Rashid Buttar, Dr. Boyd Haley, and others connecting mercury and other heavy metals directly to neuro-developmental (Autism etc.) and neuro-degenerative (Alzheimer's etc.) conditions. Dr. Buttar has been CURING Autistics using the chelator TD-DMPS. So knowing this makes me believe that unless my friend gets thimerosal-laced flu shots every year, it doesn't seem likely that he will develop Alzheimer's per se. It doesn't mean he won't still develop a neurodegenerative condition though b/c of the numerous traumatic events. Thanks, Patrick","Hi and welcome sorry your friend is going thru this but at least you are there with him right ,and thats a big help and shows him peeps do care .........I too believe that being traumitized to the head constantly will lead to Alzheimers ..........My Mom has it and was also beaten severly in her first marriage ......again welcome and tell your frien we are here for him if he wants to ask any Q's ..........we will try to support you in this as well ...take care and God Bless ....Lyn


 My Drs.think all the beatings I endured in the head from a former spouse was the cause of my being diagnosed with AD at age 56.No one in my family had AD as we know of.i'm 65 now,still doing great.AD meds.do work............"
Worried about LKE aka Lyn Kyle Emerick,Hello Chronie's . . . I'm from Lupus and Alzheimers and haven't seen my friend Lyn for quite a few days. Her last post was on 5/9 and it's not like her to be MIA like this. I sure hope she and her hubby are getting a few days away together . . . but I think I would have heard from her if she was planning to go away. Any news???,"AR and scardey cat..............You guys are the best I am truly sorry for all the worry I put you thru ....was MIA in my bed feeling sorry for self and broken ..........had a sore under my eye that had to be lanced and stiched and theres so much family crap going on I just buried self under blankets but I am back with a vengence.........Have missed you all so much and again I am sorry for all your worry .............Be back after the docs ok .............take care now my friends and God Bless.......Lyn


 My brother has been dealing with the realtor and things are going OK the government is slow but whats new lol......finger is great but the eye really scared me.........I am a sun worshipper but that is a big no no for me as well ....doc reinforced that today because of the methotrexate I have to take for the immune system. the eye sore was about the worst scare I have had with the sores and I wasnt mucking about with my eyesight thats for sure ....I have some pics but very gory I will be asking Peter before I put them on here this time ......really dont want to scare peeps......you take care and God Bless..........Lyn


 Hey Lyn, How are you feelin by now???? Just thinking about you sis!


 Nice to hear good news Lyn!!! Thanks for the update!


 Thanks SC! I do remember her talking about a property that they were looking to buy. I wonder if they are on a trip there. Also some here have had bad probs with computer virus. So I hope that is all that's happened. I know she is extremely involved with her mother's care (alzheimers) and spending time there daily. She is one tough cookie . . . but it's just not like her to be gone w/o notice. I am also praying for God's protection over her and her family. Blessings!


 Phewwww! So glad you are feeling better (are you feeling better?). Oh that eye must have been miserable . . . bet you wondered how much more the skin could stretch w/o ripping. I'm sure that was part of your flare. How is it feeling now? and how about that finger? BTW: I don't know if the sun affects you the way it does us Lupans . . . but for lupuans the sun is a no-no because it fires up the immune systems and can stir up the autoimmune activity as well. I'm just so relieved to hear from you!! How are the plans for buying that property? You are/have been in my prayers sis! Blessings!


 Oh Lyn, The sun can also activate your immune system (which can trigger autoimmune response in thos of us who have that going on). So, us Lupans have to stay out of the sun!! Sorry you had such a scare.


 Hey sis not doing too bad went to Howies Moms yesterday and had a great visit......made a big supper here and took it down there ........we all had a good time ......hope you are well .....give the family my huggs and luv for me .....be well ........God Bless and thinking of you too ......Lyn ........sis"
New Member,"Hi everyone! I have just recently been diagnosed with RA. I thought I had a deadly disease for a while. Has anyone ever had a problem with your hands going numb, especially at night? I also am going to start Methotrexate, as soon as I get up the courage to do it. I read about it and it has so many bad side effects that I am a little hesitant to take it. Have a lot of you been on it? How was it? My husband has been really good, but he feels that I am using RA to get out of doing things that I don't want to do. I find that with this sickness, noone thinks you are really sick because you don't look sick and sometimes you can do most everything. My mother-in-law told me she has arthritis too but she just doesn't let it get to her. I wish I could do that. Overall I think I am doing OK, but it does kind of suck, some days.","Dear Ms. Howe, I have to agree with Lyn. I was put on methotrexate last August. I started off on a low dose and it was gradually increased. I now take 7 tablets that are 2.5 mg per week. The only side effect I have is that it makes me very tired and sometimes I get sick to my stomach, but not always. I went off of it for 3 weeks only because I never seemed to get to the pharmacy for my refill. By the third week I could not even bend down to the second shelf of the fridge to get out a can of diet coke. So I went to the pharmacy that night. I had to go back to 4 tablets and have just now gotten back up to 7 tablets. It takes awhile to work so do not expect miracles over night. I would say that I did not notice a big difference until January. I have psoriatric arthritis along with several other conditions and it is a lot like RA. I hear you when you say about people who say they just get on with it. Oh how I wish I could do that. Some days are better than others. However I definately can not do what I did 3 years ago. However I can do more than I could do in September of this year, so things are looking up. Hang in there. My prayers are with you. judy/effie


 ..Ms Howe.......Welcome to Healing Well..........there is an arthritis forum where you are going to find alot of great peeps to help you out and answer any questions and concerns you may have ...........I take methotrexate for other disease and I find that the side effects are over rated ........at least for me ........Yes i get tired out from it and my vision does get blurry but I know that for me it has been a miracle drug and has lessened my problems alot .............There are so many that do not understnd Chronic illness and it is hard to live with it ........your hubby is welcome to check out the arthritis forum as well to get an idea of what others go thru on a daily basis ........I wish you all the best and you take care and God Bless .......Lyn


 Hello Ms. How and Welcome, I hope you've found the arthritus forum . . . but I'd be happy to comment as well. I just started taking meth. I've taken two doses now. I didn't get sick at all. It did make me feel sleepy. I have chronic fatigue, but this is differen't . . . but a nap here and there does the trick. Make sure to drink lots of water ther day before and the day of treatment and I take mine an hour before bed. I have the hands and feet falling asleep too. My rheumy said to wear wrist splints to bed. I have been doing that for months and the hands still fall asleep. Now, this week, they seem to be NOT falling asleep at night. I am still wearing my wrist splints to protect my wrists . . . but after another week or two w/o symptoms, I might try no splint. Hope you find lots of help in the arthritus forum! Welcome and Blessings!"
Is some improvement possable?,"Hello everyone, I wonder if you can help me figure somthing out. My sister is now 55 and she was diagnosed when she was 50 with what the Doctors called ""early dementia"" I have asked if it is Alzeimers that she has ,and the Doctor said that it was a ""Alzeimers type"" of Dementia. I still feel a bit confused about that to be honest,but anyway,to the main reason for my post. My sister lives with her Husband and Daughter. Six months ago my sister didnt seem to be able to think enough for herself to get up and get her self so much as a drink of water. Now suddenly over the last few weeks she has started making a cup of tea in the mornings for her self and her Daughter. She has also started to do some washing up and she had stopped doing that as well at one time. Can this possably mean that my sisters problems could be due to somthing other than Alzeimers? I personaly believe that a lot of my sisters problems have been made worse by her husband. He drinks alot. I am sorry to say but he is horrid. My sister blocked the toilet because she used kitchen paper instead of toilet tissue and instead of reasuring her and telling her not to worry instead he shouted at her and made her feel stupid. This has led to my sister now putting dirty toilet tissue in the bin(wherever she is)instead of her flushing it down the toilet. interesting I think that according to my sisters daughter,Husband is still in bed and not watching over her while she makes the morning cup of tea. My self and my other 2 sisters spend what time we can with her and make sure that she gets good meals and take her for days out etc,but there is only so much we can do when we have our own lives and problems to deal with. I have spoken with sociel workers about my sisters husband but they just say ""well we cant kick him out of his own house"" I just feel that without her husband my sister could be 50% better than she is. Do you think it is possable that her problems are more due to being trodden into the ground for so many years by her husband rather than it being Alzheimers that she has? Sorry to go on, but any thoughts on this would be apreciated. Sue","Thank Lyn. Yes my niece does still live at home with her Mom,although she is in her mid twenties and Engaged so she isn't going to be there too much longer. She is the one that makes sure my sister has her tablets at night and takes her shopping etc on the days that the rest of us can't help out. Too be honest my sisters husband will only go as far as the local shop to get his paper and booze so if the rest of us don't make sure that Stella(my sister)gets to her Doctors apointments etc,well I just don't know what would happen. But her Husband is the one that is claiming the care alowence. It is wrong,it should be going to my niece not him. He always seems to put on a show whenever a social worker goes around to see them and I am sure that they don't believe that he is as bad as we have told them he is. I will do what you suggested Lyn and ask if Stella can have more tests. I will let you know what happens. Thanks again Sue


 Sue ....it is a fact as far as I know that the hits on the head will or may contribute to this..........I am so sorry she or any woman or man for that matter has to live like this it really is so sad isnt it ...........glad you will look into it for her ......and in my opinion if he hits one whats one more right ....I pray thats not the case ....yes please keep me posted and you take care as wel ....God Bless ......Lyn


 Hello SnowyLynne Yes they do know because it is always myself and my neice that take her for Doctors apointments and we have also had apointments with sociel workers at their office and my sisters husband never comes. He always says he isnt well. He did go for one apointment though to do with sorting out care alowence(surprise surprise) Also my neice has been up to the office of the sociel workers in tears more than once on her own because the situation at home was becoming too hard for her to cope with. I personaly think that because the social workers know that there are some family that are trying their best,that to a certain extent they have the attitude of ""oh the family will make sure she doesn't die"" I am sorry I do know that these people do a lot of good but I am finding the whole situation very frustrating.


 I feel awful not knowing the answer to your question SnowyLynne,but Stella saw a Lady that I believe to be a Consultant and she was the one that sent Stella for the brain scan etc.and then I presumed that the results were then sent back to the consultant. I have to say that I do not know if a Neurologist Diagnosed Stella or not. I will definately question the Doctor about this at our next visit and I will also find out for sure what the ""consultant"" actuely specialises in. I know all about which Doctor to see etc and what questions to ask when there is anything to do with the digestive system because of my own health problems in the past,but when it comes to a Dementia type illness I am at a loss. I am learning though thanks to you and this board. I am going away for a week now because my family have organised a surprise holiday for me(one of my other sisters will make sure that Stella is ok while I am away) I will get back to you and let you know what happens at the next Doctors apointment. Thankyou both and take care Sue


 Sue ...........this sure sounds like it has that possibility BUT I would have the doc do some more tests and then you would know if it is from abuse or actually alzheimers ............was her hubby ever physically abusive to her causing her to hit her head alot ?I ther living in that environment is not good for her at all but what are you suppossed to do .......does her daughter live with her ? Snowy will prob be better at advice for you on this one but I would think she needs more tests and I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers ............God Bless ..........Lyn


 It's me again sorry. I forgot to mention somthing else and then I couldnt find the edit thingy lol. You asked if my sisters husband ever hit her. Well my niece says that he doesnt but I am realy not sure what to think because since my nephew has left home he is saying that his dad used to hit him when he was only young. I wouldn't be surprised at all to find out that he has hit my sister,but without proof it is like you said,what can I do? Sue


 Do the social workers know he doesn't take her to Dr.appoitments,& talk to the Dr?The Dr.can back this up.


 Did Neurologist Diagnose her?"

 No kick in the butt from me!!! Glad you retreated and took care of yourself. Sometimes we just need to be selfish.

Hospice Help Available to Alzheimer's Families,"Well . . . dad had some chest pain on Monday and we (mom and I) took him to the ER. They did all their testing and things are inconclusive as to his heart. But, while we were there, the doctor asked mom if she was interested in some help at home. We were unaware that hospice would help anyone until 6 months before probably death (sorry, I didn't know any other way to say that) . . . it turns out that we may qualify for some pre-hospice care which will include: Music and/or art therepy for dad, religious counseling (if requested), monthly visit by a nurse, 24 hour assistance by phone, doctors willing to make a house call, an aid to stay with dad if our family will all be unavailable, and many other things. I just thought that I would post here because I know that many of you are in the same boat. My dad is still able to feed himself (if we make the food). He is still able to walk on his own and he can get dressed with some assistance. He does need help with his person hygiene, but he can still use the toilet by himself. I hope you are all doing well . . . it would be nice to hear an update from each of you!! Blessings!", 
Mom Has Fractured Her Top Of Foot..............,"LKE,WHEW!Take a deep breath, girl!I read here often and post every now and then....I know a little of your situations, and also how often you help others with advice!Sounds like you're nearing overload, but we can't let it get us us down!I have a bipolar son,my boyfriend's mom has Dementia(so I know a lot of what you face with that.)

I've been so busy, I haven't had time to post much and haven't been over here to AD for a while. I don't know what to tell you about your family!! My mom is feeling pretty hurt too. She would even appreciate a phone call or a visit from everyone once in a while. Gets pretty lonely taking care of an AD patient . . . not to mention the loss of sanity!! I am trying to write a letter to my family to tell them where things are at. I don't know if it will help or just cause guilt. Guilt won't help anyone. If they can't help, they could AT LEAST send a card or call. I hear you sis!!! I know you are helping in spite of great medical probs of your own. It seems like most families are the same. One or two do everything. Sorry I don't have any great advice for you . . . but am sending you hugs, prayers and Blessings!


 Hey Lyn, I called two of my brothers yesterday evening. I talked to one and left a message for the other one. They are both very good, kind men . . . but they know that they have let too much time slip away. I told them that mom feels like a begger when she has to ask for help and that she needs them to come over even if it is just to visit. I also told them that I am having mom make a list of things she needs help with so they can check the list when the go over. We'll see what happens. I do have a sister who is eager to help . . . but dad will no longer accept her as a caregiver and he gives her terible problems when mom leaves. But, I think, he will take ok to the guys! He and I still have a lovely time. Today we painted a small crate to hold all the craft stuff I keep bringing over. He likes to paint . . . so I'll have to find more painting projects. Hope you are well sis . . . God is smiling at you for the time you spend with your mom. You are a real blessing to her!!! Let me know if things get better with your siblings. Blessings!

 Rosie, have u ever taken methotrexate b4? I started it last August for the Psoriatric Arthritis along with the genetic disorder they have found that I have. According to the way our health care system works in Ontario, I had to try methotrexate first and then add arava, before I would qualify to take ""Humira"" or ""Enbril"", not sure of spelling of the second one. When I started on the methotrexate I was given one tab for the first week then two then three then up to five, then i stopped at six tabs for a few months. next i was given arava and one more tab of methotrexate. I had to quit the arava due to side effects. When on the methotrexate I have to go for monthly liver enzyeme tests. A lot of people get sick from the methotrexate. kay gets really sick from it. I find for me, it just makes me very tired. I will sleep for a couple of days straight. Do you have any young children? What did the doctor give it to you for? Well..........that is it. I just hope you have better luck with it then me. I start humira on wednesday and am very nervous. judy


 Hey sis ........I am on methotrexate ,I take 6 every Monday and for me they totally make me exhausted and nauseous but the benefits much much outweigh the side effects at least for me ........They are used for my immune system as well and keeps those sores kinda at bay as long as I dont have alot of extra stress happening.......You will no doubt feel tired but as I said they do work if you can handle the tiredness.......dont know why your doc would think they would help with the problems of your not having energy lol.......at least everyone I know thats on them gets tired and some to sick to handle it as it is kinda like a oral chemo med.....I wish you the beat with it and I hope you can work with it as it does help....Take care sis ............God Bless ,,,,,,,Lyn


 .......Hey AR ......You said the doc would do periodic testing on liver functions?......Not good enough sis it has to be done once a month as the methotrexate is toxic to the liver..........I do not miss my blood tests ever since doc and I sat down and discussed all this and how important it was to get liver checked monlthly.......not trying to panick you but am concerned k lots of huggs and luv ..be well and God Bless...........Lyn


 Dear Lyn and Rosie, Thank you for your responces. I always love to hear from you guys. I am not sure if it is allowed, but I would like to start posting the most on diabetes, arthritis, depression and anxiety sites rather than fibromyalgia. Most of the problems I am having relate to these health issues right now. I get the understanding that as long as I do not paste the same post twice, that i would be allowed to post here. Do you know if I have to re register? Or do I just have to change my profile? I have also been trying to delete some of my old posts for a few reasons, including that I tend to be wordy. Further my niece is joining the ms forum so time for some editing about family members. LOL!!!!! I have enjoyed meeting so many of you at HW. I have made so many great people. This is a wonderful site. I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it. I can not tell you how much it means to me, when you two, take the time out of your busy days to respond to me. It is such a special happy feeling. Thank you for your words of encouragement and for being there for me. Please take care. Keeping you and your families in my prayers. May god Bless you and keep you safe in his ever loving care. judy

 Hey Effie, So sorry to hear about your hubby. I lost my first hubby at a young age too. Sounds like you did lots for your dad. That must have been rough being a single mom and all. I bet your dad was so appreciative! Thanks for sharing your great traditions with us. I think it is interesting to learn of different family traditions. Blessings!


 Hey Lyn, Awe. . . .thanks for caring about me sis!! Actuall, I was very tired yesterday (for some reason ) and I took two naps . . . then I went to bed at 6:30 pm!!!! I slept until 1:00 am and was up for about an hour and went back to bed and slept till 8:00 when my alarm went off. I think I could have slept another couple hours!! I had a doc appt today with the rheumy. He added some thyroid med to my buffet and also methotrexate. I told him that my biggest issue right now is fatigue. He really wants to help me with that. So, we shall see what happens. I take the meth once a week (6 tabs - 2.5 mg each) and the synthroid each morning 50 mcg. I sure hope this helps. I would love to get some energy back!! How have you been feeling???? Blessings!


 Hey Effie! No, I took my first dose of meth on Friday night. 6 tabs totalling 15 mg. I am to take it once a week (not sure how long). I have a lupus-like disease that is autoimmune in nature. Basically, my immune system doesn't recognize my healthy tissue as friendly. So the immune system attacks my skin and connective tissue. It is also attacking my thyroid. I don't have enough criteria for the doc to dx lupus and some of my symptoms could be another autoimmune dissorder. Doc says that it could still turn out to be lupus, scleroderma, or other autoimmune disorder or it could go into remission. I have been doctoring for this for about 3 years . . . although symptoms go back to teens. I am 52 now. He has dx me with UCTD and Hashimoto's. He has done the liver enzymes and will repeat them periodically. Thanks. I sure hope your humira works for you. Is that like Imurin??


 Dear Rosie, and Lyn, I too have found that the benefits of methotrexate outweigh the side effects. I have the same side effects as Lyn, extreme fatigue and nauseaus. However, I went off of them for 3 weeks. This was not a planned decision. I ran out of them. then my husband got sick and I was not well, so I just did not make going to the pharmacy to pick up my repeat a priority. I had been placed on the dosage, of seven tablets, slowly over time, then I went off them completlely, cold turkey, 7 per week to nothing. It was when I bent down, only as far as the second shelf of the fridge to get a pop, and experienced excrutiating pain, that I knew I had to make getting the methotrexate a priority. I went to the pharmacy later on that night. the pharmacist told me I could not just take 7 tabs again. he informed me that the methotrexate after not having taken any for 3 weeks would be out of my body. The pharmacist told me to call my rheumatologist. I was too afraid that the rheumatologist would get angry and deny me the right to start the Humira. I explained my fears to the pharmacist. The pharmacist said that if I would not go to the doc, to just start off on 4 tablets the first week. I did that. This week I took five. Eventually i will rebuild to the 7 tablets. Apparently once I have been on the humira for a while, I will have to wean off the methotrexate. You asked me if humira was like imurin. (not sure of spelling). I think they usually use this for hepatitis not sure. I have found some info for you and will see if I can paste it here. I know humira is a biologic type of drug. The TNF blockers Enbrel (etanercept), Remicade(infliximab) and Humira (adalimumab) have been a tremendous benefit in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. They are effective in over 70% of patients including many who have not responded to methotrexate - considered by many clinicians to be the gold standard of rheumatoid arthritis treatment. While methotrexate may take 8 weeks or more to achieve benefit, many patients see benefit from TNF blockers within two weeks. In addition, they are also very effective in relieving the fatigue that is a common symptom. Like all medications, TNF blockers have potential side effects such as an increased risk of infection including unusual infections such as tuberculosis (TB). There is some info for you Rosie. It is also used for psoriatic arthritis, which I have, even though I have no active psoriasis. It is also used for this genetic disorder I have. It has been successful for AS also and some other forms of auto immune disorders. It costs about fifteen hundred dollars every two weeks in Canada. It is very expensive. Thank god I have a good drug plan. Take care and hope methotrexate works for you. judy


 Hmmmm. . . Thanks Lyn, I have my nexst appointment in 6 weeks. I'll make sure we stay on top of the liver function. I think the synthroid is for the fatigue and the meth is for the connective tissue pain and plantar faciitis. Judy . . . thanks for the info. I love to know how this stuff works. I never had any nausea!!! Yeah!! Unless it builds in the system and causes the nausea. Thanks for your help ladies!! Blessings!


 Hi Effie, You can post in ANY forum. It is ok to duplicate a helpful message. The reason the admin doesn't allow copied posts is that people come in here to advertise their wares and HW should not have to pay for the space for them to advertise. If your post relates to two forums, it is ok to copy and paste. Now you'll have to edit the post above!!!! LOL cause your niece might see it!! I have thought really hard a few times about how I word things in case a family member every reads here. Glad you can enjoy more than one forum. Many of us do. You do not need to change your profile unless it is helpful to you. Blessings!


 Hey sis .........Its getting there lol........lots of fun ,and she thinks its funny ......ah well at least she is laughing.......hows your Dad and Mom doing hun?.....think about you all the time ........too bad you are so far away or we could have a cuppa .......take care sis and give them both a hug and tell Mom she is one special Lady and so are you .............love and huggs .........Lyn......God Bless


 Thanks Lyn, I will give you a call perhaps tomorrow and we can start planning our tea or coffee party. I know it's hard with all of the commitments you already have to your family. However if Howie and Cait are coming this way anyway, it would hopefully work out real well. We have so much in common and it is great to have found someone I can chat to, who also lives close. I will never forget and cherish the support you gave me, the first time I wrote a post. You were the first person who wrote to me and I just had streams of tears rolling sown my face. I have been working about 3 mornings a week. I was/am on full time disability, but I am just checking to see if I will be ready for work in September. Today I woked a full day and I am now completlely exhausted and suffering with pain in my lower back and exteme pain in the lower part of one leg. I guess I can still only do about 1/2 day. However it was so nice to be interacting with the children and other staff members again. One of the little girls I am helping wrote me a beautiful letter. I think I will have it framed. LOL Hopefully once I get the ""Humira"" I will be stronger. Take care, you and Rosie are always in my prayers. Wishing the best for you and Rosie and bothl of your families. Hope you are doing okay on the methotrexate. judy/effie"
Bath Time,"I recently read an article about bath time for the AD patient. There were a couple good hints in the article I would like to share . . . if you have any others, please post. If your loved one feels like someone is watching . . . cover reflective surfaces such as mirrors and chrome . . . the dimentia patient does not always recognize self in a reflection, but instead views the reflection as a stranger or just extra movement in the room. If you are giving tub baths, use a colored bath salt in the water (such as blue). Depth perception is often affected and the color helps the patient percieve the depth of the water, eliminating some of the fear. If you have a hard time giving a bath . . . try top half today and bottom half tomorrow. . . eliminating the need to totally expose the patient. Blessings!","Oh . .. bath bars are a good idea . . . duh . . . never thought of it. We'll look into that . . . good for Mom and Dad. Thanks. . . and the talking does help too. I haven't had to help dad with personal stuff yet . . . mom is doing well with that. but I do try to give her some tips. Blessings


 Hello, I am a newbie. Just moved the parents to my hometown to a retirement community. Mom is on the dementia adventure. The issue we have run into is washing her hair. We finally got her to take a shower, but is refusing the hair. She used to go once a week to a hair dresser and there is one available at the new community. Any tips out there?


 Oh . . . thanks Snowy!! I'll mention that to mom. She is installing a railing on the steps that lead into the garage too, so it would be a good idea to install the rail in show at the same time. Great idea, thanks! How have you been doing Snowy? Haven't seen you in while. Blessings!


 You go girl!! You really do stay busy, don't you. Nice to hear from you again! Blessings!


 ...Always Rosie..........These are some really good tips for bathing. I think that our Moms a Dads have a real hard time with the full exposure ,I know my mom gets embarressed and I do cove rmirrors and try to help limit her anxiety as much as possible .Not too long ago I had to shave her pubic area as she was going for a procedure that had to have area shaved.Now even though I was use to doing this with patients ,it was a different scenario for me and I know it bothered Mom .What I did in that instance was have her talk about all kinds of things and keep her mind off what was going on (and mine).We ended up laughing as I was trying to joke as well...........am sure that this helped her as well as me because you dont realise just what you may have to do for your loved ones.............................Another thing that I have found with mom is that her balance is off and she is afraid of falling so my hubby put bath bars in her tub for her to grasp and feel more secure...............It has become a special time now for me and Mom when we have ""bath"" time as we are able to talk openly during this time and this is special for me as well as her .............Thanks for the topic it is a good one and hope others have some ideas as well........Take Care and God Bless


 You can get them at home depot or a good pharmacy that has other supplies to help with the elderly and they are easy to install and cheap................Mom really does feel better being able to grab those bars and they are good to have them be able to lwer themselves into tub with help on the other side.If your Dad likes showeres they also have real cheap but sturdy chairs that will fit in tub so that he can sit if gets tired ...........be well and Huggs to your Dad............God Bless


 We put up grab bars long before we really needed then.We do need them now & are a godsend.Also got a showerchair with a back on it.Glad I have all the little helpers.


 I been here & there,& everywhere.I'm on many AD boards.Also am on a disability chat on MSN.I keep my mind very busy,can't afford not to.


 As for bath time,If it's cold I don't take my clothes off period.I sleep in what I have on when it's cold.I do bathe several times a week,gotta keep the stench down,lol."
Need help from those who know,"I'm sure you will have given this information often before so please forgive me for asking for your help. I have read the forum and altho' there is a great deal of useful information, I still need to ask the following questions. My parents are aged 82 (mother) and 80 (father). They are just about to go into hostel care (supported living) together. My Dad is chronically disabled with numerous health problems and my Mum is no longer able to care for him physically. Mum is fiercely independent and will allow no help from me or my 3 siblings, unless she asks for it. Sounds OK, but in real life it has just meant she is over-taxed and cannot cope. However, my questions concern onset symptoms of Alzheimer's. My Mum is the person I have concerns about . Can you tell me if the following signs / symptoms are consistent with the onset of Alzheimer's, please? forgets words and phrases (much more so in the last few weeks) eats very little and expects everyone else to eat very little too - can't understand why others want more food cooked one chicken breast to feed 3 people and thought we were being unreasonable when we asked for salad and bread and butter (this is the same woman about whom we used to joke that she was always ready to feed the 5000!) cannot remember some things at all, and remembers other things (usually from long ago) very well. repeats herself continually - this used to happen from visit to visit - she'd forget what she told you last visit - but now happens within the same visit. tries to ""cover up"" memory slips or forgetfulness couldn't find an address when she was driving, despite it being a straightforward street address and having been to the house just the week before constantly forgets her PIN number and has the Bank asking us to ""do something about your mother"" sometimes leaves taps running (altho' hasn't left the stove on yet as far as we know) when she feels overwhelmed, says ""I can't deal with that now"" and refuses to consider things - even urgent matters. So far we've been able to cajole her into letting us take necessary action, but this is getting harder to do has always been very strong intellectually but now has difficulty with simple addition - forgets to ""carry"" has always loved playing Scrabble but now sometimes puts down a word that does not exist and / or misspells a word. This might sound paltry, but is unheard of in my mother previously!! is overwhelmed with anger about simple things not going right - for instance: refuses to use the microwave to cook porridge because ""it makes the porridge too salty"". Also, very upset because her favourite brand of underpants has been discontinued - very cranky about this and could not be consoled highly suspicious of people's intentions (this is excacerbated - she has ALWAYS been very suspicious of people). For instance: very angry that the Hostel requires her and Dad to have 10 changes of underwear, for example. ""Why do we need 10 changes of underwear? We've never owned 10 pairs of underwear in our lives. They must be going to steal them."" Seems to understand when we explain about laundry times, but goes back to same complaint almost immediately. Do these things sound like early symptoms of the disease? We feel they probably are, but she will not see a doctor for a check up, so it is hard to get any confirmation. As the carer in their relationship, she has always dealt with the business matters and has been highly competent (ran her own business for years). Now she forgets to ask for vital information or, if told, forgets it immediately. Examples: times of appointments; locations of places she needs to be. If she is asked about these things she'll ""cover up"" and say ""oh, that is at ........... place"" or ""at ....... time"". Needless to say, we then have to check up and, on finding she is mistaken, try to tactfully tell her what the true situation is. Naturally she then gets upset and says things like ""I'm just stupid"". We say things like ""Oh well, you,ve got a lot on your mind at present - it's not surprising somethings slip"". Should we try to ""excuse"" her behaviour - ie. collude with her efforts to convince us there is nothing wong? Sometimes she will say to me ""I think I'm getting Alzheimer's"" - I respond by asking her to tell me more, but she always clams up then and changes the subject. Should I tell her I think she might be right? Dad is a dear but his health problemns and his long term reliance on Mum mean he is no use in this situation. I asked him if he thought she was getting ""more forgetful"" and he said he would probably agree with that. I'm very fortunate to have 2 sisters who are very good and a brother who doesn't do much but is caring. The family are very supportive of my parents and spend a lot of time with them. We feel lucky that they have found a place together in a Hostel, but we also feel guilty that none of us are taking care of them. I guess I just need to have my concerns either validated or refuted. Any advice anyone can give me about how to go forward would be very gratefully received. My parents both think I'm ""bossy"" but I know that it is often only due to my intervention that important things get done at all. I hate them to be in the position where they are partly grateful for my help and partly resentful of my ""interference"", but I can't see any way around this. I'd better stop before you all have eyestrain! Please help me!","Hi Kezia, Welcome to the forum!! SnowyLynne is right, she needs to be evaluated by a neurologist. If you know who her physician is, try giving them a call and let them know your concern so the doctor can bring it up, give her a referal and follow-up. I am no expert but it sure sounds like some kind of dimensia . . . but the cause is the big issue. The neuro needs to rule out a couple other things to begin thinking about an Alzheimer's diagnoses. For my dad they did several tests. . . like cat scans or mri's of the brain and things like that to see if there had been a previous stroke or blockage. The docs are pretty good at getting the patient to comply with a referral because the elderly respect the docs and they usually don't question his intentions. Keep us posted!! Blessings!


 Welcome Marbil . . . thank you for your very uplifting post. My dad REALLY responds to physical affection too. Glad you found us!! Blessings!


 The only way is to get her to a Neurologist for testing,but it sounds like it. Whatever,it needs to be done ASAP!


 Keiza, Many of the symptoms you outlined are the same as my mother's and she has been diagnosed with Alzheimers. My father had the same symptoms. He had severe Demensia and eventuall died from complications several years ago. It is very hard to deal with, but we once heard some great advice from Ronald Reagan's children. They never stopped showing their love towards him. They always hugged him whenever they came and left the nursing home. He had little memory of who they were by name etc. but he always knew who they were by the loved they showed Him clear up until he died. That was inspiring to us so we tried this with my mother and it does work. No matter how frustrated or disgusted we get with her behavior, we always let her know she is loved, we hug and kiss her, and make sure she is included in all of our family get togethers. We have to remember that she is not at fault for the way she acts and that even though she is partially debilitated, God still has a plan to use her, and we actually see that happen quite often in the way she returns love to others. We also pray for her daily and ask our friends and loved ones to do the same. She is on all of our prayer chains as well. There is no such thing as a hopeless situation with our God. He is in control and will do what is best for the victim and their families. we just have to believe that and allow Him to do His will. We are praying for your mum, and your family, and ask God to pour His blessings on all of you. Love and Peace Marbil"
MOM passed away,"Hi, everyone: It has been a while since I was on this site. It was great to be able to have the help and advice of others that had a loved one with alzheimer's. My mom passed away, at my home, 4 months ago. Alzheimers Disease won the battle. Mom was in the late stages, when I was on this board last. She continued to get worse, forgot how to eat and swallow, and drink. Her weight was down to 70 pounds at the end. Her heart finally gave out, and she passed early in the morning. I was in the kitchen making tea, and wasn't present at the moment, came back and found her gone. I am still not over this. I feel so sad. I loved her very much, and if anything, I am happy that she was able to live at home instead of a nursing home. She lived to be 96 years old, and had Alzheimers for 15 years. Just wanted to share this with all of you. Sincerely, Forget-me-not. P.S. Please say a prayer for MOM in heaven. Thanks.","Forget Me Not ............I am so sorry for your loss ,it is not an easy thing to live with ......you should be so proud of yourself for giving your Mom her last years with you at home and not in an institution ..........I am a retired RN and had a retirement home yet I would not put my Mom in one and still look after her .........I would not trade it for the world and I am sure you have a whole lot of great memories of her ........When and if you want to share them we will be here .............I always praise those that have the courage (yes it takes courage ),and the love and committment to their Mom or Dad to look after them as they looked after us and didnt put us in homes .......dont get me wrong for some they have no option but I really am one for keeping our loved ones at home with us ...........cry for and with your Mom if you feel you need to and remember that you gave her those last wonderful years with you ............she has a ""special daughter "" and a strong one and as you cry remember hun that she is in a gentler place with no pain looking down on you with pride .........Take care and God Bless ......Lyn


 Hope you are doing ok ....thinking about you ..........God Bless.......Lyn


 Hi, everyone: Thank you so much for your kind words and thoughts. I was deeply touched by the replies that I received. The flower that represents the Alzheimer's Society here in Ontario, Canada is the ""forget-me-not"". I used to say to my Mom to ""please forget me not"", but the disease wouldn't let her remember me for the last 10 or so years. It was hard when she would not know who I was. I got a job 2 weeks ago working for the Canadian Red Cross, as a Community Support Worker. I had a lot of elderly clients, and palliative clients. I only lasted one week, and had to resign, as I was so sad at the end of the day. It made me miss my Mom even more, and sitting with clients that were terminal was heart-breaking for me. I can't seem to get my life back on track, yet, but I will keep at it. Thanks again to all of you that replied. Sincerely, Forget-me-not. ""Make your day count""


 Dear Forget-me-not, I lost my mom too, to Cancer. How wonderful that you could care for her. I did too but I only cared for mine a short time, about 6 weeks. We were very close, my best friend. It takes time, for me it has been 2 yrs. It takes as long as it takes, I guess for me I had to learn how to live my life without her. Because she was a part of it every day. It has been the hardest thing I have ever done. It is strange even after 2 yrs I caught my self picking up the phone to tak to her. Dont rush no matter what anyone says, believe it or not we do find our own pace. I had to relearn how to live without her in my life. Now I have come here because my aunt, my moms sister has Alheimers. The doctors say since my moms death and her grief it has really sped up the process. My uncle takes care of her 24/7 and will not allow anyone else to help they have been married for over 50 yrs. He is getting so tired. After my mom I hoped that we could have a little time to heal. I hope perhaps that I could get some sugestions on how to help my uncle he really needs a time out. Thanks Belkar


 Hi Your mail did really catch my attention. It reminded me of my uncle who passed away in similar circumstances. Only you can understand the pain you are going through. I pray for your mothers well being.


 It is a hard disease. I am thinking of you. dammy


 Sorry for your loss.............


 Dear Forget-me-not, I just planted some of those flowers in my garden last week. Now I will think of you and your mother every time I water them. I am so pleased that you were able to care for mom at home for SO long!! God bless you dear! Of course you are not over it yet. But I hope you don't have any guilt eiter. We do what we can do and we can't do everything . . . so be kind to yourself sis!! I love to think of your mom in heaven with a brand new (perfect) body that works well!!! I wish you could see how happy she is. You did good sis!!!! Blessings!


 Well . . .I went out and watered my Forget-me-nots this evening . . . and I thought about you and your mom!! You sound like you will do well. You just haven't found a good groov yet. When you care for someone around the clock like you did for your mom, it is a very difficult loss. It is like losing a child. Your entire life for the last 10 or 15 years has revolved around your mother's care. That leaves a great big empty space in your life now. To top it off . . . friends probably are relieved for you and think that your life should be better now that your don't have the responsibility of your mom's care . . . so that just adds to the hurt. I hope that just the right thing comes along for you sis. I'll be thinking of you. Blessings!


 Hi, Chevy. Thanks for your reply. I was sorry to hear about your MOM passing away with cancer. Also, sad to hear that your Aunt has Alzheimer's. It really does seem to speed up, when there is a traumatic experience that they go through. My MOM's Alzheimer's got worse when my DAD passed away suddenly of a heart attack. My sister and my mother found him outside on the ground with an axe in his hand, as he was chopping wood, (we lived in the country on a farm). He had a massive heart attack and passed away, while chopping the wood. Then about 3 years ago, MOM fell in my driveway, and broke her hip, and that trauma to her body, really sent her deeper into Alzheimer's. Then lastly, her brother died of a heart attack, he was 91 and she was 96, and she used to call him her ""little brother"", it was so cute, when in a moment of wisdom, she recognized him, and referred to him that way. His death was 3 months before hers, as the Alzheimer's hit the last stage, and she went down hill very quickly, forgetting how to eat, and speak, etc. There is a lot of help out there for family's with a loved one that has Alzheimer's. In Canada, where I live, the Canadian Red Cross offers homemaker service, the Alzheimer's Society checks up on the caregiver, and helps any way they can, although, the Alzheimer Society kept wanting my sister and I to put MOM in a nursing home, and said at one point, they could do it whether we agreed or not, if they wanted to. That really bothered me. Also, there is Respite, we had a lovely lady come in a play songs (the old fashioned ones) to Mom, and sing, and show her pictures in a beautiful big book, etc. These services are usually free, too. Hope this helps. Will keep you in my prayers, sincerely, Forget-me-not.


 Dear Forget-me-not, I am so deeply sorry for your loss of your mother and father. I too live in Canada, and have lost both of my parents. My mom died shortly after my 18th birthday after struggling for two years, perhaps longer, and she just never told usthat she was ill. My dad died suddenly, from heart, in 1999. I often wonder which loss was harder. I knew mom would eventually die, but dad was a shocker. I miss them both. I have no regrets. I did everything I could to be a good daughter. They were such wonderful people and I loved them so. Time makes things easier, but I am not sure we ever totallly heal. I went to see a psychologist who specializes in grief. I went to see him after I lost my first husband tragically to an accident at work. He advised me to tell my story and tell it again and again. He said one day I would no longer need to tell it quite so often, and then I would start to heal. It is in the remembering that we learn to move on and recognize that they are in peace now. I have often struggled with the ""what ifs"", but I know these are unanswerable questions. Dear God, Please lift forget me not, a daughter who dearly misses her parents into your loving care. We know that her parents are in a far better place, but it does not make it any easier on those of us that are left behind. Every little thing will remind us of them. Help forget me not to find better days ahead. Days that are filled with joyous memories and less sadness. Wrap your arms around her and give her your tender loving care and understanding. Grant her parents eternal life with you our dear Lord. Help Forget me not to find her place in the world again. It is so easy to get lost, do not let her get lost. Please guide this wonderful daughter. Help her to grieve her loss and to also find an increasing amount of joy in each day. Remind her that she will never forget them. They will always be silent angels walking on her side. I ask this in Jesus' name Lord hear our prayer, Amen. Judy/Effie"
My Significant Other's frightening behavior (?),"It's really late at night, but I need some advice. This is my second post -- my first was on ""New Here"" by SnowyLynne. I'm 62 years old and my Significant Other of almost a year is 74. We get along really great, and he is very flexible!! He's a widower of 8 years, after a happy marriage of 31 years. To a strong woman who didn't do everything to please him! Which is great, because I'm a strong woman, too, so we get along great. Neither of us is the ""dominant one,"" and we communicate very well. We are both strong willed, emotional, artistic, creative, and can be stubborn. We are also very loving, kind to each other, and affectionate. We are very sweet to each other, and help each other out in every way. We take care of each other -- are real family, and know and love each other's extended families, too. If we get angry, we have learned to get over it quickly. We create for ourselves a program to follow, with a prayer, so we can remember what we need to ""practice"" to help us keep on the ""right track"" in our relationship. We are doing a good job and we both feel very good about things! He dated during his 8 year widowerhood, but I am the only serious relationship he has had. He's careful and knows who and what he wants. I feel the same. He's wonderful. The only reason we are not married, is that I refuse. I have been married and divorced 3x, and will never every marry again. I am happy with my situation as an S.O. to a loving man, and he is happy,too. I think he'd probably be happy to marry me, but whether he would or not is a moot point. We have exchanged Commitment Rings. We are both in our relationship for life and know it. Tonight, he took me to the theatre, which he does a lot. He's the senior actor there, although he has not been acting for over a year due to eye problems. (He'll be getting back into acting soon, since he's been cleared now, by his ophthalmologist, though.) I'm planning to get more active in the particular community theatre we both love, and even appeared in a music duo there with him last Christmas. Tonight, after the theatre date, he was talking about where he wants to go together next week. He gave the address and said it was on the ""East Side,"" and I said I thought it was on the West Side, but he might want to look it up. He adamantly said he knew it was on the East Side. I said I didn't think so, described the intersection at that particular East Side corner, and said why not go ahead and look it up? Nothing lost by doing that. Well, he happened to have a paper with the place's address. He looked up the address. Then, in front of a couple of other people -- one of whom we both knew slightly -- he pronounced, ""Yes, it **is** on the West Side -- just like I said."" In other words, he took the words from me! Switched positions! This just absolutely floored me. He and I are both highly forgetful. We both just hate being this way. I think I hate being the way I am, more than he hates being forgetful. In other words, forgetfulness bothers me as a concept/condition more than it does him. He is less of a philosophical sort than I am. He'll get really angry and burned up about a **situation** like losing his keys, whereas if I lost my own keys, I'll see it as a symptom of aging and creeping forgetfulness. So anyway, this was the first -- but I think probably not the last -- time this behavior on my Dear's part. So I am wondering whether anyone here might offer any suggetions for me? 1. Should I just never talk to him about directions at all? Travel with a capital T has caused us problems in the past. We have been able to solve the problems so far, though, by reasoning that if we can't agree on a travel direction or mode of transportation [to our destination, that is], we'll just get to our mutual destination under our own steam and our own way. (We both take public transit, so that's easy.) 2. When my Dad had A.D. Mother said she learned in her A.D. support group ""Never Argue."" Daddy was a retired lawyer. How on earth Mother learned ""never Argue"" with such a man, I will never know. But she did. And she was his caregiver for 5 years. Daddy argued about everything. For his whole life. As his daughter, guess what? I learned to argue! If challenged to argue, I respond with a counter argument. ""I grew up on the witness stand,"" since Daddy was a lawyer, and later a judge. S.O. also argues. Remember what he said: ""Just like I said, it's on the West Side""? Prior to that, it was just a simple discussion. He turned it into a battleground y that simple remark! To me, that was throwing down the gauntlet. How? By (1) stealing my position; (2) saying it was his position in the first place; (3) saying ""I win, so you lose"" in front of other people -- while using my knowledge to win with! 3. Lastly, would a language behavior like the one S.O. used this evening mean possible dementia? And if so, what now? This is a long post -- I sure hope somebody can give me SOME info. Thanks, ElderBerry","Good question. He's resistant to initial suggestions, but a reasonable person. I did some reading up on the tests required to identify the possiblity of A.D. or other dementias and they are legion!! Gee. I want to know if I have A.D. but it's almost not worth it to go through all that. Gosh. What a choice. Also, SL, you mention that your X-ray or something could discern the tangles....the info I read didn't say anything at all about that. Is this something very new? If what you say is true, then definite, positive dx is possible. And what I knew from when Daddy had A.D., plus what I read last night, say no definitive dx is possible. EB


 No exray,MRI. I had 2 they BOTH showed Plaques,Tangles & Atrophy......


 Will he see a Neurologist????


 Oh, and anyway, by the way -- I'm still wanting to know what **I** should do if and when he acts that way again -- i.e. changing his ""mind"" -- i.e. switching into something extremely illogical like last night. Also any tips on how ""not to argue."" Tanks so much for ANY thing anyone has to offer. Elderberry PS is it okay to capitalize a word or two for emphasis? That is my style, and isn't shouting. It's for emphasis and I hate typing ** before and after. I think that it tacky. Is it possible to do italics? I could do that."
Lyn needs our prayers,"Dear HW friends, I just called Lyn and she was on her way back to the hospital. Let's start a prayer. If we all pray hard, I trust the Lord will restore her health soon. She works so hard and is so very sweet and truly dedicated to everyone here at HW. For those of you who do not pray, just send positive thoughts and words of encouragement. The positive vibes will go her way I am sure. Dear God, Please take Lyn into your arms and make her well. She is so dear to all of us and it breaks our hearts to hear that she is suffering. Be with her and help her to remain strong and to fight this latest battle. I trust that with your help she can do it. Please God also be with her husband and her daughter and son. Give them the strength to get through all of this worry. Especially remember her son who is going through his own difficulty. Help his world to mend and get better so Lyn will not worry about him. Be with Lyn's mom and dad and help them through this time too, so Lyn will not have to worry about them either. Be with Cait as she worries about her mom, and with Howie as he worries about his wife. Grant them all courage and faith in your powers to heal all. Dear God, be with all the doctors and nurses and grant them your never ending wisdom so that they may give Lyn the best possible treatment. And help all of us to remember to pray for Lyn and her family and send our love to her. May she feel the warmth of all of her HW friends embrace her during this difficult time. We ask this in Jesus' name. lord hear our prayer. Amen, judy","Lyn,Prayers winging thier way to you.

 Lyn, Welcome Home!!!!! I am really glad to hear that you are home. I prayed for you daily. I had no idea you were going through so much. I did not know you had PG, nor did I know what it was. Now that I have done some research on it, I just feel so bad for you. It is an incredibly painful condition. Yet, I do not recall one time that I have heard you complain about it. Please, please take care and do not do to much. If there is any way I can help out, just email me and I will be there in a couple of hours. Also if we find a doctor in Toronto that has a better treatment method, you are welcome to stay here with us. I did some research for Martin and it turns out there is a new cure for his plaque psorasis. He will need twelve injections of this new drug, once every two weeks, or once a week, and then he is likely to go into remission for up to two years. His psorasis is now very bad anc covers more than 80% of his body. The doctors in Brampton were only willing to try methotrexate. We are hoping he will get into see this Toronto doc this summer so he will be ready for the next school year. Anyway, back to you, I will keep praying and would love to talk to you when you feel up to it. I pray that the treatment that they started at the hospital will continue to work and start to work a lot better now that you are in your own bed, and not around nasty people. Congratulations about Cait. How are things going with your son? How is your mom? Welcome home and God Bless. love ya, Judy


 Lyn, How you doing sis?? How is mom? and your family? I know you've been busy with the move, I hope it didn't zap you again. Keep us posted sis. Effie . . .how have you been feeling lately?? Seems odd to ask here, but I knew you first at the AD forum and I've been wondering if you are ok. Blessings!

 Howie, I forgot to mention that I am praying for Lyn's speedy recovery. I just do not want to see her come home too soon and then over do it. Lyn is such a beautiful person and all I want is for her to get truly and fully better. I also pray that she will not worry. Rick, Cait and you remain in my prayers as well as Lyn's mom. Lyn, you are in my prayers. Please try not to worry. I hope the hospital staff, doctors and nurses are treating you with the best possible care and you are getting stronger to fight off this illness. I pray that they will find a way to put this nasty condition into a permanent remission. You have given to so many and are so loved by us all. We miss you, but the number one priority is for you to get well. sincerely, judy


 OH NO!! I haven't checked here in a few days and your falling apart Lynn!! I'm so sorry you are ill again. Sending you a big hug and lots of prayers sis!! Emmie . . . thank you for starting this prayer string. Father God, I come to you saddened by the difficulties that Lynn and her family are dealing with. Father this poor woman takes on just too much. I bet that you have allowed her to be brought her to her sick bed just so she will take care of herself and rest. I pray that this pause in her devoted service to her mother and family will cause her siblings to pick up their pace and help with things as they are soarly needed by their mother. Father, we trust you with our dear sister and we know that you loved her first and that you have counted every hair on her head. Please allow your peace to rest on this family. In Jesus name, Amen!


 ...Always Rosie,thanks for being there and we know how busy you are and that you are not well either , I will pass on your messages to her,,,,could you update in the mod forum for me that she is not out yet so that Peter knows please.be well and thanks again ,Howie and Cait

Thanks again Judy and Howie for your reports!! Lyn, I'm sorry your move will come on top of your recovery . . . but wow, Howie and Cait really took care of things!! Let them do the lifting and moving for you. You can stay in the downstairs apartment and put things away where you like. That WILL be a blessing to be on the first floor. You poor baby. Now you need to carve out rest time for YOU every day. I am careful about tht and I will commit to doing many things, put I put a provision in that I need a space of time to rest between activities. Dad and I have taken to napping now . . .LOL !! God is so good. On just the days I need more sleep, dad suggests a nap!! Thank you God!! and Thank you God for making our friend, Lyn, take a rest!! Glad you are home Lyn!!! Hi Judy!! Blessings!


 Lyn, I just saw this tread. I'm sorry you have been in the hospital so long. I hope you are doing a bit better. I just want you to know you are in my thoughts and prayers. Love you, Babs"
Alzeheimers disease with related prurigo nodularis,"Hello, I am really new to to this site. I am interested in a discussion on Alzheimers disease with related prurigo nodularis. I work in a community where we provide care for Alzheimers patients. Over the past several months several of the residents have developed a ""rash"". When these residents are sent out to their PMD's they return with a diagnosis of: dermatitis, eczema, papular rash, etc.... This ""rash"" seems to be spreading and we have had several cultured fro scabbies with a negative diagnosis. A number of steroid creams have been prescribed by their physicians, none of which have really solvd the problem. Several of the caregiving team have also been affected with this same ""rash"" and are positive that it is scabbies even though there has not been one diagnosis of such, and are extremely upset that the medical community in which we live offers little to no help. The state and public health dept have also been envolved and can offer no help. This evening my boss went to her dermatologist and was diagnosed with prurigo nodualris. Does anyone know if this is a related problem with the mental debilitation of the Alzeheimer's disease? I know that it is affects the peripheral nerves as with shingles, and is a histamine over production. Does anyone know anything about any relation? Can anyone HELP???? Post Edited By Moderator (Admin) : 5/19/2005 8:17:11 PM (GMT-6)","Hi and Welcome to the HW forum ..........I too have not heard of this before and I was a geriatric nurse for many years........as AR posted there are sites for dermy Q's and you can do a google search to see if you can find out anything ........sorry couldnt be more help,and I hope you get some answers .....I too will check a few sites I go to for my skin problems and see what it says............meanwhile keep us posted and let us know if you have any luck at all .....Take Care and God BLess......Lyn


 Hi, I hope that you are still checking in about this condition-my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease about three years ago and was taking medication for it (exelon and namenda) until recently-about a year ago she started getting this ""rash"". At first she was treated for scabies and then later for allergic reaction-it became such a problem that her physician recommended that she be taken off of ALL her medications-the skin condition has improved, but her memory and overall well being has not. Please, if anyone knows any treatment, let me know--Also, her identical sister has Alzeheimer's Disease and takes the same medications and has not had this reaction (they do not live near one another).


 I did some lit search: In 1880, Hardaway first described a kind of chronic, hard and globular skin nodules which were characterised clinically by an intense itch . The disease was named prurigo nodularis by Hyde in 1909 . Lately, many studies were performed to detect its causes and mechanisms. Some factors, such as emotional stress, seem to be contributory in certain cases. Around 80% of the patients have an atopic constitution and it has been claimed that in 20% the condition starts after an insect bite . Histologically, the disease is characterized by irregular acanthosis, hyperkeratosis and an inflammatory cell infiltration. The neurohistological changes includes a massive neural hyperplasia , which has been further verified by neuronal peptide staining as well as protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFr) staining [5, 6, 7]. Recently, mast cells, neutrophils and eosinophils were investigated in order to enlighten the mechanism of the disease [8]. But, the etiology is still not clear. Treatment of prurigo nodularisnext term with topical capsaicin Sonja Ständer MDb, Thomas Luger MDa and Dieter Metze MDb From the Department of Dermatology,a and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cell Biology and Immunobiology of the Skin,b University of Muenster. Available online 15 May 2002. Abstract: Background: Prurigo nodularis is an eruption of lichenified or excoriated nodules caused by intractable pruritus that is difficult to treat. Therefore the antipruritic efficacy of capsaicin seemed to be of particular interest because this alkaloid, extractable from red pepper, interferes with the perception of pruritus and pain by depletion of neuropeptides in small sensory cutaneous nerves. Objective: The aim of this concentration- and regimen-ranging study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and practicability of capsaicin in the topical treatment of prurigo nodularis in a large series of patients. Methods: A total of 33 patients with prurigo nodularis of various origins were selected to receive capsaicin (0.025% to 0.3%) 4 to 6 times daily for 2 weeks up to 10 months. The consecutive follow-up period was up to 6 months. In 7 patients, skin biopsy specimens were taken before, during, and after therapy and investigated histologically, immunohistochemically, and ultrastructurally. Results: All 33 patients could be evaluated for efficacy. After cessation of the symptoms of neurogenic inflammation, such as burning sensations or erythema, all of them experienced a complete elimination of pruritus within 12 days. In addition, capsaicin largely contributed to the gradual healing of the skin lesions. After discontinuation of the therapy, pruritus returned in 16 of 33 patients within 2 months. At the ultrastructural level, no degenerative changes of cutaneous nerves could be found during or after capsaicin therapy. Depletion of substance P was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy thus confirming the specific effect of capsaicin in vivo. Conclusion: Topical treatment of prurigo nodularis with capsaicin proved to be an effective and safe regimen resulting in clearing of the skin lesions. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2001;44:471-8.) The connection of this disease with Alzheimers may be due to the meds taken to treat Alzheimers. cholinesterase inhibitors (Razadyne, Exelon, Aricept, Cognex): prevent breakdown of acetylcholine Namenda: N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, regulating glutamate Both groups increase neurotransmitters to counter neurodegredation and might be responsible for the neural hyperplasia as stated in the above article, resulting in prurigo nodularis. Not a doctor, but I hope this helps some. Ben


 Ben Hi and welcome to HW ...........thank you for your input and the resaearch . My Mom doesnt have this as yet ,but is steadily going downhill . Hope to see you post often and you will find great peeps on here for support.....God Bless......Lyn

 I have never heard of the condition . . .but I'm not health care professional either. I have a derm site that I go to for things. . . I'll check it out and if it has any info, I'll share the link.


 Well . . . I was unsuccessful in finding the picture . . . but there may be more information at this site. http://www.dermis.net I have found a wealth of info there. You might find more if some time were put into it. Sorry, I thought I might quickly find it. Sorry I couldn't help.


 Hello Sounder and welcome to the Alzheimer's forum at Healing Well. I'm sorry I don't know anything about that reaction to nemanda. My dad does take that same drug, but he is steadily declining mentally. So sad. But we really try to enjoy each day with him. One thing I can think of is that many meds can cause many people to be sensative to the sun. Does your mom spend much time outside. If she is sun sensative because of the meds, she could get a rash with just a few minutes of exposure. Or some people just burn easily. Not sure about that med though. See if the side affects list sun sensativity. I see you have two loved ones with Alz . . . I'm sooo sorry Sounder. I hope your are still able to enjoy your time with your mom. Dad and I have been working jig-saw puzzles. He likes to spread the glue over them after we complete them . . . we just do the 25 or 50 piece puzzles so he can enjoy the glueing each time. He doesn't really do well with the puzzle but I guide him with the pieces and we enjoy our time together. He also likes to paint figurines . . . they are quite unique!! I hope you have found some activities that mom enjoys as well. Oh, we also went for a pedicure one time, he liked that too. Let us know what you do with your mom. Blessings!


 err not sure why my font got all screwed.


 I put the name in my browser & found a site with picturs.I had a rashy type mess on my face lately,Dr thinks it was Impetago, but i didn't have the blisters.It caused my face to swell up,lips any foods I ate burned like fire,inside & out.Dr ordered Bactroban cream & it helped but still have a few hard crusted areas on my chin.Itch??OMG yes but I would just press kleenex agaisnt it & it did help.

"Resources, Daycare etc.","Hi..I am new here. My husband of 48 years has Pick's disease, we think. At any rate, his disease is progressing rather rapidly. We have been on a merry-go-round for the last 5 months. I am getting exhausted. I have visited the nearest Adult daycares that are relatively near me and they are pretty awful. I have found a very nice residence for him , but am not sure if we are ready for that yet. I am wondering what Medicare will pay for along the lines of home help and where I can find out about this. Just getting him through a shower is about more than i can manage. I fell a couple of weeks ago and I think I need surgery on my shoulder, but that's out of the question while he is home. Is there a website that addresses the Medicare issue perhaps..TIA Nanners2","He has been diagnosed..however, without an autopsy or brain biopsy, it's really not possible to differentiate the various forms of dementia. Bob also has myasthenia gravis, and has an excellent neurologist, who, because he really likes Bob, is following the progress of this other disease as well. It was the neurologist who originally thought this is Pick's disease, because of the rapid progress of the disease and also because the MRI showed damage in the frontal lobe. The psychiatrist didn't agree at first, but now she also thinks it is probably Picks...Bob also has auditory hallucinations that are not as commonly associated with Alzheimer's. We are also waiting to see if Bob will be accepted in a study that will trial a med and also include PET scans. However, that is neither here nor there..I am interested in finding some help before I am in the same boat as he is...<G> If there is a website that clearly explains Medicare benefits or other resources available, I would appreciate knowing about it. nanners


 He has NOT been diagnosed yet?A Neurologist is the best person to have.. OR,have him put in a NH, so you can have the surgery.He is no doubt ready,but you are not.Do it!You need help now.........Lynne


 Go to the Medicare website.I don't know the URL,but type it in your browser....Lynne"
The hardest part,"My grandpa has alzheimers disease. Every time I see him it gets a little worse. The hardest part is watching the effect it has on his mental health. He knows that he keeps getting a little worse. He can't put his sentences together which makes him embarassed to communicate. He often asks if someone could give him a brain. My grandpa is the greatest man in the world kind, caring, generous, and wonderful in every way. I sit back and watch this HORRIBLE thing begin to take over. I feel so helpless. I am supportive in every way but I just I could make it stop. I try not to think about this to much becasue I break down every time.","Please let me know if I am doing this correctly. It is hard to imagine, but I am a retired teacher who has never posted to a chat room. I have an 82 year old mother who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's for about 5 years. I am finding it very difficult to deal with the continual deterioration that I see almost daily. The guilt is also difficult to handle. Have I done the best for her (she now lives in a nursing home)? Is there something more I could be doing to help her and keep her from getting worse. Any ideas or suggestions would be very welcome.


 I remember the frustration watching my grandfather slowly go downhill. MY grandmother and Aunt took care of him for as long as they could. We took him to an adult day care for awhile to give them a break and it was a nice thing for them both. We did put him in a nurseing home 2 years ago. He is now tied in a wheel chair. I use to think that was awful but I also thought seeing him fall trying to climb things or just fall walking was not so great either. he doesn't seem to mind. He was quite a pest when he was first there! I walked in one day and he came running out of a room holding his head. The lady in that room apparently didn't want him there so she bopped him in the head with her cane! He was always taking things apart, toilets,doorknobs, he was very good at helping some of the woman get untied from their wheel chairs too! He still talks some. Always asks for me. He says wheres Cindy? I tell him right here and he says you aren't her. So I tell him she loves him and misses him and he seems happy with that answer. I do take some comfort in the fact that he has 5 children but it's my name he remembers. This has been so sad to watch. My grandparents raised me and I hate what this has done to both of them. My grandmother wants to go see him every night and it's getting harder to get her there. She can barely walk. But as long as her mind is good I could never take her there. I know she is afraid that her kids will want to put her there. No way. I guess she'll have to put up with me! Take care and God Bless all of you going thru this.


 It will be a year this August since I lost my grandfather to Alzheimers. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to watch. My grandfather was like my father and I've a really hard time with this. I gave a year of my life to help him and he did not even know who I was. He cried all the time. For the longest time he knew something was wrong with him but did not know what. Then we totally lost him (mentally). It really was the saddest thing I've ever seen. I think about him everyday and I am very glad I was able to be there for him as much as I was. But it still hurts. He was the greatest man I've ever know. He will always be my hero! Airy


 Yes,this is a sad disease. Especially for the person him or herself who realises they cannot remember things or say what they want. Sounds like you are a wonderful grandchild and just by being with him and understanding it makes all the difference to how he copes with his changing world. You may have to repeat yourself, to learn a type of sign language or quessing game. But just reasuring him that its not his fault could help too. Keep loving him...


 justme52 I just had to reach out to you today and let you know you are not alone. I've been lurking out there for a while, but your story got to me. When my AD mom moved in with us three years ago I also felt helpless. By calling the local Alzheimer's chapter I was put in contact with many wonderful resources, especially a local Adult Day Care Center which has proven to be a Godsend. Even though you live in a small community the closest chapter should be able to give you some suggestions over the phone. Please call them. Also, Pfizer (the company that distributes Aricept) has a wonderful program available to those of lower income. It's called Pfizer for Living Share Card and allows qualified members to purchase Aricept for $15 per month directly from the member's own pharmacy. To learn more visit www.pfizersharecard.com or call them at (800) 459-4156. My mom's insurance didn't cover her Aricept either, but Pfizer did accept her. They also have other drugs available too, such as Zoloft for $15. Hope this helps. God bless you.


 All of these posts bring back the memories of when my parents were suffering with Alzheimer's. It is a dreadful disease. I went to Alzheimer's support group meeting for quite a while and found it to be really helpful. They gave out printed materials with tips for caring for the patient. They also gave a lot of advice and insight. You could ask questions and you could share your pain with others who were going thru the same thing. I would highly reccommend the meetings.


 Just me,& anyone else.Will your Insurance pay for Reminyl??My ins.pays for my AD meds.He will go down hill faster not being on any meds.at all......."
"Alzheimer's Disease Research Study, NYU School of Medicine","Have you been concerned about your memory? We are looking for people between the ages of 40 and 90 who have been diagnosed either with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD), or people with memory complaints. We, at NYU School of Medicine’s Center for Brain Health, are conducting a study designed to identify biological markers for individuals who may be at risk for AD or currently have AD. Two abnormal lesions in the brain are the hallmarks of AD: Plaques and tangles. Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and tau are normal brain proteins that change in type and concentration in the brains of those with Alzheimer’s disease, forming plaques and tangles, which are believed to damage and shrink neurons (brain cells). Memory function is impaired when plaques and tangles form in the memory centers of the brain. The proteins can be studied in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF is a clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Studying CSF provides scientists with a “biochemical window” into the brain, because the abnormal breakdown products of APP and tau can be measured in this fluid. By studying these abnormal breakdown products in specialty laboratories, scientists can learn more about AD. In addition, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to examine structural aspects of the brain. We are looking at these two measures, CSF and MRI, in combination with performance on memory tests to develop a screening tool for early AD. Your participation and the knowledge gained from this study will assist in the development of this screen. If you would like more information about how to help, please e-mail the study coordinator at kenneth.rich@med.nyu.edu.","Moderators: This post has obtained permission to post this notice. Thanks,"
Seroquel,I will start on Seroquel tonight to keep anger & agitation down....I pray it works.......,"I'm doing better today,not as loopy as yesterday,lol. We went & ate mexican,plus i had a margarita,sure tasted good for a change.I don't drink,but do like one once in a while with supper...............


 seroquel is a wonder drug for those with alzheimers, i work in a alzheimers unit and have seen such improvement in my residents they are more willing to accept help and are more willing to participate in activities, i praise all of you that are caring for your loved ones at home keep up the good work


 Well,I had to stop the Seroquel.I was so fuzzy headed I was afraid to drive,plus my feet & ankles swelled.I do use it on a PRN basis,seems to work better that way...........


 Snowy, My Dad was diagnosed with alzheimers five years ago. Shortly after the diagnosis he began being very restless at night, He then started becoming agitated and confused fighting us to leave at all hours of the night. His doctor put him on seroquel and his outlook was much calmer. He was able to rest better. As this disease had gotten worse his seroquel dose has increased. Hope it works well for you


 I have been on Seroquel one week,I'm doing great,I'm me again,lol I start back to therapy today............


 THANKS, WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING THAT CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MY FATHER. NEXT DOC APP WILL ASK. THANKS AGAIN"

 Great idea Snowy!! Lyn, dad and I are doing well. We are painting ceramics and still doing puzzles. He is going downhill faster than I expected, but at this point he is actually more compliant and easier to manage because he has quit worrying about bank accounts, income and the car and all. He is very sweet!! Blessings!


 Lyn, I just wanted to let you know that you've been in my thoughts and prayers and hoping you feel better very soon!! Hugs, Teri :)


 Snowy ........I asked Howie for one lol,so I am guessing I will have one soon ........spoiled I am lol..........thanks all for your concern luv and support it is what made me better and able to come home .........no meds can do what the ""family"" here does for your spirit, body and soul..........God Bless and Be Well.......Lyn


 Why not have your cake I eat it too,lol.??


 Judy (Effie) made several phone calls trying to reach Lyn, Howie or Cait. Cait returned her call and gave the following information about Lyn: She said her mom is back in the hospital in Chatham. However, they expect that she will be transferred to the hospital in London; this city has excellent teaching hospitals. Cait said her mom is doing better and should be out of the hospital the first week of August. Judy . . . a milllion thanks for checking on our sister!! Cait . . . thanks for getting back to Judy . . . we do worry about each other. Lyn . . . I'm so glad that you are being well cared for. I hope your docs don't release you before you are well enough to be home. Judy and I wanted to start this topic to ask for prayers for Lyn's recovery and comfort and to update everyone who has been concerned about you. Thank you Father for watching over our dear sister Lyn. Please continue to bless Lyn, Cait and Howie, and Lyn's parents who are dealing with her mom's Alzheimers. Father I pray that other family members and friends have been convicted to help care for Lyn's mom so that her dad and Lyn can be freed from the worry and stress that comes from too few caregivers. In Jesus' precious name . . . Amen. Hugs, Prayers and Blessing!


 Lyn, you take care of yourself, we'll be soooo looking forward to hearing from you once again!! You are in my prayers! Hugs, Teri :)


 Howie!! you are such a dear to keep us posted!! I copied your message from the Chrohns forum and pasted it in the Forum Moderators board and the Anxiety board. So glad Lyn has such a loving family taking care of her!!! Give her a big hug from Rosie!! Prayers, hugs, and Blessings!


 Hey Lyn!! I hope you are feeling much better these days . . . still thinking about you every day. Give us a quick update when you feel up to it. Prayers, Hugs and Blessings!

 Dear Lyn, I hope you do get a lap top. I got one shortly after I got sick. It makes such a difference, I can keep my legs elevated and type. I think of you everyday and if it is okay with you, I will give you a quick call when you are up to a little chat. Hope it was okay that I called when you were in the hospital. Rosie emailed me and asked if I had heard from you. I did not mean for Cait to call me back, other than collect. I am sorry she did not call collect. I spoke to her for a very short time. I am so glad that you are feeling a bit better. How is your son doing? How is your mom? How is Cait? Congradulations btw on her award. She must be such a wonderful daughter. She sounded like a doll on the phone. I am glad that your sibs are helping out with your mom. I think that is what you said. Please take care. Keeping you in my prayers and all of your family. I will never forget that you were there for me on day one. God Bless, Judy


 .Hey Snowy totally agree and we are going to look at a laptop on Saturday (not that I am planning on going back to hospital) ,besides the nurses would all quit lol....Take care and say hello to Larry, God Bless .......Lyn"

I can not imagine how you do all that you do. You are so busy and dedicated to everything you do. You give everything 100%. Now someone up above is telling u that u need to give 100% to taking care of Lyn. Please, please do. I am so looking forward to our cup of tea or coffee. Perhaps some time this summer and if Cait likes to swim, I could bring her over to my sisters for a nice swim in her pool, with u and Howie of course. Another member and her husband are talking about coming up this summer and spending a couple of days with Martin and I. I am sure you know her. I know she thinks highly of you. Anyway her husband wants to take in a show, like a live performance and dinner one night, and all going well perhaps you, Cait and Howie could join us. It would be neat for some of us HW members to finally meet. No pressure though. If you want we could just stick to original plan and have coffee or tea here, or at a local restaurant that is fine too!!!! Please forgive my ignorance but what is pg? Do not rush back to respond. Maybe rosie will be able to tell me. She is a good friend to you and such a lovely, caring person. Rest, drink lots of fluids and let Howie and Cait spoil u. And it sounds like its time for your family to play a more active role with your mom too. They never hesitate to ask your parents when they need something. Take care. I will keep you in my prayers and I will do my best to answer a few posts with a shortened version to my normal ramble. God bless you now and always and keep u safe in his ever loving care. judy Post Edited (effie) : 6/23/2005 9:01:33 PM (GMT-6)


 Dear Howie, Lyn and Cait, Thank you for taking the time Howie to respond. I trust you will take care of Lyn and insist that she rests. I too am looking forward to our get together. My husband is a teacher so anytime in July or August would be best for us. but right now the most imortant thing is for Lyn to get better. thanks for filling me in on what PG is. It sounds awful. If you could tell me the first name fo Lyn's son I will pray for him. That is awful that both him and Lyn have to be going through an unnecessary stress. I will pray for all of you. Your wife is one special lady. I will pray for a speedy recovery and wisdom for the doctors to take care of her and give her the bat pssible care. Lyn is very fortunate to have you, and you her. We all love her. She is such a deeply caring and understanding person. I have to run now to make it in time for a physical. i will write mroe later. I just wanted to say thanks and please keep us up to date on her condition. May god bless all of you. sincerely, Judy/effie p.s. please let me know if I can call her on the phone and what would be the best time to do this. Once again thanks, take care judy/effiey


 Effie, I see that Howie filled you in on the PG. *Rosie shudders* I never looked at the pics . . . uh uh. I would if I could help bandage or take care of them, but not just to peek. I have marveled many times at the wonderful peope, like you Effie and Lyn, that we meet here. Sounds wonderful that you are getting together with some of the HW family!!!! I hope you'l make a post about it aftword. I met HW Laura for B'fast one morning!! It is really nice to have a face for our friends here. Hmmmmm wonder if we could have HW year book online!! Take care Effie, Lyn and Howie!!! Lyn, I hope you are resting!! Blessings!


 Dear Lyn, Rosie and Howie and Cait, It is the wee hours of Sunday morning and as I sit here meditating, wondering what today will bring, I think of all of you. With a smile on my face and peace in my heart, I think of all of the new friends I have made on HW. I pray Lyn that you have gotten some rest. I pray that somehow your body is healing and that the doctors will find God’s wisdom to guide them to make the right decisions so that you can be healed once and for all. I pray that you will not have to go through this “PG” again, and that all of your other health issues will be cured. I pray for you to find the strength to get through this. I pray for your family that God will give them courage too. I pray for your mom and dad and siblings. I pray for your siblings to learn to see the joy that they will receive in giving of their time to help take care of your parents. I pray that they will awaken and remember how fortunate they are to have living parents. I know that your path along the journey of life has been far from easy. Yet, who was the first to reach out to me in one of my darkest moments. It was not my sisters, or one of my friends that I had thought I had been close to for more than 30 years. It was YOU! Lyn, reached out to me and shared a hand and promised to be a friend. Your beautiful words of encouragement brought me to tears. How could this total stranger understand my pain so well? I believe that the Lord brought you to me. I hope that I can somehow comfort you the way you comforted me. You are so loved by so many people. You give and give and give. You meet people from all different roads of life, and yet I have never seen you judge or be harsh. You are kind and sweet and honest. You are a disciple and an angel all in one. You give from your heart, to your family and to so many people here at HW. You give wise advice. You share your endless patience. You rarely take time off from your commitments. You are a hard worker. You are truly a beautiful person. I am blessed to have met you and honoured to call you friend. Rosie, always Rosie, your name describes you perfectly. Despite all the twists and turns you have gone through in your own life, you are there, offering help to others. I feel like I know you so well. After I met Lyn, I met you one day. You reached out to me when I was feeling insecure about the posts I was writing. I was worried that by sharing my own stories, I was boring people and writing too much. Yet you did not dismiss my worries. You somehow knew how much I really was worried about this. You wrote me kind words of encouragement and reassured me that my words were fine. You promised me that it was okay to share my stories and that perhaps in telling them, someone would find something useful. I was not just wasting space on the site. You embraced me and made me feel like I was part of the HW family. I admired you so much. I had seen how often your words had helped others. Your wisdom, patience and faith were there to guide others. People from all different walks of life and people who had so many different life experiences. You never judged any one. Your words were kind and uplifting. They oozed out love for mankind. Both you and Lyn will never truly know how many lives you have touched or saved. How many people’s days were a little or a lot brighter because of the words you wrote to them. One can easily see how close you two sisters are. They say twos company, threes a crowd. Yet you have never made me feel like I was invading that very special place the two of you have found with each other. You have invited me to share your friendship. You are both confident and strong. You fear not inviting others into your world. I am blessed to be a small part of that world. If I could have three wishes right now they would be that all here at HW would get better, that all HW families would be safe and strong and that Rosie you could come for our tea party. Oh how I would love to meet you. I do not even know where you live, but I wish somehow we could all get together for a lovely cup of friendship. Well my dear friends I will bid adieu for now. I will keep you close in my heart and prayers. Judy/effie


 OH Judy, I just now read your post. You are so kind. I've been feeling a bit down this week . . . thought I was really past that, but one of my most fun adventures, backpacking, has been out of the question at least temporarily. I was invited a few days ago to go on a 4 day hike with my son and his wife. I was honored that they would want a 52 year old along with them, but they do seem sincere. Anyway you mesage is so kind and uplifting. Thank you sis. Timing was perfect. BTW: I chose my name because my cheeks are ""Always Rosie"". It is the classic butterfly rash of lupus, which brightens with sun exposure. I get the same rash on my arms, neck and v of neck if I don't cover up real well in the sun. So, if you see a plump, 52 year, old blond walking around with long sleeves, collar up, hat and backpack on, that is likely me! Oh . . . I live in Ohio and am east of Cleveland, 1/2 mile from Lake Erie. Toronto is about 4 hour drive from here. All my relatives live in Ontario. Most are in Penetang and Midland (on Georgian Bay). Small world!! Thanks for the encouragement sis!! I enjoy your posts as well!! Blessings!


 Oh . . . God bless you Lyn. I'm glad you are taking care of yourself. You should stretch that bedrest out too. When you start doing the next day, remember do a little and then rest!! You do too much. I'll watch the AD board for you sis!!! I'm check in here most days anyway. Rest well sis!! Blessings!


 .......I am so happy that my wife has people that care,she gets worried when she cannot fulfill her time on here,....her crohns in flare plus the PG is not good , I had to basically force her to the hospital .......Always Rosie ,Lyn thinks highly of you and embraces you as a dear friend ,thanks for being here all the times you are for her ....as she always says God Bless ..........Howie (lyn's hubby)..........Jusy we are looking forward to meeting up and doing whatever it dont matter it would be nice to meet for sure ,PG is pyoderma gangrenosum a rare skin/blood disorder that when she is stressed or crohns flares she will break out in really horrid painful skin sores ,look like ulcers and go right down to the bone ,she almost lost her finger ,the last time she broke out .......Maybe Rosie could find the thread with her pics on it for you to see how bad it gets .....she is really stressed right now as her son is going thru a nasty seperation and his ex took the kids and he is so attached to them it is ripping him and her apart ,so I think this is partly what has caused the breakout and flare ,....thanks for your concern and help ..looking forward to meeting up with yous in person .......taks care and God Bless ......(lyn always signs off that way lol)...Howie and Cait


 Judy,thanks for everything the best time to call would probably be Sun night after 8 pm ok ,you take care as well and she is sleeping pretty soundly ,am and have pt my foot down this time lol ..be good and thanks again ..Howie


 Always Rosie,thanks for all your kind words and concern ,she is still in bed (or just gone back ) she posted on Mod forum ,is still in pain and very tired but hopes to be back with all by tomorrow.............................Judy and us have plans to hook up in toronto and it will be great to put a face to the name lol,have lunch and visit ......take care and hope you are well ...........Howie ,Lyn and Cait


 Dear Lyn, I have just spent some time researching PG. I am so sorry. I had no idea you were going through something so potentially serious. I wish I could just come over and move in and take care of you and your family. Please let me know if there is anything we can do. If there are doctors in Toronto that can treat this better, please feel free to book the appointment and you and Howie and Cait can stay in our guest bedroom. I had an excellent dermatologist when I had the palmar pustular psorasis on my hands and feet. That could get quite bad. I found buying Kling wrap in bulk, and using some of the more old fashioned treatments like, ""burosol"" really helped. I actually read one article that said sometimes nicotine gum helps with your condition. I hope you are seeing the best doctors Lyn. You really need to take the time to let your body rest and reduce your exposure to unwell people. I will be calling you in a couple of hours, if you are up to talking. If not, trust me I will understand. You are in my prayers. Your son remains in my prayers as do your mom and dad and of course Howie and Cait. Sincerely, judy/effie"
GUARDIANSHIP,"I need help. Family members are trying to take my father away from me because they want his assets. I'v taken care of my mother and father for the last 7 years. My mom died last year and I don't have to be a genius to know that if I wasn't here my father might not be alive today. Not because it was me but because someone, anyone was there to comfort and love him. I've taken care of this man with no help not a stitch from the people that wan't to put my father in I don't know where. I have a court date in about three weeks and I need a lawyer that is knowledgable of the situation and understands that I feel my father might fall apart completely if he is taken to unfamiliar surroundings without someone to relate to. I will do whatever is humanly possible to stop this insanity! If you know how I feel please help me.","SUE, I'M FROM BROOKLYN,NEW YORK AND I KNOW MY FAMILYS INTENTIONS BECAUSE I WAS SERVED WITH THE PAPERS THIS WEEK. HOWEVER, THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND WORDS, THEY ARE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AS I FEEL VERY ALONE. I AM PREPARED TO GO THE WHOLE NINE YARDS AND FIGHT FOR MY FATHER. IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR THAT THEY CAN'T OR WON'T REALIZE WHAT TAKING MY FATHER OUT OF HIS SAFETY ZONE WILL DO TO HIM. LIKE I ALWAYS SAY IT COULD BE WORSE AND I HAVE A STRONG FAITH THAT THINGS WILL WORK OUT, I HAVE TO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS I WILL FOLLOW UP ON THEM


 THANKS FOR THE NICE WORDS. I GLAD YOUR FAMILY HAS THE DECENCY TO GIVE YOU THE SUPPORT YOU DESERVE. WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE YOU LEARN SO MUCH about YOURSELF. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU GIVE BUT WHAT YOUR GETTING FROM THESE SITUATIONS. I FEEL SORRY FOR MY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO SHARE PART OF THEIR FATHERS LIFE THAT THEY WILL NEVER KNOW. YES IT CAN BE TEDIOUS. YES MY POP IS A PAIN IN THE ASS SOMETIMES. YES, I WISH I WAS IN VEGAS SOMETIMES BUT THAT'S LIFE. I KNOW GOD IS WITH ME, HE HAS GIVEN ME THE STRENGHI OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS TO KEEP AT IT. HE WILL NOT ABABDON ME NOW I KNOW IT.


 I'd be finding a better lawyer.Too bad you didn't get POA at the beginning,you wouldn't be having this problem now.............


 GOOD NEWS. A DIFFERENT ATTORNEY FROM THE SAME FIRM TOOK OVER THE CASE AND HE IS 200X BETTER THAN THE PRIOR ATTORNEY. HE'S PISSED OFF AT WHAT'S GOING ON, AND THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED. MY FATHER'S INCOMPETANT COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR THE LAST HEARING, SO THE CASE IS POSTPHONED UNTIL END OF NOVEMBER. MY FATHER'S ATTORNEY IS A REAL BOTTTOM FEEDER. I ALWAYS SAY YOU CAN'T GET WHAT YOU WANT BUT YOU ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU NEED. HOPEFULLY, WITH ANOTHER 5 WEEKS TO GO I CAN PULL AN ACE OUT OF MY SLEEVE, AND I THINK I CAN. WILL POST RESULTS.


 Hi MikeyB. I am so sorry for the situation that you have found yourself in.I am no expert so i can only make suggestions for you to consider but as i am in Britain and i don't know where you are from then even these may not be of help to you.I will do my best though. If it was me i would first of all go to your fathers doctor and discuss things with him or her.Will the doctor agree with you that your father would fall apart by being removed from the family home.My mother in law has dementia and i know that if she is taken away from her reguler routine and surroundings then she too would becme more confused and stressed.Things like being able to find the bathroom is a big thing for an Alzheimers patient.Also,and this may seem strange,but you need to be able to prove in court that you have lived with and taken care of your father for the last 7 years.Is it you that has always gone along with your father for hospital apointments etc,maybe you can get the doctor to give written proof of this. Do you have a citizans advice centre or similer that you can go to? here they will be able to give you advice on the legal(sp?)side of things that you will need to have in court.Here in Britain we also have an organization called ""help the aged""these people can be a great sorce of information and advice. You say that your family has not helped at all in the care of your father but now want his assets,you will probably also need proof of this as well.Unfortunatly although you know what their intentions are they may be telling a different story,such as ""Oh Mike has been living with our father rent free for this long and now it is our turn to have some benefit of Dads assets."" It is a difficult situation i know,and i do feel like my suggestions are a bit feeble for such a huge problem so i realy do hope that someone else will come along here that realy knows what they are talking about and will give you some advice. Please post again and let us know how things progress,i can only say that i will be thinking of you. Sue


 Hi there mikeyb, I live in Canada, but I also take care of my father who has dementia.. unlike you my family is only to happy to allow me to care for my father and they are there to advise me or support my decisions. My advise to you is to get in touch with your local Alzheimer association. They can be a wealth of information and assistance to you, possiobly even recommend a lawyer. Go through and collect any papers you may have that show you doing the careing for the last 7yrs, if you have any Power of Attor. signed with the banks or your parents for personal P.A. get your copies ready. Lastly Pray, I find it helps me when I need strength and assistance for the major thing. God Bless. Mary-Lin


 GUARDIANSHIP COURT IS THE ORIGINAL KANGAROO COURT. NOW THE NEUTRAL LAWYERS ARE ALL FEEDING OFF MY FATHERS ASSETS, ""FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT"". MY LAWYER IS THE WORST OF ALL, DOESN'T KNOW A THING. THIS IS A HORROR SHOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED INTO. I HOPE I'M EXAGERATING. I WAKE UP EVERYDAY WITH A KNOT IN MY STOMACH. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF CARING FOR MY FATHER, HIM NOT BEING SICK ONE DAY, HASN'T LOST NOT ONE POUND, THEY ARE MAKING ME OUT TO BE THE EVIL SON. I TELL YOU, THIS WHOLE SYSTEM SHOULD BE EXPOSED FOR WHAT IS REALLY IS AND THAT IS A WAY FOR IGNORANT LAWYERS WHO CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE A LIVING IN THE COMPETITIVE WORLD, LEACH ON TO POOR SUCKERS LIKE MY FATHER WHO THEY DEEM CAN'T FEND FOR THEMSELVES. THIS IS TRULY THE LOWEST THE LEGAL PROFESSION HAS STEPPED DOWN TO. I'M SO FRUSTRATED BUT I PRAY AND I KNOW I'VE SONE NO WRONG AND THAT GOD IS MY SAVIOR. THAT'S ALL I CAN DO AT THIS POINT IS TAKE THE BALL IN MY OWN HANDS AND HAVE FAITH THAT I WILL BE GUIDED IN RIGHT DIRECTION.


 don't have the resources to change attorneys but have been trying to light the fire under his ass. i've spent the last few days trying to get papers together-at this point all i want to make sure of is that my father stays with me. he still is a viable person who takes care of himself and i wouldn't want what's left of his life to be cut short. you can always make money but i only have one father. there is something inside me, maybe my faith in God that tells me everything will be alright and i going with it. What's the sense of projecting, i really do know what will happen. i'll know monday or we'll keep fighting. i post the outcome"
Does caring for another person ever get easier?,"Hi there. I am happy to find this site. I recently started caring for my mom, she has alzheimers. There is so much to do. How does a person keep up? I stopped going to school for a year, but it is time to get back. I work part-time as a substitute teacher, married and have 3 young children of my own. I just moved her (my mom) from California to Texas a month ago. She is staying in an apartment across the street from my house. This way she can still live on her own and I can keep an eye on her. I am never sure when to check on her. I have not found the correct timing thing yet. Sometimes I am with her so much, I get nothing accomplished at home! If I declare it a home day to get something done, I feel guilty for not spending the day with her and wondering every minute if she is all right? It seems like I am always a few chores behind! Bills,food, laundry to name a few for two households is hard to get done. Does it get easier?? I do not see how? I have contacted my local chapter, I start in a support group next week. I will also find out about adult daycare then. Any tips somebody has will be happily tried.","Thank-you for your reply. I am going to check into getting a POA today. I manage her money so I can pay her bills for her. I'm still triing to get her moved into her apartment!! Got to get going now.


 No,it never gets easier,only worse.Just pop in on her,as you NEED to know how she's doing. You will need to start delegating your workload to others in the family,so you can have more time with your Mom.What all can she still do?Can she set her medicines up or do you do that? Hopfully she is on a medication for Alzheimer's(AD). She may resist you on going to daycare,but try to get her to go.If she pitches a fit,as some do,you may not get her there..................... Do you have power of attorney on her?If not you need to get one drawn up,get her tosign it in front of a notory,plus witnesses.Durable power of attorney is best,it covers everything,as you will be taking care of her,plus anything to do with her money.......


 I check chat every day no one ever is there. Why not set a time say like 2 pm & 7 pm? Any other ideas??"
conditions/diseases  that show similar symptoms as alzheimer's?,"My father was first diagnosed with alzheimer's, but has now been told that he doesn't have the disease, but the doctor does not know what it is. Does anyone know of any other conditions or diseases that can have similiar symptoms?","He has seen both.


 I did some research on that and these are the symptoms associated with it: * shortness of breath * fatigue * pallor * rapid heart rate * loss of appetite * diarrhea * tingling and numbness of hands and feet * sore mouth * unsteady gait, especially in the dark * tongue problems * smell, impaired * gums, bleeding * positive Babinski's reflex * loss of deep tendon reflexes * personality changes, ""megaloblastic madness"" My dad's symptoms are a little different. They include mostly confusion and forgetfulness


 Oh,yes all that too,in some people,not all.............


 Not all who have Alzheimer's have seizures,maybe 5% do........


 For wide consumption, Lynne lives with the disease and is also a retired health professional. I hope folks who didn't know that will bear it in mind. For the OP: I would suggest having your father dx'd by a specialist in the dementing diseases. This is a sometimes arduous process of tests, interviews and the taking of a family geneological medical history. In our case, the process took about 3 months and a little over 100 hours of tests and intervews. The final dx was vascular dementia. My mom is also hypothyrodic and changes in her thryroid meds definitely has improved her condition. One question: Does your father routinely make new memory? Can he learn a new task? Pat


 was it the family dr.or neurologist who saw him?? A neurologist is who tests for ad...................


 Pernisous Anemia,also an out of whack thyroid.........


 What about seizure activity? I have simple partial seizures that don't cause blackouts or convulsions, just memory loss, gait unsteadiness, vertigo, loss of smell or taste.


 He has never had any seizures.


 I don't appreciate at smart Alect,do you? There are approx,50 diseases that can cause dementia."
"Confused, upset, don't know what to do","Hi, My mother-in-law moved in with us this past July, after the police called us and said they had found her about 45 miles from here. She didn't know where she was going or how she got there, other then to know that she drove her car. We were lucky she didn't get hurt or hurt someone else. We didn't relize that she had gotten that bad before then. Never know what she is going to say about living here. She doesn't think she has been her since July, just a few days. Sometimes she thinks we are just staying at someone's house and that they will be mad when they come home. Then she may say that she is renting this house. Every night we have to aruge about taking her meds, she says that she doesn't take any at night, then we have to show her the bottle, then she will say the doctor never told her how to take them. At night, she allways thinks that her sister is here. One funny thing she does is, most every night she drinks a small glass of wine (she has for many years) for some reason she doesn't want us to see her so she gets up and goes to get it after she thinks we are asleep. Anyways I can deal with all of that stuff. The problem is with her personal care. She had a colosimy in 2000 and she makes a mess at times with it. She gets poop on her cloths, shoes, floor, everywhere. When she does she says it's not from her, or that it is not poop on her, it's just some dirt she must of brushed up to. My wife will ask to let her help to clean her up and to change her bag. 9 out of 10 times that will start a fight between them. They start yelling, calling each other names, and the last few times mom has kicked at my wife. Today it went on for an hour. My wife starts crying and says she can't do it anymore. Then she will go check and she is still standing in the bathroom and hasn't done anything and with no bag on, getting poop all over. And they go at it again. I can't help mom, she WON""T let me because I'm a man, plus half the time she doesn't remember who I am anyways. Then a bit latter my wife I went out and I asked her (mom) about them fighting and she said they don't fight, she is her best freind and she wouldn't fight with her. I aked her why she won't ley my wife help her with her bag, she clams my wife never has asked to help her and she doesn't need any help anyways because she knows how to take care of herself. I just don't know what to do anymore. Fred","Would like an update,how are things going Fred??


 Has she been diagnosed by a Neurologist?Is she on AD meds?Sounds like she needs something for agitation,hallucinations,or is she on something for that? If she keeps this up,maybe it's time to place her,like it or not. That's alot of stress on everyone..............


 IMO, time for LTC. Her QOL, and other's, is suffering..... To be honest, if I were in your situation, my wife is much more important to me than my mother. You'll have to decide for yourself. Pat"
Hi I'm A Newbie Here!,"Just wanted to say hi to everyone. Belonged to another message board for Alzheimers. My mom who is 85 today has had this disease for many years now and has been in a nursing home for the last year and a half. Today is a little harder on me, probably because it is her birthday. My mom's mother and father both died from this disease as has two of her siblings. Another sister got alzheimers after my mom did but got worse much faster and is now in a nursing home too. Just wanted to say hi and give you a little of my background. Hope to talk to some of you soon! CandyJane","Hi Candyjane and Lynne! I feel like I'm running all over creation joining AD sites! Just wanted to check in and say hello; I am new here, I', 59, and I have a 90 year old Mother who is in a locked AD facility in Fla. It has been a very rocky road, but she seems to have finally adjusted. Just like to stay connected to others and try to support and listen to the trials and miseries of this disease. Hope to see others from our dying board here. Love, Gladness


 Hello all, Happy birthdyay mom!!! My dad has AD never thought of checking a site like this. I post on the Lupus boards here - but just started a few days ago. will be looking around for some good ideas. We are at a point where we are trying to find things for dad to do. He is still at home with mom but can do 1st grade projects. He seems to enjoy ""helping me"" with my stuff. see ya round the boards.


 Hi Lynne, Gladnesss and Pat. So happy you're all here. Saw you mention this board Lynne so knew I had found you!! Gladness so glad to see you here too much while checking to see what some of these things did here put you on my ignore list by accident. Maybe Lynne can tell me how to correct what I just did!! Would never ignore you Gladness, that's for sure. Need to get used to these boards and these eyes of mine have a hard time making out some of the icons etc. Hi to you Pat also. Even though CandyJane is my user name wanted to let everyone know it was Pat also, but since there were so many Pats and Patricia's on the other board just left it as CandyJane. So now you know I'm Pat too but won't use it if it's going to mix everyone up. I'm mixed up enough on the new board right now for everyone!!! LOL I'll get the hang of it eventually!! Hugs to you all, CandyJane


 Hello Ladies & Gents.......Finally made it here......Looking forward to chatting with everyone........ Take Care.......Love, Donna


 Hello CandyJane Sorry today was such a rough one for you. Make yourself a cup of tea and turn on some soft music and just try and relax. Take some deep breaths also. I will touch base with you later as I am dealing AD with my parents. treelady


 Thanks PixieDustStorm for telling me how to get my friends taken off the ignore list. I did it. Gee how easy it is once someone gives you the info!!!! LOL Hopefully I won't mess up again but now know their are people like you out there who will help if I do mess up. Thanks so much!! CandyJane


 Hey,Candy Jane,glad you made it.It's me,Lynne63 from the other board......


 Hey Gladness.Glad to see you...........


 As Lynne is so fond of saying: Wwhheeeeeeeee!!!!! Let's see how long I last here Pat


 I know how to do the ignore,BUT not how to undo it,lol........


 Hi Donna, Just posted you on the old board to let you know I had seen you on one of these boards. Glad we're finding each other!! CandyJane


 CandyJane - To unignore someone, go to the Control Panel and it says there's an option to take off any blocks."
To Pat...,"Hi Pat, Thanks for the post and advise. Today my dad is bringing my mom (who has AD) over to visit so am glad that we will be able to spend some time together. Since she loves visiting her so much my dad has been bringing her here to visit instead of having us go to the nursing home. She still enjoys looking around at everything and having lunch with my husband and I and of course there is always some surprise waiting for her when she comes. Since I know her state of mind can change at anytime, try to do all the things I know she enjoys doing and try to make as memories as I can for the future. She has had alzheimers for many years now (longer than any other member of her family) but because the Namenda and Aricept have made her happier and more loving am trying to enjoy every moment she is where she is today. Best wishes to you and yours. Write to me anytime. CandyJane",That's great Candy
New member - quick question,"Hello! I've been looking for something like this because there's soooooo much information on Alzheimer's and it can be confusing. Especially when the information I read doesn't match up with what I'm seeing. My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a yearish ago, although I've been seeing signs of it for at least 5 years. I had a question for y'all: A month or so ago, my grandmother fell out of bed and hurt her back. She went to the ER and they gave her pain killers. After she started taking those, she seems to be declining at an alarming rate. She couldn't walk by herself, couldn't figure out how to stand up, etc. Plus, her back was killing her, so that didn't make anything easier. So, they went back to the emergency room and the doctor gave her a pain patch on top of another strong painkiller. Long story short, she ended up in the hospital for a few days. They were giving her too much, and she was confused and not eating. After the medicine was out of her system she was back to her normal self. Anywho, that gave us a glimpse of what she may be like in the near future. So, my grandfather and mother were looking into Alzheimer facilities were my grandmother could go for a few hours maybe once a week, just so they could have some down time (I try to go to their house as much as possible, but my grandmother always has to know where my grandfather is, so it's not much of a break for him). Soooooooo, my question is, how do we get her prepared for a day stay at the facility? Would they let me go with her until she felt more comfortable there? I don't think she'll handle it well, just because she'll be away from her husband. When I take her out for a manicure or whatever, the whole time she's worried that he doesn't know where she is or something'll happen to him. So even though the break would be great for him, would the stress be too much for her to handle? I'm reading a book on Alzheimer's right now, and it's saying that stress + Alzheimer's = BIG NO NO! Sorry for rambling... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","She's on Rimyl, I think it's called, and she's also participating in a drug study for something else that I don't know the name of. But we don't know if she's getting the drug or the placebo. And she's on Zoloft for depression. I don't know if she takes anything else.


 ****Soooooooo, my question is, how do we get her prepared for a day stay at the facility? Would they let me go with her until she felt more comfortable there?*** IMO, tell her as little as possible about the details. Perhaps mention the doctor ordered some ""tests"" or ""therapy"". The staff at the facility will know how to handle her. BTW, what pain meds did they give her? Pat


 Thanks for the info. Glad she appears to be having a good time at day care. Sometimes change is rough. Some pain meds can exacerbate dementia. It might be a good idea to research that and speak to the staff the next time she needs pain control meds. My mom had breast cancer surgery under a local (at my insistance) and I spent a goodly amount of time with the surgeon and anesthesiologist making clear that, in order for them to do the surgery, they needed to follow certain protocols regarding mom's dementia. They didn't particularly like it, but those were my terms. She had no ill effects from the sedation and pain meds they gave her. Just something to keep in mind for the future. Many meds which don't bother us can really bother a dementia patient and often the effects aren't reversible. Hope everything continues to go smoothly. That's the best gift Pat


 Pat, thank you so much. I knew that about pain medication, but not about anesthetics, though. We only learned about the bad effects of pain medication after the medication had already messed her up. Luckily, that was reversable. But the nerologist she saw at the hospital explained why it happened (we just thought she was progressing quickling with the AD). I trust him, because he's also my nerologist. This is the main reason why I joined this community. I need to know more about Alzheimer's so can help prevent something like this from happening again. I'm glad everything went good for your mom's surgery. SnowLynne, that's wonderful your doctors were so understanding and willing to work with you. How's your arm doing now?


 <i>If a person is predisposed to AD,not much you can do to stop it.</i> Stop what? How'd you tear your rotator cuff? Pain medication, even over the counter stuff, makes me feel strange, so I try not to take them. I find that a nap cures any headache, backache, any ache that I have except for my hand pain, which I have a prescription for, though I have yet to take it because the side effects scare me.


 eeks! sound rather painful. My doctor just diagnosed me with osteoarthritis, too. I don't believe him, though.


 I've had pain in my wrists since I was 17 (I'm 20 now). I don't believe the diagnosis because he didn't tell me, he let the pharmacy tell me, which I think is strange. So I'm going to my normal doctor Wednesday to see what she thinks about this. If she tells me I have it, then I'll believe her.


 You don't say if she's on any AD meds,or antidepreeeants,is she on anything??


 Reminyl is a good medication.


 Thanks for the tip. I was a little late in my post, however. I haven't been over to their house in about a week and a half (I know, I'm horrible... but it was my last week before school/work/workouts start again and I got a bit distracted). She went either Monday or Wednesday, and my mom and grandfather went with her. The facility had a lunch and then they did bowling. She had a great time and met two new people. She went again Wednesday by herself. Papa said that she was a little upset on the way there, but the staff said she had a great time and she seemed happy when she was telling me about it. They put her on a pain patch and gave her pills. I think the patch was Demeroll and the pills were vicodin. I'm not certain, but that sounds familar. She's not on them anymore.


 Aug.30 last year I had my rotator cuff in my shoulder repaired,it had a tear in it.Larry & I (hubby) had a heart to heart with the surgeon,& his anethsiologist about AD & anesthetcs,they were great They were going to do the surgery with a local,but it had been 2 yrs.since they had done it that way,& still keep me relaxed ect.It all came out fine,I'm fine arm is great,was diamissed from the surgeon yesterday,YAHOOOOO!! My mind is as good as it was before surgery.


 See,I can raise it this high.135 degrees. If a person is predisposed to AD,not much you can do to stop it. I do not like pain meds.I refuse them,& take tylenol pnly.Pain meds tear up my gut,cause awful headaches.I do have a high tolerance for pain,which is in my favor.


 lol,my hubby helped me up from a low spot,& my rotator cuff snapped. My primary Dr.blew it off as tendonitis,I said it's the rotator cuff.He disagreed.Told my Neurologist about it,he put me in therapy,after a month,the therapist agreed I needed something else.I got an appt.with a Orthoprdic surgeon,he did x-rays(primary said nothing would show,ha!) X-ray did show something,then an MRI was done,the surgeon told me I was right there was a tear in the rotator cuff,like I said. The rest is history. I also have severe Osteoporosis,plus Osteoarthritis I have had since I was 25.


 You will when the pain hits.............."
Stages???,"Hello everyone, I am new here and my mom has alzheimer's. I am the only one in the family that cares for her. She is still able to live alone, but only because her neighbors upstairs check on her like family. I have seen a rapid decline in her as of late. Although she does not wander, there is little that she can do for herself. She can no longer cook or wash, and sometimes mixes up the shampoo and conditioner. Just this weekend she wanted me to see her caller-ID to ask me how she was going to PAY that phone bill???? She just could no longer understand what it is used for. I do everything as I said, and it is becoming harder and harder as I am on disability for Lupus and a host of other autoimmune diseases. She is not ready for a nursing home..but not far from that if anyone here understands what I mean. She has enough of her mind to know that things are not right.....I hate this illness, and I do the best I can. WHAT are the stages...DO they go from one to another rapidly?? HOW do you get others in the family to do even the little things. I take care of all of her bills, and shopping, doctors, and anything unusual that comes up. I have kept her at my home for as much as 2wks at a time trying to heal leg wounds. You would think my sister would be MORE interested in helping as my mom was a loving mother and deserves nothing but the best. I do all pick ups of her medication as she as COPD as well. I did hire her neighbors to administer her meds, as I was not able to keep up the pace of driving there 2x a day..NOW she cannot figure out how to open the cans of ensure. I make her sandwiches and bring them 3x a week, and I order her out her favorite foods. Sorry to make this so long. Right now I have all the care AT home that I can get for her, but I am afraid of what is to come. I appreicate any communication here and support. Really..MANY thanks in advance!!!! Hope","Hello Hope. My mother in law has dementia and because she can afford it she now has a full time carer living with her,so her day to day needs are taken care of such as meals,washing etc.The thing is though that there are other things that have to be taken care of decisions that the carer can not take responsability for.It is important that all the family get to gether and decide who can do what and when,it makes things so much easier when everyone will pull together and do there bit. Would it be possable for you to have a family meeting,and basicaly put your cards on the table and tell your family that you just can not cope with this situation on your own and,can they all pull together and get a rota together so it takes the pressure of you.(Are they aware of your illness?)As far as advice on the dementia i am afraid that i am as green as you are.It seemes to be a case of taking each day at a time as in my experiance it is very difficult to predict what the next stage will be. Hopefully someone else on here will be able to advice better than me. Bag Lady"
Need Help-Please answer this Alzheimer poll...,"I am a student working on a project that deals with a tracking and medical monitoring of Alzheimer's patients. I am wondering if anyone has heard of such a product and/or if you think it would be useful and beneficial, or intrusive and unethical. The device can track location while monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, and if a person has fallen. The device automatically notifies emergency personnel if the user is in danger. Any feedback would be graetly appreciated. Thank you. The poll question is: What do you think about this device?","I voted yes. Does that mean I can share in the bucks you are going to make with this:) During your research, have you found anything anywhere that says one of the fist symptoms in Alzheimers is not being able to recognize yourself in the mirror??? Makes sense also. Also is it true that an Alzheimers patient regresses to childhood, and are communicative skills best started right at the time of diagnosis? I have a friend whose father is in the nursing home and he is still good at his numbers. So he uses the flash ccards with him on each visit. Your tracking devise sounds great. But I would keep it off the boards for now. You don't want anyone stealing your idea. And a great idea at that. Referring back to my friends father. He is as I said in a nursing home and he was found out on the main highway. Go for it girl. The greatest of luck. Daynia


 My mother , who is now deceased, first showed signs of Alzheimers in late 1995. In 1996 my dad passed away and it became clear she needed help. The hospital in a larger city about 25 miles from her town operates a monitoring service for patients like her. She had a monitor on a necklace which she could push if she got into trouble. Also there was a monitor in her house and they checked on her everyday. Later in 1997 I saw a drawback to having a monitor on you if you are an Alzheimer's patient. You forget what it's for. But, it still gave me a greater sense of security knowing this was in her house and on her person.


 I too do research studies that are involved with Alzheimer's. Although I do not know anyone currently affected by this disease, I do believe such a device would be very helpful for both the patient and their family members.


 Hi Novo I think you have a great idea. My father passed away, but he had alzheimers and he had a terrible accident when he was alone. He tripped and fell in the bathtub, broke his nose, and was terribly bruised. My mother got home to find him in the tub and he couldn't get out. That is the last time he was ever left alone. It is a horrible and very sad illness. Any idea that would give family members a more secure feeling would be a great relief even though it is very sad to watch. The Best of Luck to you and your idea. You can benefit a lot of people and they will appreciate it more than you will ever know. I know this first hand and from a long time of experience. It is great to know people who care. Thank you !!!!"
Am I seeing the start of Alzheimer's in my aunt?,"She is 84, no physical in over 40 years and no Dr. contact since she retired as a receptionist/clerical in a medical practice. She will not, and I mean not, go to a Dr. I've worked quietly with an elderly coalition who checks on her and offers her services, mentioned concerns, etc. About a month ago now I found out that she fell and it took her about 3 hours, per her, to get to the phone. She did not call me for help nor 911 but called a friend who told her to call a neighbor, who got the apt. manager, whose daughter is an RN, and they got her up and thought she was ""fine"" but she wasn't sure about what day it was, etc. Now I know she also has a drinking problem. My two cousins and I are the relatives she has. The female cousin out west has been on SSDI for mental illness for years, is bipolar, and has a history of hospitalization and suicide attempts. My male cousin lives here--he isn't job hunting yet (2 years) but is all over the country at auto races. She is not his priority. This leaves me--and I have fought my second recurrence of ovarian cancer since 8/03 and now the chemo has failed and we are in MAJOR decision time (as in should I quit, etc.) Today I went to take her some gift certificates for the grocery a woman takes her to and some newspaper sections. The day of the fall, her dinner burned on the stove as it boiled dry. Today she checked when I came and she had nearly waterless macaroni. She rationalized away what looks to be an infected eye as ""well, this looks like something the man upstairs had, and they had to take it off, and it was nothing. After that I've been more sensitive about my eyes and I scratched it cleaning the mucous out."" Not when it's read around the eyelid and underneath. As I say--""doctor"" is a forbidden word. I've given her materials to get her equal care from two local HMO's to save money--but she has decided not to bother with that as she ""lives today and not in the future"" and part of her financial squeeze (I pay her gas and electric bill and the food certificates; the others contribute from time to time) is due to a $585 quarterly policy that is overpriced and she'd have good care at either HMO one at $290 a quarter or HMO2 at $411 a quarter. Today we were discussing the shopping trips and she said, ""I keep the gift certificates in my purse along with my wallet so if Dee calls during the night I am ready to go shopping."" Dee has a rigid schedule, every other Friday, pickup at such and such a time... This makes no sense. I am wondering what I am seeing here, I see her maybe weekly. Does this sound more like mini-strokes and alcohol effects or may I be starting to see the onset of Alzheimer's or something similar.","Do you have POA on her???


 Hi Margaret. I am by no means an expert,but i think if it was me in your situation i would be firm but fair with your aunt,and tell her that all though you want to continue to help her in anyway that you can,this MUST include taking her to see a doctor.She sounds stubbon and i realise that it will be difficult to persuade her,so you could be honest with her about your own health problems,and explain that if you don't have the advice and backup of a doctor in the care of your aunt then it may come to a stage where you will nolonger be able to visit her.She will probably respond with ""but i can't manage without you""Then you can say,""well you know what must be done then"" I know it sounds harsh and easier said than done,but somtimes these things just have to be done.Your own health is also at stake here and you realy need to have some back up where your aunt is concerned. I hope things work out well for you. Sue"
I'm New Here,"My Mom has had Ad for 5 yeras now. She hurt her back in Sep 2002, ""Compression fracture"". She lives in her own her but since she her hurt back we called in renifrocements and started in home care givers to help. In December we started care 24 hrs. a day. Dr said we needed to put her in a nursing home or have more care. I have been her main care giver, along with the support and help of my husband and 2 sons for the past 5 yrs. Now her bones are like chalk and her mind has really gone downhill, However her back is better and is eating a lot better. My Mom is 71 yrs. old and was finally clinically diagniosed wtih vascular dementa in December. She has classic Sun Down sydrome, she seems to be very busy in the evenings and calls when I'm not there. We recently started Celexa for her depression, and is also on Zyprexa for her delusions, hostily and in general agitation. Latest Battle, should not drive a car! We are slowing working through the driving issue. Everyday is a challage Just wanted to say Hi I'm glad I found this place, Was losing my mind, Its the size of a peanut and soon it will be the size of a pea!! God bless,"" tc all""","Hi Zubz. Thanks for you kind words. Sounds like you have had some very emotional years. I'm sorry to hear about the lose of your mother. And now the struggle with your Father. This is such a difficult and ugly disease to understand. The gulit issue is still rumbles in my heart, but I know I'm at my mothers home as much as time will allow. I feel very fortunate to have a wonderful group of care givers, in fact I went to high school with one of them, Small World? I'll take your advise about taking a break when ever and where every I can, Promise me you do the same Peace and Hope You just helped my peanut size brain, grow a little larger Bless You Take Care, .....Peanut...


 Oh Moonstruck I’m so sorry to hear about your mother and now your wife. However you have been giving a beautiful gift. The precious gift love that has grown stronger over the years. This disease tears all of apart. I’m grateful you searched for support, for without friendship and support we would be lost. I wish you peace and hope for the days to come Take Care Moonstruck you are a rare gem Fondly Peanut


 My father was diagnosed in Feb 2000. We lost my mom in June 2000. We convinced him to live in an assisted living where he stayed till July of 2002, except from Jan 2002 till July we had to have 24/7 sitters with him to keep him in this place. Moved him to a different assisted living that has a dementia wing in July 02. It's been a good move, but he's going down. My father was a very independent person, a brilliant businessman and a treasure to his family. It has been damn hard seeing him lose all this identity, but I imagine it has been much harder for him than I. He was very angry when I took away his driving privileges, very agtitated on a continual basis, paranoid too. Being around him from the time my mom died till this past July was a bittersweet mix of love and hate, resentment and depression. It's hard on everyone, I'll tell you that. Don't let it get you too down though, a lot of people are going through this in varying degrees. it's like a rite of passage for the children of the AD parent. My father is still with us, sometimes, and I cherish every moment or word or touch I have from him like it's my last. I wish he could be his old self, I really miss that. One thing though, have some time for yourself and don't let anyone shame you for having it. regards Zubz


 Hello there, peanuts and zubz: I can empathize with what your are going through with your parents. My mother, although not suffering from alzheimer's developed similar symptoms. Hers were also associated with vascular and oxygen deprivation issues. My wife and me were there for her, although the weight of the care and supervision fell on my sister's shoulders, God bless her. Today Sunday March 16th, is the fifth anniversary of my mother's passing away. But I am writing because of my dear wife. I take my handle (moonstruck) from the fact that on the same occassion when my wife failed her mental test with her neurologist, confirming a dementia diagnosis by the neuropsychologist (soon to be two years ago), the last question asked by the doctor was: Will you write here a sentence for me? I was looking at her with a mixture of anguish and tenderness watching her fail the questions asked from her, seeing in a structured setting the evidence of her diminished mental capacity, once so vibrant and brilliant! And she wrote her sentence and the doctor said: Very good! (He did not share the sentence with me nor did I ask right then and there, maintaining a respectfull distance). When we went over to pay the medical deductible, her file was open to the page with her answer, and I gently moved it so that I could read what she had written, and there it was: ""The moon will come out tonight at 7:00 PM!"" I loved her more than ever at that very moment. We had used the moon so many times in a romantic moment or had used it to bring us together at times when we had been temporarily separated. I have been trying to salvage a much as possible for these last two years of what has been a true love story, before and during the 29 years we have been married - we will celebrate our 29th anniversary on june 27th - and we have faced during the Holidays, begining last December 16th the most serious crisis we have lived through, when she lost control and her hostility was unmanageable and we had to hospitalize her. She had been completely mobile and independent still and the hospitalization, when it ended in January 28th had left her in a wheelchair. She is still fighting to get back her ability to sit in bed by herself, to stand and walk for herself. Her follow up visit with the neurologist and with the expert in physical therapy were positive, she may be able to walk again, but it is going to be an uphill battle. I decided sometime ago to write alzheimer's without a capital A; I refuse to do her work and she will take my wife away from me inch by inch, millimiter by millimeter...I have a very limited system of support and our daughters have broken my heart at the insensible way they have decided to take to face this tragic illness...I feel abandoned with my ailing wife...and angry. I have been caring for my wife this weekend, alone with her, and although her daughters live a mere 5 minutes away they do not visit nor do they even call to ask how she's doing or to ask if I need to go out (which I did and could not go out neither yesterday or today Sunday). It was upon feeling this anger that I began searching for a support group forum and walked into this site. Thanks for hearing me out.


 So Sorry Moonstruck! I'm living with Alzheimer's,not dying from it.At least for now.I ffel bad for you,enjoy her for as long as you can.Take her out often,let her get sun,& see the world even though she may not remember.That's what I old my hubby to do for me when I no longer know what's going on.I don't want to stagnate by being inside all the time. I have a very positive attitude maybe this has helped me.Maybe I'm still doing so well as God has a plan for me to help others to understand,who knows?"
Support Groups for caregivers,"Do any of y'all go to support groups? Do you find it to be beneficial? I keep reading about how it's a good idea for the caregivers to go, but I'm having a difficult time finding one in my area.","Hi Pixie - Great Topic! I hope some others post here. I haven't gone either. Because I measure the use of my time (and limited energy - I am from the Lupus forum). I would love to know how helpful these groups are, as I would visit w/dad while Mom goes to the meetings. Thanks for the great idea!!!! If you've been a support meeting - please post and let us know what helpful things you have learned. Hello SnowyLynn - how are you doing these days? Blessings!


 I spent some time looking for support groups yesterday, but it seemed like most of the ones that I was finding are for people with Alzheimer's, not the caregivers. But I found a hotline that says it will find a support group that best fits your needs (I don't have the number with me now, but if anyone wants it let me know).


 I found a bunch that lists their type as peer groups. I'm going to Silverado with Nana on Friday. I'll ask them about support groups then. Post Edited (PixieDustStorm) : 2/3/2005 10:19:07 AM (GMT-7)


 It depends on where you live.Call the Alzheimer's Association chapter in your area.


 Most caregiver support groups are good,it just depends on how the fasillitator handles things.


 Hmm,Didn't realise there were so many for the ones with AD.I'm near Wichita Falls & there are none here for the affecteds.just a couple for caregivers.


 Pixie: I found the following website which will locate your nearest Alzheimers Chapter - includes telephone numbers, address, etc.: http://www.alz.org/findchapter.asp Blessings!"
Alzheimer's Disease...cost of medication,"Greetings from Lubbock,Texas. This is my first post and I really don't know where to start. My Mother is in the first stage of Alzheimer's disease. My Dad is her primary caregiver and he recently had to put her in a locked facility because of her aggression, hostility, and the fact that she has started wondering away from their home. The cost is really more than he can afford and then yesterday he got a bill for $900.00 (fifteen days of medicine). There is no way he can afford this expense. How do you cope with the expense???? He is not a wealthy man and worries that he won't be able to handle the expense. He is 75 and my Mom is 74. He is not in good health, having had two heart bypass surgeries and a pacemaker. I would appreciate any suggestions that any of you might have.","Hi, we live in Canada and my father-in-law who shared our home has Alzheimer's. He also happens to be a veteran and all his medication, extra home-care support, wheel-chairs, etc. are all covered by the vets affairs. Were lucky, because the pills for Alzheimer's alone cost about 5$ a day, and they help him a lot. Unfortuneately, the stress of looking after him has takin a toll on the family. My kids are afraid of him sometimes, as he is starting to become demanding and aggressive.


 Hi from Texas. Does your Dad own his own home? If so they would expect him to sell it to give the money to the nursing home. Also your MOM should be getting SS. If so then they usually take all but $50.00. Meds should be covered by medicare/medicaid. Does he or she have a social worjer? If not call human services or even a lawyer if you muct to get all of this fixed. No was should he be paying that. I hope somone else also answers this. I can only go by what they did with my MIL. She didn't own anything, but my SIL surely was capable of paying the nursing home bill. But she didn't have to pay a dime for care or meds. Please look into this as soon as possible. I wouldn't go too much by the hospital social worker if you have seen her already and this is the result. If not then give her a try. Jope this is a lead in the right direction and please let me know. Daynia


 Sassy,sounds like he needs a medication change........oops,I meant Jeannie."
driving,"Hi, Am new here, but have a question.Hubby age 85How do I keep him from driving.Only makes the 2 mile trip occasssionally-has beedn doing so for 2 years.No problems yet, but aware there can be.","What we did with my mother in law to stop her driving, was to disconect the battery and we told her there was a problem with the car.(well we wern't lying,it wouldn't start!) We are finding this illness hard to deal with as a family even though ther is lots of help out there.Especialy as my sister has also been recently diognosed with early dementia at 53. Bag Lady


 My grandmother hides the keys from my grandfather. She also has to lock the door with the key and hide them because my grandfather will wander off in the night. He thinks she's trying to kill him, so he tries to escape. I don't know if he's asked to drive or not, but I know for sure she wouldn't let him!


 Hi, do you drive? If so, you should take over the task. If not, consider the risks of him getting into an accident or causing one. How would you feel if he killed someone and you didn't do anything to prevent it. Or how would he feel? I know this because...my father in law has alzheimer's and we had to ask him that same question a couple yrs ago. He was a bad driver and did not realize it. We live in Canada and maybe laws are different, but we simply called the motor vehicle branch and they sent him a letter saying he needed a medical, eye and road test done. If he passed, he could continue, if not his licence was removed. He just decided to turn in his licence. We soon sold his car as it was a sad reminder for him. Now he is fine. Too bad the disease is a lot worse though. Almost time for a home. Good luck...Sassy


 If he can't get the keys,he can't drive,then just tell him,if he still understands,or get the Dr. to do it,or contact the DMV as them to retest him & pray he won't pass.............."
Lost???,"Lost: Grampa's cane and now hat, for the 5th time this week. How long does this stage last? Its already been a yr or so but getting worse. Good news, the cane is in his hand. Please don't take offence people....its just a little early morning humour. Have a good day all!","I visited my grandpa this weekend and I went out to get the mail and when I came back in, he said, ""I saw that boy out there you were trying to lasso with that intertube."" I tried to tell him there was no boy and no intertube, but he was convinced. Oh well. Other than that, he was pretty normal.


 Oh, he was definitely laughing. I didn't want to go along with it because I felt like I would be making fun of him. But I did make light of it. I couldn't convince him otherwise, so I just smiled and laughed with him.


 Hey! Good humor means a good attitude........... My memory gets loster & worser at times too....lol


 Tell him ""yes sir"".Make light of it or get him to laughing over it.Use your imagination..........Lynne"
hi- i'm new here,hi guys.. im new over here.. im really in the d.i.d. board but i came over to say hi.. and share my story with you.. my mom just died at 72.. she had dementia.. actually she must have had it 30 years... my therapist says she might have had alcohol induced dementia..she drank 2-3 drinks a day everyday forever.. not enough to get drunk.. but i believe she pickled her brain... i am very sad about her passing but what scared me more was her living 20 more years with this dementia.. she was getting so childlike and difficult... her driving got bad.. some wrecks.. we took her keys away.. boy was she angry and called us every name in the book.. she often didnt even know where she was or that someone just left the room 5 minutes ago.. she was in complete denial about her dying.. i do believe it was a blessing in disguise she died.. life didnt have good things in store for her.. best wishes to all of you.. has anyone else out there have a similer story?,"What do you mean life didnt have good things in store for her? She had you didn't she? ;o) I work in a nursing home and see suffering everyday, it's not death that bothers me, it's the suffering. I am a CNA (oh God the dreaded CNA....LOL) Sometimes we see things that are indescribable, hopefully your mother died peacefully. 72 is not that old. I lost my mother 15 years ago at the ripe old age of 61, and she suffered terribly from cancer. I hope your mother did not fare so badly in the ""transition"". God Bless You"
Any suggestions?,"Hi, everyone: My mom (95) is getting worse with the alzheimers disease these past 3 months. She is now in a phase where she talks and talks continually (not making any sense), for hours, mostly 6 to 8 hours straight non-stop. Day or night it doesn't matter, as she has no perception of time. My sister looks after her full time, and her nerves are shot listening to it. We are also concerned for our Mom's health, as she is exhausted after all that talking. A lot of the talking includes crying and begging sounds, and sounds like a wounded animal. It is really depressing seeing our mother like this. Is there anything we can do for Mom, some kind of medication or something to calm her down? Any suggestions to deal with this? For-get-me-not","Hi, Paul: Thanks for your reply. I really appreciated hearing from someone regarding this alzheimer's problem. Yes, our mother has a good doctor. He only looks after the elderly, and is quite experienced. We will definately ask him about those anti-depressants you mentioned, when she goes in for her next check-up. The Alzheimer's Society nurse that comes once per week to visit mom and my sister, said to give mom ""gravol"", as the side effect from the medication will calm her down. I wasn't too impressed with this suggestion, and was worried about it interfering with mom's heart failure condition, etc. We stilll take our mother out with us for "" lunch out"" once a week, and she seems to enjoy it. She even has a few moments of wisdom, once in a while, when she remembers who we are, etc. Hope to hear from you again, Paul. Sincerely, Lorna. (Forget-me-not)


 I've just a quick moment having just read your post. My name is Paul, I posted just before yours about stopping the Aricept. Since we have discontinued it over two months ago, we've seen the rapid decline we knew would come. It seems we all have a goal in mind, after mom asked us numerous times if there was anything we could do to give her peace, to give it to her became our goal. She'd been on the medication for nearly 6 yrs. We decided it was time to let her go, and she has been less agitated recently as a result. So we think we've accomplished what we'd set out to do. But as you know, our expectations always have to change with Alzheier's disease. So at any time, the agitation may return. A day at a time, yes? Now for your goal. Be specific about it with her doctor. Does your mom have a physician that is used to working with the elderly, specifically Alzheimer's patients? Her constant speaking could be a result of agitation? My mom is taking and tolerating Celexa and Remeron for depression, maybe this would help yours? I'll be back later with links to a site where you can compare medications, and another excellent site that has quite a bit of activity. Paul"
Patients  here?,I have been wondering if there is anyone posting here who is an Alzheimer's patient themselves. I know that some patients have kept journals and even written books about their mental decline. I've also been wondering if it would be okay to post a poem I've written about Alzheimers. Hope I hear from some of you.,"I have Alzheimer's.


 Ozzie, Please post the poem you've written about Alzheimers. I'd like to read it. My grandmother had Alzheimers and died almost a year ago. I can't believe its been that long. She was such a wonderful person and I hated watching her deteriorate the way she did. I have Crohn's disease... and am normally on that board, but I was lurking around here reading the posts. Its too bad this board is not more active... I think a lot of people need support. Laura"
Grandfather,"Some of you may remember me coming on here and asking a few questions about my grandfather who was dx with Alzheimer's a few months ago. Well, he passed away last week. He fell and broke his hip and had a partial hip replacement 2 months ago. He had a hard time coming out of the anesthesia, developed pneumonia, then got a staph infection. Just when we thought he was getting well enough to come home (they already had the hospital bed in the house), he died. Thanks for the support I got here and I hope they find a cure soon. He's in a better place now.","Hi everyone just lending a little unsolicited experience. I am a CNA in a skilled nursing facility (the politically correct name for nursing home) and most of my patients are Alzheimers sufferers along with other forms of brain syndromes and organic disorders like dementia. Please accept my condolonces on your loss Stephanie, and yours too forget-me-not, for yours is a loss too. This disease is much harder on the family than it is on the sufferer, believe me. It never ceases to amaze me how little is known about this. Then again, it never ceases to amaze me how many dollars go toward studying how the Amazonian Green Frog mates. I would think that money (in the millions) would be put to good use, like more studies on the brain and its functions, or more importantly, its DYSFUNCTIONS. Maybe it could shed some light on Alzheimers, Dementia and even why some people turn into sociopathic killers. Anyway, Bless You All sandi


 Hi, Stephanie: I read your post today, and wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your Grandfather's passing. My Mom fell and broke her hip in April of 2002. My sister and her had arrived at my home for Easter dinner. Mom got out of the car and leaned against it, and in the split second that no one was looking she fell on the hard pavement of the driveway. She lost consciousness for about 5 minutes, and I ran in the house to call an ambulance. She is 94, and has alzheimers. Mom had surgery and a pin put in her hip, and she has never walked again since then. We were all worried she would get pnemonia, but she didn't. My sister and I have been through a lot with Mom, watching her mind deteriorate. Alzheimer's is a terrible disease. Any way, I just wanted to share my story with you, and want you to know you and your family are in my thoughts and prayers today. Sincerely, Lorna (Forget-me-not) P.S. I chose the screen name Forget-me-not, because it is the flower symbol for the Alzheimers Society here. It is sad and ironic because my Mom has forgotten me."
new Alzheimer's drug from Germany?,"Hi: I am trying to get information about a new drug from Germany to retard or hold off Alzheimer's. I read it in an article, but I misplaced it.

 Memantine has been out since last year.Have friends who have been on it over a year,they ordered it direct grom Germany.


 It's called Memantine.It works well in some,better in others,or not at all.Like all medications it depends on the person.It is expensive $150.00 for 30 days.It's supposed to be from the moderate stages on.

Hidden Talent,"Since Monday is Valentine's Day, I took Nana to a place called Hidden Talent. They have ceramics and you can paint them. She picked out a heart, painted it red, and gave it to Papa. It now hangs on the wall over their bed. It took some convincing to get her to paint it herself, but she did a great job. Papa gave her a teddy bear that sings a love song.","Very interesting Pixie!! Dad did a whole lot of ceramics before he declined. He had ben dx and on meds . . .but was still pretty independant. He made a doll for each daughter and granddaughter (10 in all) which he used real lace and layered it for the dress and painted over it. And he made many other pieces too . . eagle, lighthouse, bear, castle, santa, etc. He seemed to really enjoy it. I asked him why he doesn't do that anymore and he claims that the lady who oversees the ceramic room at the senior center ran him off. I think I will pretend to be a senior (I am 51) and take him over there! But today, we worked on a Jr. jigsaw puzzle and had a lot of fun. It is really strange though . . . he knows exactly how I am feeling . . . he knows when I hurt, he knows when I am tired, etc. . . . even when I can fool my mom and family. I think that is very touching. He has also asked for me by name during the week . . . and he hasn't done any names for quite a while. . . so I am touched. Thanks for sharing Pixie. . . we still plan to do that pedicure . . . couldn't find an open shop on a Monday . . LOL. Snow, thanks again for the jigsaw idea!!!!


 Aww,that's so sweet.


 Hello Pixie, Snowy, LKE Lyn, and others: Dad and I had a really good time today. He was eager to do our jigsaw puzzle and he worked very hard on it. He was joking and laughing and very proud of his work. He spread the glue over it himself this time (he taped one all together and so we started pouring glue over top and spreading it out with a platic spatula .. . works great). He reasures me that it will dry clear and checks on it repeatedly. We went shoping and bought two more puzzles (we are doing the 100 piece puzzles). He didn't want the puzzle with the bears as he was afraid they would 'get lose in the the house'. He is so deer!!!! He took me on a tour of his house (I lived there a number of years when I was young . . . but he doesn't remember that) and showed me all the ceramics that he had done. He showed me his racing pictures (he used to race a stock car!) and we talked about his racing days. It was a lovely day!! Blessings!"
need advice,"Hey there....I was here in 2001 and you people really helped me with my mom and her Alzhiemer's.....now I need your help again....my boss's dad has Alzhiemer's and is in Arizona...anyone familiar with that state? I'm in Washington State and I'm sure they have different laws down there....what I would like to know is how to get help for my boss in getting her dad to get admitted to an Alzhiemer's Home....evidentaly S. registered her dad with a Home, S. has the power-of-attorney, but until he says ""yes"" S. can't get him admitted. In fact, she can't even get him out of the car if they go somewhere, except back to his place. As we all know, denial is a HUGE part of the begining stages of the big A....she finally got the van disabled so he can't drive, but S. works up in the North here, her dad won't move in with her (she brought him up here to stay for a while and THAT was a huge disaster).....she's been down there since the 10th of Dec. trying to talk her dad into going into this wonderful place that has a golf course and all, and he won't go. She even arranged for Meals-on-wheels and he left the house after they called to say they'd be there. Any ideas? Suggestions? Anything would be welcomed.","The Dr. has diagnosed her dad with Alzhiemer's....but as I've learned from experience with my mother's situation, that's as far as a Dr. is will to go in Washington..when we took mom back to her Dr. to have her tell mom that she would need help with her condition the Dr. changed her evaluation from a level 4 to a level 2 rather than tell mom she needed help...which made mom think she was getting better.....that's why I'm asking about Arizona.....do the Dr.s in Arizona have more ""power"" in helping place an elder, rather than having to go thru the courts and have him declared incompetent?


 Please contact the Alzheimer's Association. You can't count on the Dr.'s. for everything. Here in Florida I have come to rely heavily on the Alzheimer's Association. They are a wealth of knowledge.


 Where is the Dr.in all this??


 Het her to a Neurologist.Primary care Drs don't know that much about AD(Alzheimer's).


 Here is a board that's in Fla. Alzonline.net"
I'm new here,"I also have Alzheimer's disease.Now, do run & hide from me,I won't bite.lol I'm here to help,& maybe learn too,as I still can. I help others on different boards,chats& am accepted 100% everywhere I go.If you have questions,don't be bashful,just ask. I was also a Certified Nursing Assistant for over 30 years,so I know both sides basically.If I can't answer a question I will tell you. AD is nothing to mince words about in my book.","My AD was caught very early(MCI),in 1998.I was 58,but would have been DX at 56 if I had gone back to the Neuro after the 1st.MRI. I still drive,don't get lost,still enjoy a full life,or most of it.I'm now 63,soon to be 64.My motivation is not good,noises bother me greatly,I rarely get hungry,but if we go out I can see what I want then I eat better.I don't cook anymore,afraid I'll leave the burners on(gas.) I'm very aware of everything that goes on with me,but when stressed I don't know flip.lol.I saw my MRI(2) Atrophy is more pronounced in my second one.The Plaque & tangles are not quite in the middle of my brain,just one spot,so feel fortunate at that. I'm on the internet most of the day,helping others on boards,or chats,at least I try. Most people think when we get AD we deteriate at an accelerated speed,some do,some don't.There are different forms of dementias,& about 50 or more diseases that cause dementia. I have several friends with AD who have written books. Someone To Show Me the Way to go Home ""Larry's Way"" both written by Larry Rose ""Love Me,My Life Turned Upside Down by Alzheimer's"" written by Jeaane L.Lee.Both at Barnes&Noble. Some people still don't believe I have AD,but that's their problem,Wish I didn't but I refuse to cry over spilt milk. I've never been in denial,I'm facing this with a positive attitude.


 LOL,I forget words too,but I laugh & go on.No,I'm very aware of everything,including any changes in me.When I do,I talk with my Dr.


 Chris,Alazheimer's is not a mental illness.It's a Degenerative disease. Medicare approved testing for Dementias,also rehab with physical problems of the ones with AD..........


 You didn't offend me Chris..But there are people who think It's a mental disease.You're right We didn't cause this,we can't fix it!We learn to live with what we've been dealt with,& go on.............


 I understand Crohn's.I took care of a man with it.It's rough to say the least.I never allow negative people in my life,they don't understand,refuse to learn,so out they go.The stress is too much for me to handle since STRESS is the worst for anyone with AD.Arguing,pushing,yelling this type thing can cause the person to be worse at that particular time.I ususally clam up,go watch tv or read,just be alone,then after wahile I'm fine again....


 No,of course you're not a bad person! Does your husband help with his care?When I first started out working it used to embarrass me terribly to clean up a man,but i got used to it,it just takes time,but it needs to be done so the skin doesn't break down,& then sores start..........


 I love to chat,though it tires me out more some days than others. I use the MSN IM ,also AIM IM. I have many friends on both. I'm on the pc from am to pm & in between.lol I'm in several chats have a blast in them........


 SnowyLynne, You are definitely the coolest! I'm 62, and fear A.D. greatly. I have some symptoms, but maybe they are from some medications I take for bipolar disorder. And btw, I hope people won't run away from **me,** either. I'm in good shape now! I'm real balanced and won't bite, any more than SnowyLynne does! One of my meds causes a slight aphasia which causes me to forget names of things, and other words. And one or more of them causes me to be forgetful in general; but although I had an excellent memory till after high school, my personal view is that the extreme rigor of the college I went to, somehow messed up my brain and ruined my natural memory. I have a great interest in memory anyway, being an Educator. And also a musician. Ear playing, improvising and jamming are things that early ""classical"" training can really ruin if the teacher doesn't know what s/he is doing. This is what happened to me, so I lost my sense of rhythm, ear, and ability to improvise. I got it all back, and learned to jam, too, after age 30. All this took great physical, psychological and emotional effort. It's a long story that is sorta irrevalent so I won't go any further with it here. Anyway, I think you get the picture that I'm real aware of how I think and see things, and I'm not happy about the way things are going for me now, memory wise. And I must also add that my dad had Alzheimer's. He died of cancer. His sister has had Alzheimers for too many years to count. She remains in a care home in Canada where she is totally helpless. These two situations frighten my two siblings and myself, and we ""look around every corner"" or our minds to see if we are getting A.D. ElderBerry


 Welcome to the board. I've got a question for you. How you stay coherent enough to remember to check to boards? I'm not making fun. My grandfather was recently diagnosed with AD and he can't even dress himself. He knows who people are most of the time, but he also sees imaginary people all the time. Sometimes he thinks he and my grandmother are divorced (they've been married for 59 years). I know he definitely would not be able to even figure out how to turn a computer on.


 Dear Lynne, thanks so much for joining us. Your so young to have AD. I'm not a nurse, but clean in a home for intermediate care. I also had a Grandma with AD and live with my father-in-law (85) with AD. I forgot how young this disease can effect people. Do you know your life expectancy? Don't mean to sound rude, just curious. My father-in-law is taking Exelon. This had made a huge improvement and delayed the progress for 2 yrs almost. I wonder what really goes on in his mind sometimes. When he can't remember the words for almost everything, it makes him angry and he said yesterday he would just like to die. Do you really get to a point where you are unaware of almost everything? Or are just unable to use your motor skills????? That's another disease I think. Welcome again... now I have to research colon polyps. I have Ulcerative Colitis and just this morning my GI found 3 polyps and will send them for biopsy. Just another thing to worry about! Bye for now....Sassy


 Sassy-good luck on the polyps! I haven't made it to the UC board yet today. My grandfather was just dx (diagnosed) 2-3 months ago. I went to visit him a couple weeks ago (he lives 6 hours away) and he was so out of it. He didn't talk much at all, but when he did, it didn't make any sense. He was convinced that there were men in the house installing wires under the carpet and kept telling me not to trip over them. He even tried to pull them up. There was nothing there. It was a little strange for me (I'm 23). He turned 80 this year, but I think he's had a problem for a while. Forgetting things, getting in the tub with his clothes on, wetting the bed, etc. They thought it was just dementia, but found out it's AD. Once in a while, he'll have a moment of clarity and start crying. It's really sad. I'm not trying to get you down. I'm sure you've seen what it can do. But honestly, if I start losing my mind, I want someone to put me out of my misery. I would rather have a physical condition (which I do - Crohn's) than a mental one.


 I didn't mean to offend. I know it's a physical disease of the brain. But it affects people mentally. They can't remember stuff and they see things that aren't there. At least that's what it's doing to my grandfather. It's not mental like multiple personalities or schizophrenia. I didn't mean that. I just couldn't stand knowing that I was doing things that normally would embarass me (like seeing people that aren't really there). That being said, I don't blame anyone for it. I know you did nothing to get this disease, just as I did nothing to get Crohn's. You didn't ask for it and you can't do anything about it. I was just saying that you are very brave for dealing with it so well. I'm sorry if it came out the wrong way.


 Easier said than done, huh? The going on part. I've found that difficult with my disease. I can't seem to just go on with life when I have something that affects me every day, you know? By the way, I'm Steph. I get that all the time, though. I need to change our name to stephnchris. 1022 is our wedding anniversary (October 22).


 Lynne, I feel guilty. Maybe you can help. I think because its my father-in-law that has AD and he lives in a basement suite in our home and I have to do most of the added care, I get angry sometimes. Ya I know its not his fault. But it gets a bit much sometimes. I feel uncomfortable about his personal care. I had to cut his nose and ear hair last week. I have to wash out his dirty underware sometimes and listen to him complain about all his meals ( half of which I make ). Maybe if it were my own MoM or Dad it would be different. A couple yrs ago he felt he was a burden on us. Now he's past that stage and after spending 2 weeks in respite care in a home that we wish him to end up living in, he complained the whole time and kept re-peating he never wants to live there. Go figure, 2 yrs ago he would have gladly moved in. Its different at work. I love working in the special care unit. It's not a problem for me to chat and bond with them. But I don't have to stay with them, or feed them etc. I guess I'm feeling guilty that I can't seem to bond as good with him now. Like I almost resent that our lives are stuck here looking after him. Am I a bad person? Sassy


 Thanks Lynne, I guess the stress of everything else in my life, work, kids, and grampa all contributed to a bad flare of UC. 1 yr ago I passed a kidneystone and continued to get sicker until I was finally dx in April with UC. All that stress, I know, played a part in the onset of this bad flare-up. On my very worst days when I spent most of the time in the bathroom, Dad would always need something. This made things worse for me. But I'm taking celexa now and that seems to help my anxiety. Enough of me, and my problems. Are you a computer junkie? I just happen to have days off during the week and find myself on these boards checking up on my fellow UC friends. Now and then I would read this board. Glad I did. I don't even know how to use a chat room. Maybe one day I'll try it. Take care....Sassy


 Sassy where are you?????


 Elderberry,Don't fear Alzheimer's,face it head on,get on medications ASAP when you are diagnosed.Get you will,& POA in order while you still can.That's what I did.Now,I'm living again................."
Where's everyone at?,Hardly anyone posts much.Hope all is well with everyone.,"I'm here everyday,checking,several times a day in fact.


 Sounds like a great idea Pixie. Yes . . . Dad took the first 'taped' puzzle and stood it up on the buffet in the dining room. The second puzzle is drying. Mom said ""what will we do with all these puzzles . . . we should put them back in the box and reuse them"". I told mom it is good for dad to have the puzzles displayed and it gives him somethig to show people and talk about when he has company. I think it really perks him up!!


 I'd have never thought about doing a puzzle with Nana; we're not a puzzle family (we've all got short attention spans for projects), but now I really want to make one. I may just go to Wally World tonight and pick one up tonight. Do you use a special glue or is any clear kind ok? I think I may stop by a craft store, too, and pick up some stuff to make pins. Nana loves pins, so maybe I can get her to help me make some. I have a question.... in psychology the other week, this guy said that his dad works in diagnosing Alzheimer's. He said that his patients couldn't fill in the numbers of a clock. They'd get the first couple numbers, but then just start scribbling. Have you ever heard of this?


 I still do many things.I'm not out of it yet.lol.I still drive to the Dr. & to town to see hubby at the rehab hosp.He had a total knee replacement last week,& in rehab.'til Fri.Then I will be doing all the driving for awhile,'til the Dr.says he can drive again.Then when this knee is well,he'll have the other knee done,as it's not in any better shape than the one that was just worked on.


 Snowy . . . you are really doing great . . . I love it. I hope hubby heals fast so he can have the other knee done! People that have that done say it was the best thing they've ever done for themselves. You go girl!!!


 Hi SnowyLynne . . . It isss quiet here in AD. Glad to see your post . . . was wondering how you were. Its been just you me and Pixie for the most part. Dad and I did another jigsaw puzzle yesterday. (He taped the last one together) He was so concerned about the puzzle that we finally decided to glue it together. We spread clear drying craft glue over the top and it came out really nice. He is so proud of it and can't wait to show everyone. Thanks again for the great idea!


 Are you going to frame the puzzle and hang it up somewhere? Now I want to get a giant puzzle, put it all together, and decopodge it onto my coffee table.


 I agree.I never enjoyed doing puzzles,only the ones I can do online every day.


 I bet SnowLynn could do the clock face . . . depends on how far advanced the patient is. Dad is very good at directions. He can't tell you the name of the streets . . .but he can sure find his way around when I am driving. But he doesn't remember people at all. He doesn't know his own children. I think each person hangs on to some things that are important to them. Start with a small puzzle so it can be completed. I just used a craft glue (I think it was called craft glue) looks like Elmer's glu-all. Went on white and turned clear. We still need to see how well it will hold. Do let us know how Nanna likes the puzzles and the jewelry making. I got my puzzles at the dollar store. Blessings!


 Nana knows people if they're around and in sight. I was reading today, sitting across the room from her, and she kept asking where I was. She was reading a book my other grandmother wrote, and kept asking Papa who she was and how she knew her, which kept bringing the conversation back to me. But certain people she can just remember everything about them. Like my cousin, who she hasn't seen in over 3 years. I got distracted by IHOP on my way to the store tonight, but tomorrow I'll try and get there. Or maybe I'll go Friday so Nana can come and pick out her own puzzle. Snowy - How's your husband's rehab coming along?"
I need help,"Hello, My name is Laura and I am new around here. I have been working with ALzheimer patients for over 5 years at a hospital (short term facility) Now, my dream came true, and I am a Program Manager in an Alzheimer's Day care. I need some help, because I want to improve my program, and I can't find material on the net about activities and ideas for them. I will really appreciate if somebody can help me. On the other hand, even I am not a doctor (I am a paramedic) I know about meds, and treatements, I'll be glad to help as much as I can.","Thanks so much. I do that, but some of my patients in the day care are just in the first stage. I need something like groups, crafts and that kind of stuff.


 Being mentally cjallenged & having Alzheimer's are not the same thing. Many who go to daycare think they are going to work,or helping others .You mention daycare,& they many times will refuse to go,daycare to them is for kids.If you don't believe me,join a board,sit back & listen.


 Most people who have AD cannot learn,or understand,esp.when the daycare question is raised.In the case of EOAD the person does not need daycare,by the time the poor caregiver is ready the person is sundowning,attatched at the hip(so to speak)to his/her caregiver. In the 70's or 80's a person is already exhibiting many signs of AD,goes into denial,refuses help,daycare or anything else.It's not as easy as you perceive it to be...


 Laura and friends, I forgot one. My brother made a colage of pictures from my dad's race days. He just took an 81/2 x 11 frame and laid one picture next to and over the next one and fit in all the snap shots he could find. Dad has showed me that picture 18 times already. I always say, ""Yes I saw this - but who is that handsome race car driver"" and dad smiles and tells me a story. Then I ask him where he raced and we begin to recall each race track. . . you catchin on? It gives them something to do w/any visitor. It really has been a boost for him. He can't remember any of his family now, not the names of any of his 9 children or his grandchildren - my mom is ""that lady that boards here"" - but he does remember some of his past jobs and hobbies. He even went and shot pool with my brother yesterday. I was surprised. Please share what has helped your loved one.


 Snowy, where on-line did yo find them? do yo have a web-site? sounds fun.


 That's the one!!lol.


 Laly I too worked (as a Reg Nurse) with ad patients...but i have to say that Snowylynne is right here they take offence to the term daycare ..they are not children and they dont like to be treated as such.


 Folding clothes is a good one that many still enjoy,towels,wash cloths this type of thing.It depends on how far into the disease that are.


 Try card games like Solitary.Or tile game like Domino.


 I do know what I'm talking about.


 Hi Laura, I am new to the AD forum as well. You have the same question as me. It is hard to find appropriate activities. Dad and I made Christmas bells covering sections of egg trays in foil and then stringing them. He really enjoyed ""helping me"" make decorations for the family party. He also enjoyed clicking on a computer program where each click opens a new detail to the picture. I plan to find more of those. For Christmas, I took a picture of his cat and glued it on light weight cardboard, cut it out and boxed it. Made about three of these and he did put it together but think ""some bugger cut up a picture"". LOL Would love to hear what others do for fun and crafts. BTW, he didn't like hiking - ""the woods are really a mess and someone should clean them up"". All the branches and such lying about the ground really bothers him. Thanks Laura - great topic.


 Rosie,maybe he would enjoy jig saw online.I work puzzles sent to my e mail box every day...........


 Thanks Snowy!!! I just found some puzzles at jigszone.com GREAT idea.


 My mother is the same as your dad in away AR.she doesnt remember faces but she does remember and loves to cook .Of course I am with her when doing this"

 I USED THIS REPLY TO ASK YOU A QUESTION BECAUSE YOU MIGHT KNOW, DO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALZHEIMERS KNOW THEY HAVE IT? MY FATHER ISN'T ONE OF THEM BUT HE'S NOT A INVALID. HIS DEAMEANOR IS GREAT, HE'S ALWAYS SMILING AND LAUGHING, HE TAKES CARE OF HIMSELF, DOES HOUSEHOLD CHORES-WASHES THE DISHES, VACUUMES, ECT. HIS COMMUNICATIONS SKILLS ARE BAD BUT I THINK HE DOES CONCENTRATE WHEN ASKED A QUESTION. WHY I WANT TO KNOW IS THAT THE COURT ARBITRATOR HAS WRITTEN MY FATHER OFF AS USELESS. HE HASN'T DONE HIS HOMEWORK ON AZHEIMERS. I HAVE TO CONVINCE THIS GUY THAT MY FATHER WILL SUFFER ENORMOUSLY IF HE IS TAKEN OUT OF HIS HOUSE AND SEPARATED FROM ME WITHOUT SOME PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT. Thanks


 HE'S IN DENIAL. WHEN I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED TO MOVE TO FLORIDA WITH ME, HE REPLIED,""WHY SHOULD I MOVE, THIS IS MY HOUSE"". THERE IS NO WAY MY FATHER WILL LEAVE THIS HOUSE ON HIS OWN. HE'S LIVED HERE FOR 50 PLUS YEARS. iF HE WERE FORCED TO MOVE, IT WOULD UPSET HIM TO SICKNESS, I KNOW IT. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, I'VE CHANGED DOCTORS. HE IS IN THE CARE OF THE VETERENS ADMIN. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE PHYSC NEXT WEEK. WILL POST RESULTS-THANKS FOR THE INFO-GOD BLESS


 I'm doing great,can now get my arm up high enought to fix my hair in a pony tail.I just keep trying 'til I can do something...

 The pain pump came off this am,darned thing was banging/knocking everything off tables,,,,,,,,,,


 Saw my surgeon yesterday,he's pleased with my progress.I see him again in a month.Have therapies 'til Dec 3rd............


 I have a friend who also has Alzheimer's who cleans her home,keeps it picked,but still has maids come once a month to clean too. I have had Alzheimer's since 1996.I still drive myself to my therapy sessions 3 times a week.I don't cook,as I have left the gas burners on low,& forgotton about them,though hubby always would check. Not all people know they have AD,call it denial,or they are too far into the disease to know.I don't clean house,I don't care if it gets cleaned or not,that's called apathy.I have other health problems also that keep me from doing too much. I suggest the person to learn about AD as moving your Dad will most likely upset him,& can cause problems.Have you mentioned to your Dad about moving,& what is his reaction?? Does his Dr.have any say in all this that is going on?He should!


 MikeyB,I feel you did the right thing by changing Drs.for your Dad.I'll be praying for you..................


 Mikey B..........I really am happy that you changed docs as well for your Dads sake.Just because he has alzheimers does not make him useless.You are right as well as far as him not wanting to move as you posted he has lived in that house for 50 plus yrs and that would no doubt shake him up.Too many changes can make things worse for him(my opinion)I hope you get some answers and some peace of mind soon ...Take Care and God Bless you and your Dad


 My Dr.released me a month ago,I'm doing great."
Safety Equipment To Make Our Loved Ones Feel More Secure,"......Any Home Depot or hardware store will hav a section with some really good safety devices for our loved ones ...........Not to sure if States is the same as here but we can have the equipment covered by the Gov., For the tub they have the grip bars and chairs that will fit right onto the tub so person can sit and be bathed or showered..........and they are very easy to install..as well there is another type of grip bar you put on the side of tub so the person is able to feel more independent and help themselves get out of tub......so basically you have grips on each side of tub.......If your loved one is in a w/c and they have a tendency to get out and fall there is a table top that can fit onto the chair and will do up with velcro.This is not considered a restraint as long as your loved one is able with determination LOL to get it undone.Posy bars are really good as well and keeps Mom o Dad from falling out.One thing to keep in mind when they are in w/c is to have a good pillow for them to sit on and if in depends to keep them dry as possible to limit the decubiti ulcers that start so easy on the elderly and are so hard to contain and get rid of ..........If anyone else has suggestions please post.Hope all have a great Easter and the Easter Bunny is good to ya .....Take Care and God Bless",

WHAT WOULD YOU DO,"Hi Dave z here. My mother-in-law is 87 years old and has been in a alzheimer's nursing home for the past 5 years. She is presently in a phase where she thinks that she is at bording school. When my wife visits her, she refers to her as mom, not as her daughter. Yesterday my mother-in-laws remaining sister passed away. Our family now must make an informed decision as to weather or not to inform her of the passing of her sister. As to any family we seem to have a difference of opinion and have not as of yet made a final decision. Any thoughts on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.","Dave z.................I am truly sorry to hear of the difficulties you are facing.Does she even remotely remember her sister?Has the sister been visiting her at the home?I dont envy the position you are in but I personally would make a decision based on how much she remembers of her and how close they were.I know if it was me and had to do with my mom I would tell her whether she totally grasped what was being said. Sometimes my mom has better clarity on certain days than others and I would not want her to find out by someone other than the family........such as a good hearted nurse with all the best intentions........I think this is something you will have to feel out for yourselves and I wish you all the best .......you are in my thoughts and prayers as is your mother in law .God Bless


 Hi Snowy, LKE and Rosie for your very informative advice, greatly appreciated. Family cousins from out of town, whom we havent seen for years, visited mothe-in-law at the Alzeheimer's unit. She was plesant but did not recognize any of them. So we decided not to disturb the present state she is in and to leave well enough alone. Somewhat fearful of causing a state of agitation. We informed the nursing home staff of our decision. Hopefully we have made the right decision for her and also us. Thank you for your input, it was very helpful.


 Talk to her about her sister,feel her out about it without mentioning her death.If she thinks she's in a boarding school,She may not even know what death is,or understand.Might be best to not say anything.


 Hey Dave!!! You really make the rounds don't you!!! Sorry to hear about your troubles. I agree about telling m-i-l about her sister passing. . . Snow and Lyn made good point about feeling her out first. Dad thinks that his house is a boarding house. He takes his flashlight and goes upstairs a couple times a day to see if anyone is up there. When my brother visits from out of town, Dad reminds him not to leave his room too long or others will take his place. Dad also intorduces me as his mother. I don't think that he thinks I'm his mother, but he can't get the daughter word to come out and mother is close enough to suit him. You are a good man to visit with her. How has your daughter been doing? Any news from the doc yet? Blessings!"
Namenda,I started my first day of Namenda this morning.Time will tell how things go.,"Snowy, I hope it works wonders for you sis!! Dad has been taking it for almost a year. I think they waited too long to start using it. I hope you'll keep us posted! Blessings!

I bet he had a blast doing the painting of his car ,he is so lucky to have you and vice versa ........no hun my family dont give a rat's behind on how Mom is or help out in anyway except for this last little while (since the drinking) as I made my sister come back here to Moms and look after her ..........I check in and as hard as it is I will not do anything until Mom has stopped the drinking for good and has gotten straightened out.My sister supplied the beer and knew the consequences so now she will clean up the aftermath ............Mom has had quite the hangover and it hurts to see her like that but........I will be there for her as always but as I told my sister its time to step up and start to look after the woman who changed your diaper,wiped your nose and did all for you ........sister was totally shocked that I said what I said (and more) but hey it was time, you know..........I am getting better with each day but am not talking to many of the family members so that helps with the stress. I have had more love ,care and concern from HW and my ""lil"" family on here than with my blood family and it does hurt more than I can say but I will remember it ........I forgive but I may not forget ya know what I mean.............Howie and Cait have been rocks thru all of this and I have been soooo ""B""....Grumpy that I dont know how they have been able to deal with it ,and I get so upset with myself as I know that I am not angry at them just this DD ......Hope you are well and hope to yak more often ,miss you and stories about Dad ......and how is Mom by the way?...........give huggs to them both and a big hug and loads of love to you .........take care sis and God Bless .......


 Hey Lyn . . . Good for you sis. Your mom may not be able to learn from this, but your sister sure can. Cheers to you for speeking up. You are a class act sis. You waited till the perfect time arose to speak your mind and you ARE right. I'm glad you are healing. You've had a rough go. I'm glad that God blessed you with a hubby and daughter who love you like they do. Oh Emmie . . . you give me too much credit *blush*. I had another lovely day with dad. He painted the wheels on the car black and it is smashing!! We went shopping and bought popsicle sticks to make houses and stuff for him to paint. We also built a dupiclate car, so he can paint that one next week. Update on the Police Station . . . Dad escaped from home twice and went to visit the Police Chief the first time and the Fire Station the second time! He walked there!!!! He has always walked outside frequently, but never leaves the yard . . . mom is now trying to figure out how to deal with him leaving w/o any warning. I am actually laughing because the man is just so determined. The municipal center is only 1/4 mile down the street from them, but still, he had to cross a horrible intersection to get there. I can just see him holding up his hand to stop the traffic!! I think my brothers are going to add some locks to the doors. (BTW the only reason he couldn't see the chief the first time, was because he was on vacation) Oh Effie, I'm sorry you lost your dad so suddenly. I really do try to appreciate every minute with dad . . . I actually feel blessed to be able to spend time with him. Today when we were driving home from a car ride, he reached over and rubbed my arm very gently like he was saying ""I love you"". It was so sweet. IMHO: Effie, your visits with your dad that you and your son made DID NOT contribute to his depression. I bet that he does miss your dad, but my bet is that the memories he has formed and the fact that he was attentive helps him. Imagine how he would have felt if he had missed the opportunity to spend time with his grampa. You did good Effie . . . don't doubt that. Thanks for all your love sisters!! Blessings!


 Well Lyn . . last week I had one of those very painful days with him. He wanted to go to the police station to visit the chief. (Dad used to be a policeman, service director, mayor, county administrator . . . LOTS of public service). Anyway, we approached the counter at the police station and the whole wall above the counter was mirrored. There were teeny tiny pass-through holes under the counter to each attendant . . . . but you'd have to bend way over to see under. Well . . . there was dad looking at himself in the mirror and carrying on quite a conversation with himself. I was soooooo angry with the set up in there. I felt really weird knowing that they could see us and we couldn't see them. I understand that it is for their safety and all . . . but good Lord, put a phone in there or something. OK, I'll stop my rant. I don't know why it hit me so hard, but I was bummed for several days over the incident. It was just so demeaning. Yesterday though, I spent the day with dad and I gave him one of the three-D puzzles we made. It was an old fashioned car with a crank starter and it was made of wood. I gave him a paint brush and some paint and he painted for 45 minutes w/o any assistance from me!! I was actually so sleepy that I layed down on a nearby couch and just kept peeking at his progress and when he was done, he got up and cleaned up his mess!! I was soooo proud of him. And he was thrilled with his red car. Its been a while since he has done so well with our crafting. I know it was a gift from God to both of us . . . but it was SO appreciated!!! I hope you are still getting help from your family sis! Are you continuing to recover?? Blessings!


 Dear Rosie, I read your story and I started to cry. My Dad was taken from us suddenly, he had done very well but he was just starting to show signs of cognitive problems when he took a heart attack and died at the age of 84. My son and I spent every single Saturday night with him and one night through the week. We lived in another city, but regardless of weather we kept that commitment. My son gave up all of his Saturday night normal teenage social stuff to be with my Dad. I have no regrets. We also spent every single New Years Eve with him since my mom passed away when I was 18. A psychologist told me that my son's current depression is partially due to the fact that I made him live up to this committment. I disagree. I think my father taught him more than I ever could. I taught at this one school in several different capacities, teacher, consultant, resource worker, reading recovery, special education, kindergarten, and behaviour al class for 16 years. There was one elderly teacher, in her 80's who used to like to come and visit. When my friend and I were at that school we maintained a prayer that she had written and had the young children recite it everyday. She used to love to drop by and see that her prayer was still on the wall. Although most of the staff had changed I learned about her through my teaching partner one year. We would make a big celebration and make her feel like a queen when ever she came to visit. I am sure if you made a phone call to the police station and told them of your dad's employment history, they would allow you to drop by and visit one day behind the bars, and treat him like a king. Most professionals honor those that have done the job in the early days. I do not know much about Alzheimer's. Could you call and book a day in advance to take him and arrange a specific time? Or do you never know ahead of time, how an alzheimer's patient will be on any given day? If you could plan ahead, then maybe they could temporarily cover up the mirrors for like 5 or 10 minutes while your dad got to the back area. I am sure they would be honored to have him visit the station. Was it the actual station that he had worked from? I may be way off here, but I just wondered. Bless your heart. Both you and Lyn work so hard to make sure your parents have dignity and the best quality of life that they can have. I think we need more education on Alzehimers because if I had not read this site, I never would have known that mirrors and glass reflections were a problem. It makes sense, totally. However in all the years that I studied psychology, I do not ever remember being told that. Now mind you most of my psychology courses related to children and learning, but I did take a few basic courses as well. God Bless you both, inspite of your own pain, you watch over those that once watched over you. Crying again. It just makes me so sad to think of him in there feeling that way. But the story has a happy ending, because he painted his car red. We used to have one elderly gentleman that used to like to come to the school once a week just to tape up books that had a little tear or whatever. While he was there the kids would walk by and greet him, and he would just smile. After about an hour, his daughter in law would come pick him up and take him home. He was a great asset to the school. Unfortunately he died last year and I did not hear about it until the time was long passed. Thank God for the Rosie's and the Lyn's and the many others who post on this board for taking care of their loved ones. I know, but I do not fully understand, how hard it must be. I have never walked down that lane. But I take my hat off to all of the caregivers of elderly parents. Post Edited (effie) : 8/25/2005 12:34:04 AM (GMT-6)"
Anxiety & Alzheimers,"Lyn, How are you feeling this week??? I know you have been having a hard time for a while and wondered if things are any better. My question can wait . . . no need to answer today if you are feeling tired. . . just when you feel up to it. Do you know how much anxiety a patient should experience before considering the use of medication for anxiety? My dad has a very hard time being away from home. He can enjoy some things sometimes . . . but even something like golfing at the driving range lasts only 10 - 15 minutes and he wants to go home. He seems desperate to get back there and then he has nothing to do. It is very hard for mom to shop, as she takes him with her and he steers the cart toward the checkout at every turn. He is ok while we drive to one activity . . . but then he wants to get back to the house. If his doctor prescribed an anxiety med, could it be used 'as needed' or would it need to be an additional drug used every day?? Just wondering. Thanks Lyn . . . I appreciate your help.","AR........almost all anxiety meds would contract with his AD..........I dont suppose if you were to have a chat with him prior to going anywhere that would reassure him that you are only going out for a bit and WILL be returning home will work ....I have just gone thru this with my Mom and she always has me take her places we get there and she wants to come home .......it can get frustrating for the caregiver I know but we have to remember to the AD person like Mom and your Dad that is the only FOR SURE thing they do know and thats home............ .there they are not out of their element and they have a ""comfort zone "" when at home as they do get anxious ....I would ask the doc but they will no doubt try to persuade no meds in this case.........unless Dad becomes angry or really abusive .......it sounds like he just wants to be at home where to him all is well..................sorry I couldnt help other than that,but if we give them those meds then it does interact with the AD and makes them worse in my opinion .You could try the reinforced we are going out for 2 hrs ,show him the time and make sure he knows what time you will be back and then make darn sure you are lol and after a few times Dad might be a little more calm when he knows when he will be home .......Give him a hug for me ...you take care and God Bless


 Hey Lyn . . . How are you feeling this week???? I am a bit concerned about you.


 (((((((((((Lyn)))))))))) I bet that does take a lot out of you. The weight loss doesn't sound too assuring either. Sorry, I know nothing about chron's except that I don't want to get CD. Ouch! You are in my prayers sister!!! I'll stop right now and pray for you. Blessings!


 I don't recommend anianxiety meds.Why? They make them more anxiuos & detract away from AD meds.much as Benedryl does.


 Thanks Snowy and Lyn: Wow, I'm glad I didn't ask the doc about the anxiety meds . . . it is an HMO and I'm not always real sure of their competence because of some other things that have happened with mom and dad's medical care. Good suggestions Lyn . . . the time and watch thing used to work, but now he pretends he can read his watch (it's even upside down sometimes). The reason I try to take him out is to kill some time as he gets anxious for my mom to return. I can spend about 3 hours and he's ok, but then we run into the anxiety thing. Mom is going away with friends from the Senior Center for an outing and will be gone from 7:30 am until about 4 and I'm trying to figure out how best to keep Dad from feeling so anxious. I think the anxiety will come and go and might just last for 15 minutes at a time. I'll just plan some activities or bring some things ""I need help with"". Thanks so much for your help. I do appreciate it. Blessings!


 .....Thanks for asking I havent been well at all...losing wieght like there is no tomorrow and i am eating so I just dont get that .......last night I went into a full flare ...was in the br and felt like someone was ripping my guts out literally as well I was vomitting and had D as well ....pretty scary as I couldnt wake Cait or Howie up but I got out of there about an hour later .....my flares are getting worse it seems and it takes a lot out of ya ..............you take care and God Bless


 .Thanks for the prayers I sure need them ......take care you .................God Bless"
Would Like To Formally Introduce Myself,Good morning Lyn. I have a s-i-law with AD. It's been good to read many of the posts from there. I have only recently found Healing well but have found so many nice folks here and am sure I will learn so much from each one. Good luck to you. Carol,"Snowy: You have really had a full medical history!!! My goodness (((((((((Snowy))))))))). You are such an active upbeat person to have had so many medical problems. Snowy, YOU ROCK!!! LKE/Lyn: I would like to welcome you as our new moderator. Thank you for taking this on. Something I am very interested in is finding activities to do with dad. If anyone finds a web-site that has suitable activities, it would be a large help. I am finding it very thereaputic for him to do something with his hands and have a project to show people when they visit. It gives him something to fill his time and something to talk about. I can see him beaming when he takes me to the projects we have done together to show me. (He doesn't realize that we did it together.) Also, I have read a lot of Snowy's posts. She has posted a wealth of knowledge regarding appropriate meds and meds that shouldn't be taken by an AD person. It would be a great help if that information were collected and ""pinned"" to the top of the forum. We may even find some other helpful ideas that should be pinned. Lyn . . . maybe this forum will become more active now. Blessings!


 AlwaysRosie........one of my moms favorite things to do is look at old photos and we always pull them out and lay them on the floor.I thought it would be a good project as well as fun to make a collage of these pics so now she likes to make them at least once a week and has them in her room.I dont know if you and your dad would like something like that but just a thought. Another thing mom myself and my daughter do together is when the leaves have been falling we collect them and identify them and then take them home and i lay them out on saran wrap,a piece on bottom and lay out the leaves and then another piece over top and then she irons it or has my girl do it. i remember her helping me with this as aproject for school many many years ago lol.........But of couse that one is for the fall season..I dont know if these may be of interest to you but i hope so if not let me know and i am sure there are others that know of some great things for you and your dad to do together . God Bless You and Yours ..................................................LYN


 Thanks just found that out lol ....take care and I hope you and your dad are well


 AlwaysRosie.as well as mom helping me to put the pics just so i keep telling her who it is and I know she is able to pick out some of the family,I think this is why I honestly found it so rewarding for me as well........we put old pets in there ,her nursing school buddies all different things .well you get the picture right.I am going to try the puzzles that SnowyLynne had recommened with mom .I am sure she will just love it ..........God Bless


 AR..sure am glad I could help it was the jigsaw puzzles idea of Snowys that made that come to mind.My mothers house is a total walk down memory lane with pics and Cait(daughter) and I had to put together one for a school project years ago and so my mom loved that one and now it is a real great ritual that has given us real quality time together .It is especially so heartwarming to hear my mom LAUGH from the bottom of her tummy at some of these pics.....I hope you have as much fun and share as much with your dad doing this as I have with my mom.If you start going ""snap happy"" thats just great too.The more pics the better the collages.Have a great time........... God Bless ...................Taking pics of the jigsaw puzzles is an awesome idea .


 Oh . . . we had always used waxed paper . . . but after your post, I thought i would try plastic wrap and cover it with waxes paper to protect the iron. . . I just thought you had a way to do it that I hadn't heard!! LOL I never would have thought of leaves . . . we'll have to remember that next year. Thanks. Blessings!


 In the am I will be going over to pick Larry up at the rehab.hosp.bringing him home,then off to get him a badly needed haircut.


 SnowyLynne...........How is your husband doing? I hope you are doing okay today.We have one blast of a storm happening where I am in Ontario and here I thought we were done with the snow lol.Well maybe we will see you after hubbys haircut tomorrow?You are an asset to this forum SL and I hope we can discuss the ""old nursing touch""as per todays way of nursing.I was too a registered nurse for over 30 years and it is something I still miss each and every day.Take Care and God Bless.Looking forward to your input .............


 AR .SL and All others ...........Lets throw some ideas around for something like ""topic of the day"" know what I mean ......we need to get some ideas out there and get more peeps involved.Heres to a good day for us all.............GOD BLESS


 SnowyLynne.isnt that the truth even here in Canada,You are talking back in the ""good ole days"" when nurses were respected..knew their patients what the helth problem was and had EMPATHY.I dont think they cover too much of that nowadays but you will find the odd nurse out there that still believe in the old school.I am one and I know that you are as well...........My mom use to nur NOw they call Doc's by their first names .ME I cannot for the life of me do that lolse in the late 40s early 50s and she told me that when a doctor walked into the room the nurses were expected to stand up.......can you believe it?Hope your hubby is okay and enjoys his haircut .Take Care and God Bless


 Snowy: I trust that hubby is ok, since you didn't mention him. I bet you were *ell on wheels back in the day!! Heck, you are now!! LOL Lyn: The model car idea is great!!! He likes air-planes too. I will see what I can find before our next visit. Thanks so much! (Two heads ARE better than one!) Regarding topic of the day . . . great idea. I was thinking of that too, where you could make a post with a topic and people do add to it. You could go back through the old posts and ""bump up"" a good one now and then. . . or quote from it and start a new one . . or just get ideas from them. Go for it Blessings!


 Good Morning All........My name is Lyn and I was just made a moderator for the Alzheimers forum.As stated in previous posts my mother has AD and has had for over 7 years,I have been moms primary caregiver since her dx. I have been reading previous threads and posts and have come to know some of you or a bit of your situation thru them.I do hope that we together can make this a place to come where we can get support ...ask questions and get answers .......laugh together and if need be even cry together.I am hoping to be able to ask some of the more seasoned veterans for their help as I am sure i may stumble...............for too I am only human.SnowyLynne I look forward to yakking about our days as nurses and the changes that are now in effect,,,,,,,,,,,and to all the rest I hope you will pop in and say hello.I am on the crohns forum and have pyoderma gangrenosum.I look forward to meeting you all...........................................TAKE CARE and GOD BLESS.. ............................................................................................I Cant Change Your Past With All Its Heartache And Pain,Nor The Future With Its Untold Stories...............But I Can Be There Now When You Need Me To Care..................................God Bless...........................LYN


 Hey there! I also have Osteoporosis,Pernicious Anemia,HBP,Hypothyroid,Emphysema,Osteoarthritis that I've had since I was 25,most likely due to the 2 years I was on steroids from having ITP when I was 19.A Splenectomy was what saved my life. But I have AD too,that sucks,lol.But I'm a very high funtioning person with AD.That's why I am here,to maybe help others.


 Carol, SnowyLynne and AlwaysRosie............First I want to thank you for the warm welcome..........My God SL you have alot on your plate dont you , I think of you thru the posts that you are such a strong and vibrant woman with a wealth of information.I sincerely hope that we can all work together and make this forum come alive.........all your ideas everyone,as well as any input we will benefit from.I said in my first post I will stumble but I am a quick study(so dont hesitate to correct me and point me in the right direction) With SnowyLynns help we will get together the meds that are not for AD (I was in total shock over the ativan)..if you dont mind SL and any other information that would/could be useful for the caregivers and the people with AD..................Lets get this forum going ...........Thanks again for your kind and warm welcome GOD BLESS ALL I Cannot Keep Your Feet From Stumbling : I Can Only Offer My Hand...........That You May Grasp It..........And Not Fall......God Bless.....Lyn AlwaysRosie............I am sure if we all put are heads together we will come up with plenty of things for you to do with your Dad...........My mom and I do things and I will gladly post to see if any of this would be of interest to you .......................................................... Lyn Post Edited (LKE aka Lyn Kyle Emerick) : 3/1/2005 12:24:01 PM (GMT-7)


 Thanks LKE/Lyn . . . this sounds exciting!! BTW: If you go into ""Control Panel"" (upper left of screen) and then ""Edit Profile"" . . . you can save yourself some work by making a permanent signature with your quote underneath. Then it will always pop-into your posts. Blessings!


 Hey LKE/Lyn !!!! LOL we were posting at the same time!!! Yes, thank you for the ideas. Snowy was the one who told me about the jigsaw puzzles. I really didn't think much of it until I tried it . . . it has been a great success . . . thanks again Snowy!!! So I will try most anything!! Thanks. Blessings!


 LKE/Lyn: The pictures ARE great!! Mom and Dad's dining room has pictures of everyone hanging so we can point out the person we are talking about to Dad. One of my brother's put together a colage of racing pictures (dad owned and drove a stock-car when he was in his 40's and 50's) this colage is a constant source of pride for him. He shows me several times each visit and we talk about the race days and the crashes and the car repair etc., etc. . . So the pictures are a SUPER idea!! Maybe I should take my camera with me and add some new ones!! We'll take pictures of the jigsaw puzzles that he put together . . . sounds like fun! Thanks again!!!! Blessings!


 Always Rosie .was just looking at where i posted about the leaves .well i meant to say waxed paper lol .can you imagine ironing saran wrap ........................that would be something i would do ha ha...........take care all .and God Bless


 I will be on in the early am if everyone would like to get some ideas together on how we can keep this forum up and kicking.................SnowyLynne I know you will have some great input on what we can do .I have to go and check on mom and dad and make sure all the lights are out except for the one we call ""OLE FAITHFUL"" and turn on her lifeline.My dad is at the house with her but it is hard for him as she sometimes only wants me or that girl (cait) there.My head is so full of ""threads' right now so I will write them down and anyone else out there please..............lets make this the livliest forum going .Its almost 7 pm in ontario CANADA so i had better get over ther mom likes to be tucked in with her pillows and blankets a special way no later than 730(tends to get restless) so i will check in later and first thing in the am .....God Bless YOU ALL


 Dear Snowy, I trust that Larry is your hubby. Do have a good day with him . . . I hope he is feeling better. Blessings Snowy, Lyn: You live in Ontario? Hmmmm I have family in Midland, Penetang and Barrie. Where in Ontario are you? Blessings!


 Always Rosie.I live about an hour east of Windsor in a real small town,but we love it here and Cait has only ever gone to school here and our Church family is all close by.Barrie is about 4 hrs east then north of here .It is beautiful up around there.We went there as kids for camping.Do you ever get the chance to come this way to visit your family members?............................To get back to something you said about your dad?,He enjoys working with his hands right well would he be up to putting models together.they have ones with larger pieces and you could help him but I bet he would get the idea in no time .Down here you can get the fairly cheap(pricewise) ones.all different kinds of models but he is into the cars right and they do have racecars and stockcars and then of course the regular model cars.If he would be interested in that you are able to find the ones that are fairly easy to start off with and then try taking him a step higher...............only if thats something that he and you could enjoy together.My mom is a nic nac fanatic and I must confess so am I lol and the time it takes to dust everyone of those lil gems of hers is unreal but that is another thing we do together.If I am feeling up to it she will have me vacuum 3 /4 times a day.............God I love her to death and she makes me smile even if its just once a day ........when I see MOM in her eyes. Gonna go see if I can get some sleep.....will yak in the morning.God Bless


 I was a CNA for 30 yrs.BUT I'm from the old school,Adies can't do anything now,just turn,dry,wipe,thaasit!Oh yeah,they clean bedpans,wheelchairs,bathrooms,bedside commodes.lol. I did much more when I started out in the 60's,even in the military hosp.in Spain,I did more.Now,an aide isn't much more than a housekeeper.They are not trained to look for specifics like I was.I would refuse to do much with a patient until I knew what the health problem was,for fear of hurting the person.They could have fired me for that,but they didn't.I was miss persnickity.Now,you have to beg aides to empty a bedside commode,as most could care less.That's the way it is here in North Texas. Keeping the aide ignorant is what the NH do,cuts the losses I guess.


 I had many Drs.tell me I ask alot of questions just being an Aide,would laugh,& answer any questions I had.I did have thier respect,& they knew I was up on the lates things,as they would quiz me.I was as a LVN or RN to them,even though I wasn't one.It's not anywhere near like that now,& that's sad.No wonder the aides won't do anymore than they have to now.BUT that still doesn't excuse them.


 Snowy...............that is too funny ,I cant count the number of times i was asked if I had plans of becoming a doctor.I was always reading up on the newest techniques and constantly asking questions on rounds .I did get wrote up for interuppting a doctor once during rounds,but it was my own fault as he was directly asking his intern a question and the answer was in my head and then it just came out of my mouth lol................when I had my rest home I did all the work that I expected from my staff,and without hesitation.Just because I had a title I still was there for the residents/patients and I really believe that we had a home like atmosphere with all of working together for the common goal of our residents.Respect and Dignity was of the utmost importance to me then and still is ..these people have lived 70 80 90 plus years and they have earned that..I dont think that is asking to much.When I see a person charged with hurting an elderly patient or any patient that has entrusted you with their life it makes me so angry my blood boils and I will NEVER understand how this happens or why.Yes nurses are human and we get frustrated but to the point of doing something to harm another being? We are/were there to help and make that person feel better and we are in a trusted position:those patients hand their lives over to us ultimately(yes to the Doc as well but they only do so much)they have to come to terms with us being their way in bed/out so on and so on I know you understand where I am coming from here as you are from the old school.I get hyped up talking about this abuse of patients .can you tell ?lol It sure feels good to talk about this.I miss working horribly but i do alot of volunteering in the community as well with the seniors so I still get that interaction. There still are some darn good nurses out there and I would be willing to bet that they were trained by nurses such as you with the old school rules and caring/giving hearts......God Bless Hope Larry is doing well"
Bad day,"Today was wretched. Papa's sister died, and he flew out this morning to go to the funeral. He asked Nana if she wanted to go with him, and she said no up until we got to the airport to drop him off. Then for the next few hours she thought he didn't love her anymore and that he wouldn't let her go with him. I kept explaining to her that there wasn't enough time for her to get a ticket, but she was crying and was very upset. Then, we took my dog to the vet, where I was told she probably was sick and have to wait a few days to find out why. So all day I was crying about that and Nana was comforting me, until she forgot why I was crying and thought it was because I didn't like her. But we went out to dinner and had a good time. Then, when we got home, she wanted to send out flowers to the funeral, but everywhere was closed or something, so we have to wait until tomorrow, which she is none too pleased. But, on a good note, she made a cup of coffee today! Usually, she just tells people what she wants until someone gets it for her, but today she was very mad when I got up to make it. She got out the cups, coffee, put the kettle on, and made some coffee. She was so proud! I had a question, but I forgot it... soo... the end! (sorry for the pointless post, I'll make up for it later)","Today was a lot better. Mom was home, which was good. I don't usually fall asleep until after 3 in the morning, and Nana gets up around 8, so I got to sleep in *yay*. So, after I got up, I heard about how Shiloh (our sick dog) threw up all over the living room, I gave her something to ease her tummy, and we went out to IHOP for lunch. Then we went and saw The Wedding Date (I didn't like it, but Nana was very impressed), came home and Shiloh threw up all over the living room again. So we took her to the emergency vet clinic and they said she's going into ketone acidosis or something that sounds like that, so she's spending the night at the hospital and they said she'd be fine as soon as she got some insulin and fluids in her (she's lost almost 6 pounds in a week). Nana was very concerned and had us call Papa so she could tell him (this is his favorite dog out of the three). So she called him up and said the black and white dog was sick (they're all black and white, hehe) and said not to worry, that everything would be ok, and that we'd see him tomorrow. She's very sweet. Before we left, she told Shiloh that she loved her and she was the cutest darn dog she'd ever seen and other such lovely things. Then the whole way home she went on about how great Shiloh was. Even called her the best dog in the world, which never happens because she usually thinks our Chihuahua, Kirby, is the best dog in the world. Nana keeps trying to do stuff, but Mom and Papa get worried that she'll fall or something, so they do it for her. I talked to Mom today about how important it is to Nana to do stuff on her own, and she let off a little, but watches Nana like a hawk when she's walking around the house (she has bad balance and recently had to go to the ER a bunch and get admitted due to hurting her back when she fell once) and looks really nervous. But it makes Nana happy, so Mom'll just have to deal with it.


 Yes, I sort of caught up on sleep last night. Nana doesn't like to sleep by herself, so I slept in her room last night. I was planning on just lying down until she fell asleep (I have the world's supply of homework to do this weekend and had decided this weekend will be work weekend, but everything kept getting in the way... the one chance I've had so far to actually get some studying done was ruined because the power went out, lol), but everytime she looked asleep she'd wake up when I got halfway out of the bed. So today, in between driving to different vet clinics, Mom helped Nana shower, and then I washed her hair and styled it for her. Then I did her makeup and Mom helped Nana pick out the perfect outfit to wear to pick up Papa from the airport. Then they went to pick up Papa, and came back and made dinner. Nana's favorite thing to do everyday is set the table. And to read the mail and distrubute it to everyone. She seems to have a lot more energy than she's had in the past few months. Lately, she's been wanting to get her liscence back, so she's been reading my old driver's ed book. She keeps thinking that Papa is trying to keep her from driving and is refusing to let her get her liscence back. So she and Papa went over it tonight. A jigsaw puzzle sounds like a great idea! I should try working on one with Nana. What was on the puzzle y'all did? Nana has a hard time being away from her home, too. I've found it impossible to keep her out for more than three hours. On Sundays, we go out and do stuff so Papa and Mom can go over whatever. They want me to keep her out from 1-6, which I have yet to do. Did you and your Dad ever go for that pedicure? Sorry for the long post! Drank waaay too much coffee tonight.


 I would stay home with Nana and let them go out, but all they want to do is organize the house (seriously... how many times a month does this need to be done?) and pay bills. They're no fun. They won't even go out to lunch with us on Sundays. Oh, well... Nana and I have lots of fun without them. I brought my Harry Potter books over to my grandparents' house so Papa could read them. Nana loves them! She thinks they're the silliest. She keeps running off with the one I'm reading now, though. Yesterday, she was sleeping on the couch with three of them on her lap. I didn't have as much homework as I thought I did. I only have to study for my government test tomorrow. All the other stuff was postponed a week, thank goodness! Hehe, I was trying to study last night, but I was so tired and the book wasn't making sense, so for a while I thought I had drifted off and was dreaming that I was studying.


 Less yes, but I still have 7ish more chapters to read. All but one are less than 5 pages, though. Blah!!! I need to go do silly stuff tomorrow to balance out all this responsible grown up stuff I've been doing. Nana likes to have the paper in front of her. I don't think she actually reads it, except for laughing at the headlines (she finds just about everything amusing, which I think is awesome). But she'll ask me whenever I walk by if I've read it. It's a good conversation starter for her. That's awesome your Dad is having a good time at the library. Does he usually check out a book or just look around?


 PIxieDustStorm and AlwaysRosie........................You both have fullest admiration and blessings.Both are Angels, sending PRAYERS and plenty of Good thoughts your way.......MAY GOD BLESS and KEEP YOU ALL HEALTHY and SAFE


 AlwaysRosie....Yes hun I do have a loved one with AD.my mom .and I take care of her as well as try to take care of self lol.I have crohns and pg which sometimes makes it difficult but my hubby and daughter are always there for back up.You take care and GOd will help even in the darkest times God BLess


 PixieDustStorm.....................We are setting up chat for Sunday afternoon you are most welcome to join ...check the calander and the thread so you know what time to meet us in there.I hope things are getting better for you and your Papa it will take time as you know......but with the love and care you give to your papa and nana they will make out just fine .I commend you on your selflessness and the love you share with these special people in your life..............I wish that there were more like you out there ......Take Care ....God Bless


 Its great to hear that Nana is coming around hun.....my mom has those good times as well and those are the best she too has such a great sense of humor.I found that the doc had given her ativan(i was not at that app) and she had hidden them so I didnt know she was taking them till I realized that something just wasnt right.Since she isnt taking them she is not so upset and confused either.Am happy for your Nana that she is looking forward to her daughter and grandaughter coming I wish them a great day and you too.............you take care and GOD BLESS


 Hey Pixie!!!!! I haven't seen you around for quite a while . . . I hope you and Nanna are still ok. . . post when you get a minute so we know you are ok. Blessings!


 Hey Pixie . . . Sorry you had such a crumby day. sorry about your Papa's sister (your great aunt?) too. Poor doggie!!!! ((((((((doggy))))))))))) ((((((((((((Pixie))))))))))))))) . . . I hope he/she is ok . . . Sounds like a little nana had a moment with the coffee eh? That's great. You should just brush yourself off and give yourself a big pat on th back . . . so happy you could be there with nanna. Imagine the alternative. Hope tomorrow is better!! Don't forget to update about your doggie too! Blessings!


 Pixie . . . glad to hear you got some sleep. LOL. Hope that Shiloh is well and back home fast. Your Nanna sounds a lot like my dad. Dad had a visit here today with mom . . . he did quite well and they stayed over an hour (which is good for him). It is good that your Nanna wants to do stuff. Dad and I worked a 30 piece jigsaw puzzle on Monday and mom said that he has guarded it all week and has finally taped it all together. I plan to find more as we did spend some amount of time on that and he enjoyed 'helping' me. Let me know if you find more stuff that Nanna likes to do. Blessings!


 Hey Pixie!!! The puzzle we did had a very nice rabbit . . . Dad liked that. It is easiest for me to stay with Dad at his house and let mom get out. Maybe your mom and papa could try that. Or a combination of staying with her at the house and going out. Pedicure hasn't happened yet because I go over on Mondays and beauty places are closed on Mondays around here. I hope you found time for that homework . . . I used to hate that feeling of having it pile up. After I was out of school I had many dreams of not getting it done. ughhhhh!! Blessings!


 LOL Pixie . . . I get lots of housework done in my sleep!!!! I'm glad your homework was LESS than you thought. Hooray!!! That was God's blessing to you for taking such good care of Nanna. Dad likes the newspaper. If I bring him a news-paper he is excited. We can even go shop for a news-paper. We went back to the library and I thought he didn't want to stay . . . so I started to walk out and he suggested we look around!!!!! That is a first. He actually wanted to hang around for a bit . . . I think he is doing better (or am I just getting used to things?) Anyway. . . Good that Nanna likes the Harry Potter books!!! Blessings!


 Dad talks to strangers (which can be good or bad) and he was helping me pick out computer software (games) . .. but we haven't found a good one yet ( his computer doesn't have sound). We hae also sat at their computers and go on the internet. He like to work the mouse and he does well with it too! But ultimately he ends up by the newspapers and wants to check one out. So we usually go righ after and just buy one. If we bring home a computer game he guards it all week till I come back. . . so he doesn't know my name but he will associate the game with me. Hope your reading is all done. Have a good day! Blessings!


 Lyn . . . you are too kind. I so enjoy spending time with Dad. Do you have a loved one with AD? See, I don't have the caretaker role . . . I just get to be the 'good guy' that visits. Mom is the Angel!!!! She deals so well with this and I know it is a big job . . . but she makes it look like every-day stuff. Thanks your your kind words!!! Blessings!


 Lyn - Thank you for your prayers and good thoughts. :) Much appreciated.


 Aw, you're going to make me blush. Sundays are my Nana days, but depending on the time I'll see if I can make it. We usually go out around noon and are back by three. Things are getting better. For some reason, she's seeming less confused and worried and back to her normal self (that being half a year ago, but still, it's nice). She has got her sense of humor AND her hearing aids back, which is awesome. She's all excited because her daughter and grandaughter are coming to visit Sunday.


 Hey Pixie!!! Glad you posted . . . haven't seen you for awhile. I finally got dad in for that pedicure. He really liked it. It was very confusing for him at first, the odd chair etc. But once he relaxed . . . he liked it all. His chair had a very nice massage mechanism in it too. I sat next to him but could afford to pedicures LOL. (Mom said, his feet where fine when you left here!) I hope that didn't offend her. She never would do anything like that. I have even given her gift certificates. . . that's just not her cup of tea I guess. Dad and I did ""Fun Pad"" (the little books with dot to dot and mazes and follow the dots) He really enjoyed it too. It's sure nice to hear that Nanna is having some kind of repriev!! I hope it sticks!! Godd timing with her family coming. Mom just bought some Mangoneene juice for dad to see if it helps. Her neighbor said that after 6 months of using it he is doing much better. Blessings!


 I second AR on this one Pixie .where are you and how are you doing ?........Please post and let us know k we arw missing you ......take care and God Bless"

Dementia or depression?,"Hello everyone, I'm new here, hmmmm where do i start? at the begining i guess,,,,,,,,so mother had a brain tumor for which she received WBRT (whole brain radiotherapy) ,,,,,,,,,now after the tumor recurred it was surgically removed.....now I've only got the wrapping,,,,,,,she's here but her mind is somewhere else, most of the time.......I've been reading on WBRT that it causes some sort of demylination and consequently progressive dementia but her MRI doesn't show that........Her doctor sid she's gonna need rehab, both physical and psychological........we've been doing that for almost a month now........I got a book called ""The 36-hour day"" a Johns Hopkins book.......it helps a bit, I got her a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist.........what else should i do? I try to work on her reading and writing, today was a good day, the past couple of days were very trying to both of us.....she barely uttered a word, it was like i was handling a barbie doll........suggesttions?","Hi Snowden, Dad is less and less able to understand verbal communication. But I have found that he still does well with body language and miming. I just have to keep reminding myself that it helps. He also reads faces extremely well. I hope you are able to find a similar key with your mom, it is so sad when communication goes down the tubes. Might your mom enjoy some of the music from her day??? I play some of Dad's old stuff and and he really likes it. Mom even plays polka music to get him to exercise. They dance around the dining room table and have a lot of fun. Hugs for you sis!! Blessings!

 Hi Snowden and Welcome to HW.........IMHO ,.I do not think there is anything harder than seeing your parent(s) go thru this and having to take on the parent role .....Just want you to know that you are not alone and there are great peeps on here that will help you out in anyway they can ........In the yellow box at the side of the screen you will find AD resources and it is great info ........The book you got is a very good one and many on here have it ......I would think after what your Mom went thru she will need more than a month of therapy,but I am not a doctor so maybe you should ask Him/Her about the length of time it normally may take ........At least now you know you are not alone ........Take care and God Bless you for doing all of this for your MOm.............Lyn


 Both my parents love to listen to music .......ffom their time though lol.............have radio on the way oldies for them ........okay and me lol.......God Bless .....Lyn"
Odd memory and perception,"Hello..I usually post on the Cardio board on here as I had a rather serious heart attack early last year but recently have been experiencing some odd problems mentally which I wanted to run by anyone here familiar with AD...I have always had a very sharp mind which makes these thing all the more worrisome to me..( I drive a small delivery truck and deliver truck parts by the way ) Just as an example all the following things happened just today alone: 1)I had a delivery to make to ashop named Coastal Crane and even though I looked at the invoice and read that I headed to a place named United Crane...2)I was suppose to take a hubcab and 4 lights to a Penske shop and actually told the guy there that`s what I was brining him but went back to my truck and got 2 pressure valves and left them there ( I had to turn around and go back later )..3)A customer called on the phone and was asking about a jack and I looked right at the sign on the one in front of me which clearly said it was ""12 tons"" and even while looking right at it I told him I had a ""22 ton"" jack in stock...4)I did 2 other things like that today which bothered me but now I can`t even remember what they were...5)When I got home I was getting a soda and went and got a glass out of the cabinet then got a soda from the fridge. I wanted some ice but for some reason I picked up the glass and turned and opened the cabinet with the glasses in it again instead of the freezer..Oi My mother was diagnosed with AD about 2 years ago and is on medication for it..She`s 83..I`m 48...When I had my heart attack last year my heart was stopped for a few minutes and I stopped breathing but I didn`t notice a lot of mental impairment right after that..Any input would be appreciated","HI there .........If you are that worried I would get yourself checked as Snowy has stated.......Myself I do things like you are doing on a day to dat basis but I think with me its brain overload ..........take care and let us know .......God Bless .......Lyn


 .....Sara .......Just wondering how you are doing ...........God Bless .....Lyn


 Jo..............That is not true at all hun,Alzheimer's is able to be detected thru numerous tests and getting to a neurologist is the best thing to do .............Thanks for you post and hope to see you againn soon .......God Bless Lyn........BTW.......I was not trying to sound rude at all I just thought I would let you know that Alzheimer's Research has come along way and they are numerous ways to detect it ........Lyn


 .....Sara .....When you did that delivery did you happen to have anything to do with ""hoses"" on your mind?? ........Like maybe watering plants or something akin to that ....I am asking you this as I will sometimes do the exact thing ......lol........Am glad you are going to the Doc's to get checked out ............In my opinion and from what I saw with my AD patient's they too would be on meds but did still do things/say things that were pretty out there ...........Please keep us posted on how it goes at the doc's office .....Take care and God Bless.........Lyn


 It's not out yet, but there is a new test coming, which is supposed to catch alzhiemer's in early stages. It is an eye exam and uses one peice of equipment to do a quick check and then another if the first is positive. The newsfeed did not say when it is expected to be approved for use. Human tests are being done with the first test; the other tool is still being tested on animals and will have to go through human testing too. As to your problem. I was sick years ago and didn't know it. I went to the doctor when I insisted that Columbus discovered America in 1942 and was angry at my son for trying to tell me it was 1492. Soon after I couldn't count change. When I went back to work a year later, I practiced counting on the drive to work--I couldn't make it past 68. Once when I went to work on a cloudy day, I started to get out of the car and thought it looked dark--so it must be night. I got back in, drove home, and started supper. I eventually got back to performing at as a high level as before, by concentrating diligently and keeping my surrounding quiet. I worked 20 more years, til 62 and have only minor memory problems now, but fear Alzhiemers--my mother and grandmother both had it. Many other things can cause what you described. My thought is that you should see the doctor ASAP. The odds are that I would have recovered completely, if I had earlier treatment. bev


 If you feel the need get am appointment with a Neurologist & be tested.You are not too young to get AD.


 Dear Sara, My sister recently had a heart attack, in August of 2004. She had to take a year off of work and was paid a disability salary. At first she did not experience any symptoms of depression. She did have pain around the area where they did a bypass (triple), When she was first released from the hospital she was quite fearful, almost terrified, of going out in the car. Her doctors had told her that if the air bag was activated for some reason that her heart would not be able to take the stress of that sudden, heavy pressure on her incision site. She experienced swelling, in the shape of a banana at the incision site. So her initial response to the heart attack was fear of all the possible things that could go wrong after the surgery. Prior to her heart attack she led a very full life as a professional with an active social life, a happy marriage, and was in excellent physical health and worked out regularly. It was a rare day when she would even need to take a Tylenol. Then she started thinking about how close she could have come to death, and started trying to change her lifestyle and how she managed everyday stress and the stress of her job. Suddenly she became overcome with depression. The more depressed she got the more she experienced confusion, mood swings and short term memory problems. Apparently some of this was also related to her body adjusting to all the meds she now had to take. Now she seems to have the depression under control and her memory has improved and so has her mood. Having an unpredicted fright to your health, along with the major changes that you have to make in your life are surely stressful. I do not think it work hurt to have a check up with a neurologist to ease your mind and reduce your stress. I recently had two different MRI’s which showed some changes in my brain, I do not understand these results yet. The first radiologist said it was possible that I had MS. After spending a few minutes with the neurologist he requested that I have a second MRI so we could compare the two sets of results. He told me he was much more concerned about what appeared to him to be a reactive depression, rather than MS. The neurologist strongly felt that I required therapy to deal with the fact that I had suddenly been hit with a chronic illness which is life altering. I now have so many limitations as to what I can do, and on top of that the pain is often excruciating. Bottom line is it would never hurt to get things checked out that you are worried about , but let's pray that it is just a temporary thing that will go away with time and as you make all the adjustments that you are dealing with. Keep us posted. God Bless, Judy/Effie


 Sara TG, I also think that stress and being in our age category, (45+)with all of the things going on with that.........aging parents, kids, etc.......may be your problem!!!my brain is all over the place with life's stresses!!!!I'm by no means an expert on Alzheimer's but I think others around you would be noticing other symptoms from you....still, get checked out by a doc....(even though from what I understand, they can't definitely prove the person had it, until after an autopsy.....sorry , but that's what I've heard).....hang in there!


 Hello..Thanks for asking..I am fine..I`m not sure if my heart attack etc are to blame..I`m actually less stressed now than I was before it..Being dead really mellowed me out in life ...Plus that was 18 months ago and I just started noticing these things within the past 2 months of so...As far as other people noticing maybe several times a day people will catch me saying the wrong thing and say ""Huh?""..Like today I went to deliver some belts to someone and told the guy at the office I had his hoses..He just said, ""Hoses??""..I right away corrected myself..Most of the bigger mistakes no one catches as I go out on my delivery runs alone and can back track and correct any places I`ve missed or parts I forgot..I seem to be making more spelling errors also when I type but usually catch them before clicking ""Send""...I go and see my doctor on Nov 1st and will ask about it...My mom who lives with us has AD and is on medication but even still she does and says some really wild things..Best wishes to everyone


 Lyn, thanks for pointing out my error, and no offense at all for being corrected!I want to be informed, not bury my head in the sand.haha..............My boyfriend's mother has Alzheimer's, but he and his family would much rather live in denial......turn a deaf ear to my suggestions.I spend time trying to research, and I could have sworn I saw that it has to be diagnosed only after an autopsy.(but I also stopped researching when I saw that my knowledge wasn't wanted)""mom's just slipping a bit"" is the main take they have.But aging parents are tough, no matter what the problems are...AD is just especially heart wrenching...my prayers are with you all..........

When It's Alzheimer's,"Hello everyone, I am new here and would like to say that is a beautiful poem... I too write poetry and have a book, Being Mamas' caregiver for three and a half years inspired me to write my feelings in poetry form and later to write in bookform our experiments as to what this family endured as Alzheimer's took it's toll on such a beautiful lady. God Bless All who are experiencing the devastation of such a disease as this! When It's Alzheimer's . . . Watching her while she sits not knowing where she is For just a brief moment I could feel a soft warm kiss When as a child, she'd tuck me in wiping tears from her eyes ""Sleep peacefully, my sweet girl, dream only of butterflies For they remind us of new beginnings when all is well and done Do not be troubled in your life wake each day with appreciation"" I had watched her mind fading fast her dreams had all vanished Memories of her loved ones she'd forgotten those she cherished When it's Alzheimer's this cruel disease had taken away her life Making her forget her children or that once she was a wife Not remembering who we were was the worst I recall When it's Alzheimer's it really cut deep She was my Mother after all . . . .

 Hey Lyn, How did your Doctor appt. go . . ?"
My mom has had the visible signs of Alzheimers,"First let me say how happy i am to have found this forum! My mom has had the visible signs of Alzheimers for the past 3-4 years. She lived in Greece (where i grew up) and i had to go pick her up and bring her here to MA. I have been able to take care of her and my dad pretty well so far but lately her memory has not only gotten worse but her walking worries me sometimes. Also she tends to stay in bed too much and not interact ( my dad isn't a big talker and i'm not home some of the day). I was thinking of getting someone to help her out. Right now i have work, i'm taking care of mom and dad and the housework....... and three dogs and a cat (my one dog is diabetic and blind and on insulin). Its getting to be way too much for me. I don't know how to go about getting someone to care for her. Someone who would do some light housework and keep mom company during the day- as well as take care of some of her needs like bathing and toileting. She still walks around ok in the house and her memory isn't bad enough yet...... i'm trying to avoid a nursing home as long as i possibly can. My other concern is how much money would it cost to have someone come in..... even if its a few times a week to take a little pressure off me. Where do i look for someone and can i even afford it? I had someone taking care of my aunt in Greece and that girl is very interested in coming over here. She has a small child though and i think it would be difficult..... I don't know what to do. Can anyone suggest anything at all? Thank you for any help! Post Edited By Moderator (Admin) : 8/23/2005 9:42:34 AM (GMT-6)","Hi Angell! Welcome to the forum!! Yup!! There is one in every family. Mighty Woman!!!! to the rescue!! Good idea to get some house help and company for your mom. As things progress with my dad we have found that he is eligible for some Hospice care too. You might look into that depending on how bad off your mom is. God bless you for taking care of your mom and everything else you do. Don't forget to make your needs a priority too sis!! Blessings!

 Dear Angel, God Bless You for taking care of your parents. And for taking care of your poor doggie. That in itself would be a big enough work load for me. I am not well now. However when I was younger I was widowed at a young age and had a son to raise. My job was very demanding with long hours. I had tried various types of care giving for my son before and after school and I hired a cleaning lady once a week to help out. However the best thing I ever did was to hire a nanny from another country. First I hired a recently widowed grandma from Korea. She wanted to come to Canada. She had family here. It turned out her family lived close to my home, so she just stayed with me during the day and evening and went home at night. But that woman was a life saver. After about two years she got home sick so she returned to Korea. My next nanny was from Finland. She was a young girl. She did not do much around the house, but she was good with my son. Same story she got homesick and returned to Finland. My third nanny was from Ecuador. She was actually a medical doctor in Ecuador. She also had family here. She lived with me during the week and went home to her family on the weekends. I found all of these nannies, just by word of mouth. I mentioned to work colleagues that I was looking for someone. Nearly everyone seemed to know someone who wanted the opportunity to live in Canada or the States. So I just had to prove to the government that I had put out ads in the local paper and did not find a suitable Canadian, and then I was allowed to hire these people. I always found they were hard working, honest, and were good company for me too!!! When I came home exhausted dinner was always cooked and I had someone besides my dog and cat and little guy that I could talk to. I also found their rates were reasonable. When my son was older, I was able to allow them to pursue English classes or other daytime jobs as long as they were available for before school and about three hours after school. If they had other work, I paid them less because they did less housework. So if I were you I would definitely look into it. How old is the child of this woman in Greece? Do you have the space? Are your animals good with children? I know very little about Alzheimer’s. But I do know about taking care of parents, and the loneliness and frustration of trying to be all things to all people. If you ever want to just vent or talk my email is on my profile, just click on my name. My heart goes out to you. You are really being an angel to your parents. Do you think your mom sleeps because of boredom, or is it a side effect of meds? Did your parents ever live in the US before? How well do they speak English? Are there any day programs that your mom could go to? A friend of mines mom had Alzheimer’s and while it was in the early stages there was a day program, paid for by the city that she could go to. She had to bring lunch in a brown paper bag. That part did not impress my friend's mom since she was used to a hot lunch. However, the city sent a special little mini bus to pick up her mom and drive her back home. I think she went two or three times a week and she said it was a life saver for her. She made friends at the program and enjoyed the crafts that they did. Sometimes school groups or church groups would come in and do a little presentation for them. My friend also got to meet some other people who were caring for parents with Alzheimer’s like herself. Perhaps they would let your dad go along as well. You might also consider seeing if there is a “Greek” centre in your neighbourhood that runs programs. Just a thought. Take care, and god bless, Effie/Judy"
Message to send,"It is three years since I removed my wife from a nursing home. She had given up on life, had lost speech and suffered loss of weight also preasure sores. Within months of arriving home her condition got worse and was rushed to hospital. She was given no chance of survival, so I insisted on taking her home. It has been my choise to care for her on my own and to my great joy she has thrived in my company. Her weight has increased from 72lbs. to 120lbs. She's has Alzheimer's for the past ten years,she is 71 and I'm 74. When everyone else had believed she had reached the end I chose to go it alone. It is the best thing I have ever done in my life. When there is no movement except for the head I have discovered so very much about caring for the effects of Alzheimer's on my wife. Is there anyone out there like me who has made up there mind to care for a loved one alone to the end? If so we just maybe able to learn from one another. Padraig","Hi and Welcome ...to answer your question ,yes I have just recently lost my Mom she also had AD and I looked after her at home as well my step dad has this DD and I look after him .I have always maintained that their quality of life HAS to be met in all areas and in the nursing home field (where I also worked ) you sometimes cannot reach that goal not all by yourself ....As Snowy has posted their are good ones out their but I am a firm believer that if it is POSSIBLE for you to look after youer loved ones then do so .......The memories I cherish are totally different then those of my siblings they were never thr thru all the good ,bad and all the other, when Mom would get nasty and unruly it was I that was there.....I had told Mom yrs ago never would I let her go to a home (she was a highly respected Nurse in her field) and I did have some rough times because of my own illnesses but I got thru it with the help and friends I have come to know on this site peeps such as Snowy and my wonderful Rosie have gotten me thru so much ....there are other great peeps on here as well ,Sandra and all the rest its early and I am sorry I do know them by name lol,...you will come to know these peeps and find the help comfort and empathy here you are looking for .....You will be in my heart and prayers ............it is a hard but rewarding thing to look after our loved ones I am so glad you chose to do this for your wife ........God Bless....Lyn

 How are we this Morning Charlie ,Rosie and Snowy .....God Bless........Lyn


 Hi Lynn!! I want you to know that I have survived the week of moving things around upstairs to make a guestroom and a sewing room!! Hubby did all the heavy stuff, but it was still a very busy week for me. Then I enjoyed the visit from my son and his wife (what a doll) and my granddogger (Edgerrr) who is the offspring of my two little Westies. We had a great visit and I entertained a housefull for two days. Am not feeling the feared afteraffects (NO FLARE!!) Yeahhh!! Praise God. This really shows me that I am turning the corner with this Lupus. Thanks for asking Lynn . . . how are you sis? Padraig . . . you are such a dear!!! How romantic. You are one in a million and it does my heart good to here about your tender care for your wife. Do make it a point to find that book I mentioned. I think you'll enjoy it!! Blessings!


 Sis I am so happy to hear that you have been kept healthy thru all of this ........Am also glad that your visit was a good one as well .....I have had a few rough days but am getting by with you and and all the others here on HW .....I believe Padraig has been sent to us in our times of need .......as I do also believe that we are kindred spirits :you and I ........I was going to call tonight but I am going to leave it til tomorrow as I am taking Dad out for supper and a walk just to get him out of the house for a wee bit ........Love you sis .......keep well and be strong ......Always thinking of you and your MOm and Dad .........God Bless....Sis

 Hi Lyn and the gang, I have read so much and heard so much on the subject of AD. I believe I can be of help to people who care for loved ones, but where to start. I have said how I removed my wife Jean from a nursing home over three years ago. Caring for her on my own up to the time of a fall, breaking her arm, and dislocated her shoulder and her admittance to hospipal. How I wish now what I knew then. I just know she would have walked out of hospital as she walked in after a month's stay. They druged without my knowledge and I received her back in a wheelchair. Now she could no longer stand. We lived in the dream house I promised her when we did'nt have two pennies to rub together. It was a large six-bedroomed property in the remote countryside of Herefordshire. The grandchildren had grown up and we were now on our own. There was also the land to look after. She was moved six times in as many weeks.The pain I was put through was too much and I had a breakdown, and left with a very painful decision to place her in a nursing home. The pain continued as I made the daily visits to the home, 30 mile round trip. To see her lose weight and develope preasure sores. I asked her ""are you giving up?"" she nodded, ""Yes"". I cried begging her to hang on, promising to take her home as soon as I got a smaller place nearer to her. I sold our dream home of 25 years and bought a 4 bedroom town house. On taking her home packages of medication I was given I rejected, handing them over to our GP. I decided to go it alone from here on in. The first few months were the worst. It had reached a stage where she drifted in and out of consciousness. I was advised not to sit holding her hand overnight as she was likely to pass away when I went for a drink or go to the toilet. I was also told not to force feed. The advice fell on deaf ears, here we are three years later. I use a baby's bottle for her drinks except for her morning drink of NESTLE Build-up laced with a spoonful of honey. I'll close here with this: one morning in the early stages I noticed her in a panic as she dressed with one red sock one white. ""What's the problem love?"" ""I'LL be late for school"". ""Oh don't worry, I'll have a word with the Headmaster, I like your socks, there's another pair like that in the drawer"". I'll be in touch God willing. Padraig


 Hi Lyn, Glad you decided to rest and see the doctor. I hope you aren't slipping backward Lyn. Sometimes we just have to rest. You and your family are in my prayers sis. Blessings!


 Sis .Was told by Doc am in severe depression..DUH lol.........He put me on Effexor but am leary about it .......Really having rough time with Dad I dont know what is up with him but I am taking him to Doc's today........I also told the doc I have you and others to talk to when I get really down ,he has visited this site and believes it to be a great place .....Will call over the wknd....Love and Huggs..........God Bless.......Sis


 I can surely relate Padraig.......Thanks for you email I will get back to you am not feeling to good last couple of days ...I believe it is all catching up with me ......take care and a gentle hugg for you and your wife ....God Bless......Lyn


 Padraig .....just take a step back and think of someone else being you and doing what you are doing and being the way you are ...You will see my friend you deserve much love and huggs ......My family is not big on hugging and emotional showing but I do tell Cait at least once daily (no doubt many more times lol) that I love her and I am so proud of her.........she is hugged constantly......Here is another gentle hugg for you and Jean.......your happiness and love for one another is just so inspiring,,,,,,,,God Bless........Lyn


 I worked many years in NH,& know how bad they can be.There are good ones out there,but are a rarity.I was diagnosed with AD nearly 9 yrs.ago,being caused from being beaten in the head for 7 yrs.by a former spouse(if you could call him that).I tried many times to get away but was always caught & beaten.Long story short & i finally called his bluff & got away.I told the man I'm married to now to keep me at home if at all possible.I just hope I can stay as good as I am now,later on,& not cause him alot of problems,like fighting,ranting,whatever else that could go on,lol.


 Thank you for your intrest. I'm finding using the internet for the first time trying. I will never let my wife be parted from me again. I am also not perpared to let anyone get involved in caring for her so long as I can. She sleeps a lot now which gives me time to do my 3 1/2mile run each morning and snatch time to write my story. I have achived many goals in my life, but this caring for my wife is giving me the most happiness.


 Thanks Lyn, for your words of comfort. I am avery lucky man you see my lovley wife took me on over fifty years ago. I was nothing more than a stray, released from an Industrial School for boys at 16. I always wondered why I was locked away as a child. This year I have at last discovered,under the Irish freedom of information act. Documents show I was charged in court with begging in 1934, I was two years old! Put to work as a ten year old. My journey in life has been strange, fun, tragic and exciting having travelled the world. My wife has been the best thing that ever happened to me. She changed an emotional barren stray into a loving caring person. With Alzhiemer's she's has not spoken in years but still knows me. I refuse to keep her in doors. Strapping her in a wheelchair at the legs and waist I take her out shopping. The 24th. Sep 05 was our 50th ann. as I knelt down to strap her in I proposed to her asking if she would take me on all over again? I was stunned to hear her rasping reply ""yes"". What a treasure. ---------------------------- Padraig


 Hey Charlie, Nice to meet you sir!! I really enjoyed your posts. They sound like a book I read recently. The name of it is ""The Notebook"". It is a story of a man caring for his wife who has AD and he actually moved into the nursing home with her, so that he could continue to care for her. This has also been made into a movie, but the book was better. I listen to books on tape while I am cleaning, cooking, sewing or driving. It is a great diversion and I tend to get more done. My dad has Alzheimer's and mom cares for him at home. She hope to care for him until the end. Quite an undertaking. I have the utmost respect for you, Lyn and my mom . . . all the folks who dedicate their lives to care for their loved ones who are ill. Welcome to the forum Charlie!! Blessings!


 Hi Lyn, Note you say you lost your Mom, you just look in the mirror, and hug yourself, you are one of the same person. I tell my kids and Grandkids their Mom and Gran will be with them all their lives as some are the image of her when young. When I look at her I see the lovley young girl I married. The body shows signs of wear. When I wake her up for evening meals she appears to try to sit up. Helping her up she looks over my shoulder, seeing someone or something. I gently ask her ""Is it Mom, Dad, some one nice?"" Her expression speaks volumes. Ten days ago her face was a picture of sheer fright. Her breathing stopped she turned blue, I called an ambulance. Rushed her to A&E her cloths cut off, she was masked and wired up. Doctor advised he was not going to reventilate if her breathing stopped again. Two days later she came around I informed the doctor in charge I was taking her home. I reminded him, three years earlied the same hospital gave her little chances of survival. They failed to discoved the cause of the problem. I expressed my reasoning, she was visited by vision from the past that sent her into shock. Such a memory would be the sight of our 15yr old daughter laying dead on the roadside, hit by a car. She is now recovered and doing very well at home. I was lost for those few days, only one to cook for. Now I am more aware how lucky I am having her all to myself to spoil. There must be many people who might like to know how I manage everything for my wife when her body is as stiff as a board, like feeding when she would not eat in hospital, nor more than three years ago in the nursing home, untill I took over. Must snatch time to craft my very strange life's story. Remember to take lifes negatives and positives, without both you will not experience the warm light of contentment. In spite of my lack of formal education I was able to retire at 54yrs age. I still find writing hard work! Good luck and God Bless Padraig.


 Padraig..I certainly concur with Rosie you are so sweet and for sure one in a million....yes I lost Mom last month on March 20th ....three days after St.Paddy""s day in which was a hard time as well as I had lost my first hubby on that day in 1979 ...Dad and Rick always celebrated that day together and they did agian that day ....We got a call at 7 pm that night that Rick had been in a car accident and died instantly........My Dad was as you are with your wife and I went down to look after them both he is slipping away and I think it is because he has lost Mom and doesnt really know what to do with self .alone in a big house full of memories .......I can picture you with your wife I saw the love between my Mom and Dad and it was a love I have never seen before ......Or heard the likings to really except for Rosie's Mom for her Dad.......and her love of her family and parents ... It is so true that when I look in the mirror I see Mom and I also see her in my daughter Cait .....She will forever live on You are the only one as far as I am concerned that REALLY KNOWS your beautiful wife not these Doc's and as for not resucitating ..unless there is a DNR they have to do it .I just went thru it with Mom .......At the end she was just tired of fighting this all and gave up ...She lived a fulfilled life with great great grand babes and all as well she had a hubby much like you......I am truly grateful that HE has sent you to us I truly believe He did ......You have made us here all feel great knowing there are Men / and women out there that really will stick by their Vows and thats a hard thing to find in this day and age......The ones on this board know what I am saying...Thank you for being the wonderful husband and human being you are.....We look forward to your daily posts ........ I have also lost a child so I can honestly say I know this does affect us in so many ways Please keep us posted and you also take care of you ......God Bless You and Give You Strength to keep going and keep these Docs on their toes .they will surely learn a lot from you ........Til the next time ........Lyn BTW ...My email and other info is under name if you want to contact me


 Tomorrow sounds great Lyn. We'll have the second meeting of ""The Mutual Admiration Society"" LOL. Blessings!


 Padraig ....How are you and your wife doing .......Thinking about you .....God Bless.....Lyn


 Sweet, sweet man! That is a touching story sir!! Glad you shared it. Blessings!


 Padraig....I know you will be an asset and a blessing to this forum....you have walked the walk and you are living your vows to the fullest .I have the utmost admiration and respect for you ........I am so touched by your stories and I look forward to them daily.It proves there are peeps out there like you that will go to the farthest lengths for their loved ones .......Thanks for sharing and PLEASE do keep posting ..Give your wife a gentle hugg from us all ......Lots of huggs and God Bless...Lyn


 Hi Lyn, Took wife out shopping this morn. I like to watch her eyes as she looks at children and women. At the check-out she was watching the girl. I said ""She is trying to search something about you"". The check-out girl said: ""I know of her from my mom who worked with her years ago!"" Two statments Jean made in her early stages of AD, I took on board. One when I tried to take her to visit a day centre for people with AD. It was a party day. At the entrance she refused to come in with me, even with coaxing from the with lady with whom I arranged the visit. We managed to get her to have tea in the garden. As we left I questioned why she was so very upset, telling her I had never seen her so. Her reply will forever pain me: ""Your'er trying to put me away"". Imagine the fear of these poor afflicted souls, fearing the day they are put away. I said at the time: ""Never, what would do without you, sit on the lawn like a dog waiting for you"". But I did do it, I have to live with that. The other thing she told me when trying to tell me something: ""The words won't come out properly."" Is it any wonder some people get agitated when they know what they want but the words won't form. Padraig. May your God go with you.


 Hi Lyn, So sorry to learn you are going through a rough patch, you will be in my prayers to-night. Life is great with Jean and I, I always try to live in the present. I can't change the past, but learn from it. The future is the unknown, if it becomes the present I am thankful. The present is the only thing that is real. Rosie, Thank you for your kind words, I don't know if I have never been spoken of in the terms you express. I must have never shaken off the abandoned stray that is part of me. I know people hug and kiss family members. It's not something I can do, once my children and grandchildren became old enough I never feel I have a right to. One or two of the grand daughters hug and kiss me even though they are over 20 it feels wonderful. Our daughter I adore never hugs me, I am sure she understands me. It comes from the lack of having anyone to turn to, being raised In Industrial Schools. There are so many advantages and blessings from it. My wife won me over a long time ago and like any abused stray I remain loyal and derive great pleasure tending to her every need. I am not being ungrateful I find it hard to accept kindness. May your God go with you. Padraig."
My mother is sick and I'm lost,"Hello msnancy. I am sorry to hear about the problems that your mom is having. I would suggest that you go with your mom to the Doctor. Explain your concerns and then the Doctor will probably arrange an asessment for your Mom. She will be asked a list of questions and that will help the Doctor decide what to do next. My sister is in her fifties and she has Alzheimers. She only scored 9 points at her last asessment and 13 a year before that. I think the most that can be scored is somthing like 30. If you think that it might upset your Mom to suggest to her that you feel that she needs to see the Doctor because of her memory problems,maybe you could tell her its to get a routine blood pressure check. Or if she is on medication for any other condition you could say ""we are going to get your meds reviewed Mom"" It doesnt have to be a lie because you could get that done at the same time. I hope that helps.","Get some books, simple ones at first, some are too medically technical and what you'll need is about caregiving by other caregivers. Take her to a neurologist as Snowy says, it may not be AD, but if it is, the sooner she's on meds, the better. You may only get a diagnosis of 'probable' Alzheimer's, about 85% accurate. It's only 100% when a biopsy is done. It is important to remember to take care of yourself, your children and spouse. They often get lost in the caregiving routine. You may not be thinking about it now, but if not already done, get financial and health directives in order NOW. Get an Elder Care atty if you don't have an atty already. Get info at local senior center. Good luck & keep posting.


 Thank you so much to everyone who has provided me with all this great advice. I really appreciate all the support. I was planning on taking my mother to a neurologist and will definitely follow through on those plans, even if she constantly insists that she is perfectly healthy. Thanks again!


 I have heard feedback from others about senior day cares and I am really fond of the idea. I of course would have to tell my mother she would be volunteering in order to get her there, but at least this would keep her active. I know this sounds kind of stupid, but I am concerned that if I don't keep her mind stimulated, her illness will progress even faster. Kind of like the old saying""if you don't use it, you lose it.""


 How are you doing and how are the plans for the volunteering going .........Let me know will ya ............Take care


 Nance yes I think Silence is a better response than NO lol......She would love it I bet........does she do knitting or crocheting, that could be a good start ask her if she would like to show others how to do it .........Wishing you all the best and will wait for that email ........God Bless....Lyn


 Maybe not they will do that here at the respite centres and it would be great if she could show some simple recipes ..she would feel as though she was contributing and I think that is a good thing ......Got your Email ...going to check it out thanks ......Take care and God Bless...Lyn


 CrazyLinda.......Hi and Welcome to HW ..you will find plenty of support and great peeps on this site.......Thanks for your input....BTW...could I ask you to take caps off as it makes it look as though you are yelling lol..thanks .I know I have done this by accident and had to redo lol...Hope to see you post often ,...God Bless...Lyn


 Nance how are ya worried as I havent heard from you .....God Bless......Lyn


 I am so HAPPY for you and your mum .stick to your guns you are doing the right thing IMO.......happy Mother's Day to her and give her and self a gentle hugg ...glad to hear you had some discussions .........God Bless and keep me posted will you .....Lyn


 Hi Lyn- Things are fine, which is better that bad i guess. We have a family party this weekend which I am debating on whether or not we should go. My mom seems to get anxious when there are a lot of people and gets confused easily. Do you have any big plans for the weekend?


 Hi Lyn- So the weekend wasnt as bad as i predicted it would be. i haven't replied to any of Padraigs posts but I definielty will. Seems liek he may have some good advice. take care nance


 Hey everyone! My name is Nancy and I'm new to this forum so I thought I'd go ahead and introduce myself. I'm a mother of two and just recently began caring for own mother. Things have changed so drastically in the past year for her, mostly her health. She has slowly started to forget things and I fear more than anything that it could ultimately be the being of Alzheimers. It started out with family birthdays, but has now escalated to conversations from an hour earlier. I've never dealt with anything remotely close to this, so I am lost at this point. If anyone has any advice, helpful suggestions, I'm all ears..


 She needs to be seen by a Neurologist for testing.If she has Alzheimer' s she will be put on medication.There are several medications Aricept,Exelon,Razadyne,& Namenda.There is no cure,but the meds,do slow it down..................


 Hi and Welcome Nancy.......I was the caregiver for Mom ,sadly she passed away on the 20th of March. I am still looking after my step Dad and he also has gotten pretty bad lately ,I think alot has to do with losing his world basically.. In the corner there is a yellow box with resources click on that and it will get you to some places for starters. Definitely she does need a neurolgist,and you will also need some support for you,as the caregiver.I am bumping a few things up for you and hopefully it will help to read up on them.As well Alzinfo.Org, may have some input for you There is a lot of great support and peeps on this forum and you can come here to vent,cry,laugh or just share your day with us and we will try to help you in any way possible. I am so glad you have found us and we shall be looking for more posts from you .Please do look after yourself as well the others as you can and will get run down pretty quick if you are not looking out for you as well .If you need to talk all my info is there I am here as well as the others for you.You are no longer alone with this.May I say I am glad to see you are looking after your Mom the memories you have from the past and the new ones you will make (even with her memory loss) will be the best ever,my hat goes off to you for stepping up to the plate for your Mom she is lucky to have you as her daughter ......take care and God Bless.....Lyn Others have given great input as well ....


 Please keep us posted as well after Mom sees the neuroligist. As snowy has said there are many good meds out there to help with the progression(slowing)down of AD......You are a special Lady ....read a ""Message To Send"" by Padraig and he has some great input and helpful tech's to lend anyone . Take care of you as well I know I just keep saying that BUT you hav to be well in order to look after your Mom and all the rest of your family....Take care and GOd Bless............Lyn


 IMO It would be a great idea for her and she would be volunteering kinda she could show some of the worse off some things I am sure ,and she would really love the company.When Mom was alive we had a monthly clothing share and food bank she just loved to be involved in.I believe keeping her busy is a good idea ..read some of Charlie's stories with his wife .He is looking after her after she just about did die in a home he took her out and looks after her ....God Bless...Lyn


 Hi Lyn- I'm doing well, thanks. I mentioned something to my Claire, my mother, about volunteering a couple days out of the week and I received silence. So I guess that's better than a no. I am planning on bringing it up again this weekend hoping that she will actually respond to the thought. Have you heard of mindfit before? someone mentioned it in the health boards forums. It's suppose to help with memory . I signed up for their newsletter, and i received this email: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . Nance.........Could you just email me that info please I am not sure if it is appropriate to post that email on here ........Hope you understand and I am looking forward to getting it ...Be well and God Bless.Lyn I think i'm going to try it, i'll let you know what i think. Or I could just forward this email to you. Take care Nance Post Edited By Moderator (Lyn (Howlyncat)) : 5/10/2006 5:05:51 AM (GMT-6)


 HI Lyn- I'm sorry. I didn't think it would be a problem but I do understand. I can just forward the email to you if you'd like. She's not much of a knitter but she does love to cook. She is an amazing cook so maybe she could show others some simple recipes but I feel like that might be a little far fetched.


 HI NANCY MY DAD HAD ALZHIEMER'S AND WE TOLD DAD HE WAS A VOLUNTEER IT WORKED FOR DAD. HE WAS TOLD HE HAD AD AT 58 YEARS OLD .


 Nance how are things going .Hope you have a great Mother's Day with your Mom and you too of course........God Bless......Lyn


 Hi Lyn- Sorry I have been out of town! Happy Belated Mothers Day. We went to my sisters for the weekend so we could all spend mothers day with my mother. My sister and I had a long discussion on my decision to have my mother live with me. She completly disagrees and thinks we should put her in a home! can you believe it! That will never happen. We have received the test results and my mother has not been diagnosed with AD, thank you lord! it turns out her issues are coming with age so I'm taking baby steps to get her help that she needs. I enrolled her in a senior daycare program which starts next week so that's a start. I am thinking about getting that program i was telling you about . I used the download code they sent me and the program was really interesting. Defenitly something that I think my motehr adn I could do together. Enough about me, how was your mothers day?? -nance

Hello Lyn and All,"Hi Lyn, I haven't been on the forum for months, but I wanted to touch base and say hello to you and the others. Dad has really gotten much worse and we have been dealing with huge hygiene issues and his agressiveness and refusal to allow us to clean him up or change him (pew). He is still very strong, but will swat at you and put up his fist and grab your wrist and squeeze. Mom has been a saint! I know if he were in the hospital they would just knock him out with drugs and change him and bathe him. Well, finally we got someone to listen and the doctor is putting him in the hospital psyc ward for an evaluation and med trial. They will keep him long enought to get the new meds adjusted in an attempt to lower the aggressiveness and to help him sleep through the night so mom can get some sleep too. Hopefully this will go a long way in us being able to care for him at home. I continue to spend two or three days each week and I am just thrilled when I can accomplish any little hygiene task with him. Never thought I 'd be so happy to clean accomplish so little. I hope you are doing well me sweet sister, Lyn. Love you lots!!! Haven't been on-line because I have actually been feeling semi-normal and am able to do more and more. I hope your health has improved as well. Last I knew you were have a pretty rough time of it. I'd love an update. Hugs and Blessings!","bump

Mother refusing meds,"My mother has been diagnosed with glaucoma and requires surgery. The surgery has been postponed indefinately until her blood pressure can be stablized. She's been give two different meds for this but has dropped one because she didn't like the way it made her feel. Her pressure has been at stroke level for ages. She refuses to call the dr. or even give me his name. Today she complained about her ears ringing all day. obviously theres an issue here and I feel like my hands are tied. The family still will give me no support in this. In addition to going off her med, now she's spending time telling my children about the little girl (I don't remember what state) that was killed by a bear. Whatever details the media didn't give my mother just made up and made this as gruesome as possible for my children. The 8 and 6 year olds both looked horrified. When I realized what she was doing and came rushing out of the kitchen to stop her she became very defensive and accused me of not only not facing reality but refusing to allow my children to grow up. I know this is just part of her slipping away, and it's devastating to see, but how do I continue to expose my children to her? Granted the two grown girls and the 14 year old can deal with this, but the 8, 6, and 2 year olds can't really be expected to. I guess I'm just venting, there really doesn't seem to be any solution to this. Ellie","Mother finally got her blood pressure down to a managable level and had her eye surgery last week. Glaucoma surgery and cataract surgery at the same time she tells me. She didn't tell me the surgery date. I guess they kept cancelling it due to her BP so she just figured when she went in they would cancel it again. All went well but now they have her putting drops in her eyes every two hours? Plus another kind every four, and I think theres a third drop she does twice a day. So far she's keeping track by keeping it all on paper but this is a woman who can't remember her phone # or grandkids names. I'm afraid she's going to get confused. She won't come here. Says my cat will frighten hers. Good grief. Her cat has a heart condition and I understand her fears. Now she's saying since she had her surgery she won't need the bp meds anymore. That the only reason she worried about it was so she could get her eyes fixed and she ""did very nicely without it before, thank you"". I'm going to go crazy. Ok, crazier. What do you do when they start to act like defiant little children? She still won't give me her dr.s name because she knows I""ll call him. Mostly just venting here. Thanks for reading my little novella if you made it this far. Take care Ellie


 I think sometimes she does tell me these things just to rattle my cage. She knows I worry and I think she takes some comfort there. I wish she'd just come here and I could help her for a week or so. Not forever, we'd do each other in, but just until the worst of this eye thing were over. In addition to all her med's she's trying to remember her cat's ear drops (hope they don't end up in moms eyes), it has and infection plus the cat is on a diuretic (sp?) and heart medicine. If she mixes those up it could be a real mess. She has a friend that takes her to the dr. but she doesn't see her everyday. I guess sometimes theres nothing to do but worry. She won't let anyone help. And YES she is terrified of being old. She'll be 79 this month and refuses to have anything to do with people her own age. Says they're all old and she's not. I must admit that she walks miles each day. Except for the eyes and BP she is in excellent shape. It's such a shame that her body is holding up so well and her mind is slowly slipping away. Thanks for the reply Lyn, you have a good day hon. Hope your dad is doing well. Take care Ellie


 Ellie hun so sorry I just got up a long day with all the family and at Mom's to boot......Anyways hun I think you have to talk to your mom and tell her that coming off those meds can really cause some damage for instance the ringing in the ears is not good .....I know she is slipping but she is still able to know right from wrong right? If this is the cause then ask her not to talk to the lil ones about these types of current events as YOU have your way to talk to them about it and it may not be the way she does .....and they get scared easy.......I had to go thru this with Mom a few times in the early stages but she did stop talking about things to Cait it was as if she had no one else to listen so she would tell cait all kinds of weird and sometimes gorry things .......Vent all you want I know you do deserve to do that my dear .....I am thinking bout ya .......God Bless and I am sure others will be along as welll..Lyn


 Ellie ....it is hard to think of your mom as a child but at some stage of AD she does revert back to a stubborn one or may well do ........I think she is scared really getting older hearing of peeps getting this DD and herself worrying she is getting it ......bear with her I know it is so dang frustrating at times but it something you will have to adjust to for now .....she is trying to keep her independance I am sure ...MOm use to get me into such a tizzy at times but she knew she could so thats why she did it .....if your mom is writing things down I think she kinda knows something is going in her memory dept .........just kinda keep an eye on her undirectly and I am sure she will be fine you dont need to be sick over all of this ....Let me know how you both are doing please......God Bless....Lyn


 Ellie I hope the drops dont get mixed as well that would be really not good ....and your Mom is washing hands after doing cats eyes right .....I ask this s Cait ended up with the nastiest infection from cleaning the guck out of her cats eyes and thats what it was from....Hon you will worry yourself sick you know that she is okay right now she will come to you I really think when she knows it is time ........My mom was the most stubborn and I will never forget""our talk"" and how she broke down about losing her memory and forgetting peeps it was heartbreaking BUT she did talk about it ........I will be keeping you and her in my thoughts heart and Prayers.......God Bless,,,,,,Dad is not doing to bad yet not good either kinda in a stand still he thought I was Mom the other night .......really freaked me out ....you really need to look after you to hun please........Lyn"
Medical care for aunt with alzheimer's,"The nursing home just called and told me that my aunt had a chest xray today and they found a mass on her lungs. They wanted to know if we wanted to have a CAT scan, recommended by the doctor. We are waiting for one to be scheduled. My question is, if it is lung cancer, she is a non smoker who has had cronic broncitis for over 40 years, what experience if any do you guys have with treating someone with alzheimers? She fights mosts meds, can't imaging her with an IV, doesn't stay in bed, but wanders into rooms and down the halls. I just don't want her to be in pain. So it would seem like a morphine pump would be out because she would pull it out. May be a patch. My mother died from lung cancer and I know how painful it is. Do you think my aunt who is middle end stage alzheimers can communicate pain? I know her knee hurts alot but she'll tell me it doesn't. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks - Judy K","Kent would you possibly be into Reiki??? I ask this because of your sign off ........Take care and God Bless.........


 Hi Judy and Welcome ........I am really sorry about your Mom i just lost mine in March this yr ...from COPD,Psorasis(sp) and she suffered from Alzheimer's as well ......I believe my mom felt pain I could see it in her eyes .....the patch might be your only option right now........do they have her on meds to calm her dowm at all? I looked after Mom at home (her house) as I had promised her yrs ago I would not put her into a home but I do understand that it is sometimes the only thing you are able to do ..There are quite a few peeps on here that I am sure will gladly give you some input for your post..........Where are you from?? I know here in Canada we can put them in a chair with a posey bar to help them from wandering ...........it has to be a legal restraint and approved by the doc ........I am sure others will be along ..in the meantime go thru some of the old threads and see what you find in there .....also the HW Resources at the side are good for info too...Please post and let us know how things are going ........Take care and God Bles............Lyn....Meds can be put in jam or jello or something of the sorts.....Other members may have some more sugggesstions BTW.........when I saw this post it at first stunned me.........

i'm new to this...i need advise,"hello to all i am trying to cope with the everyday struggles of caring for my 76 yoa mother who is now in the advanced stages of alzheimers. my brother whom i have had an off and on again relationship has put our mother in a nh, he is the poa myself and my family(my husband and 3 daughters) have been caring for her for the last 5 years.well recently she fell, while attempting to pick something up from the floor, and broke her pelvic bone in 2 places.of course we called ems and she was taken to the hospital and we were told she would need about 16 weeks of therapy to help her heal. without even talking to me , he decides to put her in the nh, she has been there for about 10 weeks now, she is miserable,often agitated with everyone,she begs me to take her home. ii have asked my brother to pleases let her come back and get in home help for her , he of course says no, this is not fair,my mother raised me, and taught me to be a loving, caring adult, its my turn now to take care of her now my whole family is upset.... we don't know what to do please if you have any ideas,opinions...anything","so i pretty much sol... i kinda of figured about that much, with my mother being in the middle stages of alz, can getting the poa changed be legal?


 Hi Teresa and Welcome ......I am so sorry about all you are going thru ....recently after looking after my Mom for yrs just myself and daughter (ex as well) my younger sister decided to go to Mom's and paint and take down wallpaper after Mom had been sent home with a mild caes of pneumonia.........well needless to say this made her much sicker she went to hospital and was quite adament she could smell mold and I believed her....anyways to make a long story short My mom was intubated on March 19th ,air lifted to London Ontario and passed away on March 20 at 6:30 in the morning ........there was no POA and the only thing I had done up was a paper (notarized) saying I would never let her go into NH........I was not notified in time to be with Mom when she went I got there after her death and the sister and younger brother with my step dad (also has AD) had been talked to by a social worker and THEY decided to donate Mom's body for research......... As you can well imagine I was and still am highly upset over all of this and it has really caused some bad feelings amongst the siblings ......They were never there for her when she was alive and I took care of her with all my ilnesses and had my daughter and ex help me ........Dad is the one now we look after and this is her (sister's) Bio dad my step dad BUT again they (none of them) do anything for him unless they want money or something then they are there.......it makes me sick ........so yes I can and do relate to this whole thing you are going thru I have a suggesstion and I dont know where you live but in Ontario it is allowed.....I have written and had my minister write and other peeps about the fact that I looked after her and am looking after Dad not any of the other family and I did it out of love not for any other reason or compensation as I am sure you do......to the Lawyer and now I am POA for Dad and I will make sure all is on the up and up anfd follow his wishes to the letter....anyways I have proven that I was the primary caregiver for Mom and Dad and now I am fighting this about her body being kept in the Hospital (til students return to study) because I will not have her ashes til sometime next yr ..this leaves me no closure and all kinds of heartfelt pain......now I believe that yes AD needs more research but they are doing this this way as it is cheaper and to study alcohol effects ( heavy drinker til last yr) and COPD, Emphysema and she also had cancer ...... Is it possible for you do do as I did and have peeps verify that you and your family were the ones that did her caregivig.....Not the brother......I dont know if this would be possible but I am praying this can be changed for you and you can have her home with you where she will obviously be taken care of and given plenty of love.......I am sorry for the ramble but I am sure you can see that I am still very hurt and angery over all of what had taken place.........If you would like to talk my email and other infois under name please do get ahold of me I am here for you and I am able to understand really.... I am praying for you and your Mom, you's are in my thoughts please get in touch and hey thanks for letting me ramble and get this off my chest........Please keep coming here and posting you will find lots of empathy and support here on HW......God Bless...... BTW if you have the means I would go for the Guardian ship as Snowy had posted about


 Unless your Mom changes the POA ther's not much you can do.


 No.Unless you go for gaudianship,& that's expensive.


 Teresa..........Just wondering how you are doing ........"
Mother hit by car this morning!,"I think this is just the final straw. In addition to not looking where she's going, her decision making abilities are at an all time low. I dodn't think I've ever been so frustrated. She was hit by a stolen vehicle (officer witnessed the incident), thrown up on the hood of the car, slid off the side and hit the ground. The car (actually I think it was a truck) never stopped. Just kept right on going. The officer on the scene said it appeared to be intentional. He called the paramedics out. They check her out, find no immediate serious injuries and proceed to get ready to transport her to have her checked out at the hospital (she's 79 for heavens sake) and she balks. Refuses to be transported. Now she has medicaid. She pays nothing for med. bills. This was not a financial issue. She just didn't want to go. Couldn't leave the da*n cat that long. I'm not just worried, I'm ticked off. I asked her if the roles had been reversed and it had been me in the accident what her reaction would have been. What if she's bleeding internally? I told her she could be and that she might not wake up in the morning if she doesn't get it checked out. Told her I'd come take her right now, she still refused. At the very least she's going to hurt so bad she won't be able to get out of bed tomorrow. I'm at a loss here. She tells me this stuff so I'll worry and then wont let me do anything to fix it. AAAAAAAArrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhh!","Ellie ......OMG I am so sorry I have not been here today just saw this now .....I will get on MSN with you after a bit okay when I am done at the Church.......Dam* I feel so bad for not being here for you .......LOve sis


 She called me back last night. I guess she'd called the ambulance back and had them come out. Changed her mind because her wrist was swelling. They told her that since she had refused the first time, her insurance would not pay for this trip because now it was just a swollen wrist. She'd be billed 300+. So of course once again she refuses to go, (bet they bill her for the trip out anyway) and calls me. I was in the middle of my T appt and didn't even look at the phone til I left. By the time I got her on the phone, (her line was busy for almost 90 min.) I had to leave to get my daughter to her cheer dress rehearsal. I told her I could drop the girl off and have her get a ride home and come out and take her, but no, she says she'll wait till tomorrow. I tried to call her when I got home but it was nine and she never hears the phone when she's sleeping. Sure hope thats all. I haven't tried yet this morning. It's just now seven here and I'm sure that even though she talks about how she gets up early, if I call I""ll wake her. She's going to be terribly sore this morning. With any luck my aunt took her in last night. She only lives two blocks away. She still drives all over the place. Not sure why she can't do something for mom.


 Hi Mrs. Mac Well, she called me at 8:30 this am and said she needed to go, but once I got my schedule all juggled and everything arranged, she changed her mind again. She told me the swelling had gone down some and it was feeling better. I don't know what's going on. I think I'm going to go out tomorrow afternoon and see for myself just the same. I'm not going to be okay with this until I do. It may very well be just a sprain, and I'm fairly certain internal bleeding would have made itself evident by now, but I need to look at the arm and make sure it really isn't a big deal. If it looks broken I may have to toss the stubborn woman over my shoulder and carry her to the van caveman style, lol. She's all of 4' 10"" and I may not be a whole lot taller, but I've got a couple of inches on her, and I could do it. Thanks for asking Ellie


 SIS ......There very well could be internal bleeding .......I am almost positive your Mom has Demetia.......I am really surprised with the attendants attitude that came last night ....300.00 for an ambulance trip that is outrageous it cost us 28.00 here for that same thing ......... AS for your other family members ya right, they sound just like mine do and were while Mom was alive and now with Dad unless they want something from him or wanted her to do something or give them money..they didnt help out at all ..........only Cait and I did and do ....... I feel they know you will .............just as mine do .... I was so hoping that because of this an assessment would have been done .....maybe when and if you can get her to doc's or hospital I would really push for one ....write down things she is doing her mood swings her anger,frustration ...everything you can possibly think of I am so sorry you have to deal with this ...I truly understand and know what you are feeling right now and have been for some time ......... I had to talk to cait about some issues today so we went out for the day sorry I havent been here for you ......I want you to know that I do care hun honestly and I am WORRIED sick about you .......I will call you if you want to email me your number so we can talk ..I will not repeat to any one you have my word.........God Bless sis and Luvs ya


 It may have to come to that and I dont think she hates you .........I really dont ............Please email me for sure I will check in later.....talk about Soul sista's lol..........I am forever doing something with th teens here too lol.........Good Luck sis


 hwy ellie, i do hope that it all works out ok for you and your mum!! i wish i could offer you more advice, but seeing as i am in the uk, am not sure about how you guys go about things over there!!! good luck and my thoughts are with you all just now sandra xxx

 Sending prayers. God bless.


 oh ellie poor you!!! i'm at a loss of what to say you, you must be so worried, frustrated, angry, upset, and probably have many more emotions running through your head just now!!! i hope your mum does hurt in the morning and maybe then you can persuade her to seek some medical attention!!! keep on at her!!! let us know how she is!!! sandra xxxx and some extra hugs to you (((((((((((ellie)))))))))))))))

 hi ellie how are things honey????


 lol good luck ellie, hope she's ok, let us know how things go sandra xxxxxx


 You're such a sweetheart Lyn, I'll e-mail you later. I have a houseful of teens waiting for me to drop them at the theatre to see some silly cartoon cow movie? Barnyard? Go figure. Mom insists she's okay. I'll see tomorrow. My aunt made her call me as soon as it happened. Of course, she didn't want to be responsible for mom in any way. Oh, you have no idea how mad that makes me. But when someone else offered to drive her this morning, so I wouldn't have to come out with all the kids, she said she didn't like him,(her nephew) and wouldn't go. I'm going to call her back in a little bit, and if she isn't considerably improved I'm going out anyway, and make her go. If it comes down to calling the police and telling them she's incompetent. I won't just let her sit there and die. She can hate me all she wants. She does anyway. E-mail you later. Ellie


 I am so Hoping that SnowyLynne will post as she has a lot of knowledge about this kind of stuff ........


 You are a sweetie Sandra......


 I'm told that as long as she is paying her own bills and caring for herself physically, that there is nothing I can do. I guess she has to do something like burning the house down before I can force her to go to the dr. and get checked out in this state. She's run up thousands on her credit cards taking care of stray cats. (She takes them to the vets and has them neutered and gets their shots) A noble endeavor, if you aren't half starving yourself to do it. She lives on her Social Security. Almost nothing. And I can't help her financially. She's taken her cat to three different vet's in the last week. She imagines health issues, takes it to the vets, sometimes they give her the meds for the animal, but by the next day she won't use it, and off she goes to yet a different vet. I told her yesterday, that I would not help her kill her cat by taking it to the vet every other day. I will take my mother to the dr., the store, or anywhere else she needs to go, but not to the da*n vet. I""m trying so hard to be patient. But she won't let me help her. And the system won't help her. I am frustrated beyond belief. Don't sound like much of a daughter do I? I call her every day to check on her but I dread picking up that phone. The negativity on the other end of the line is endless. Okay enough of my vent. Ellie


 BUMP


 Sis how is she doing .......and you of course....."
Mother seems to be resigned to passing away,"Ellie I am so sorry my sis ......I honestly do know how you feel and what you are going thru ....Mom was like this prior to her passing and now my dad is literally hiding out in the den in the big house ( den was only rom Mom never went in ) ......only time he seems a shadow of former self is when I take him yard saling and to the wednesday market ....I really think he will pass waay from a broken heart ,they were together for 40 yrs .......Your Mom is alot older than mine was went she went .It could also be that she feels she is a burden on you and I know you to well to even think you would feel that way about her .......I know how much you love her hun ........You are doing all the right things she has to want to be here ya know ....Please email me and we shall talk in greater length or I will call you ( no I am not an axe murderer lol or weirdo as you know ) I only worry about you .......Take care sis and DONT beat self up over this please......Luvs ya ......Lyn.....you are doing all you can","My health is kinda under control lol...........I would like to tlk with you so I do hope you get ahold of me I wasnt on all day yesterday ........at the hospital and then slept .Am going to my own doc am tired of the nurses not listening to me about what vein can and will work ya know .....Sis I am truly sorry you are going thru this and I dont want you to go thru it alone .......lots of love and God Bless....Lyn


 Sorry Lyn, My ex-husband was in town all week and staying at the house. My oldest daughter was still in town as well and acts much differently around her father. Big meltdown on the fourth, won't go into details here but I hadn't been able to spend as much time on the forum as I would have liked. Mom is mostly the same. I've finally put my finger on what's so different though. She's not complaining or talking badly about people like she's always done. Not AT ALL. Now you would think this is a good thing but somehow this alarms me. This ""quietness"" about her is settling in and is unnatural. I feel this sudden need to spend as much time with her as possible. That perhaps we are nearing the end of the road. I can't get out there as much as I'd like but I've spent alot of time on the phone with her. Hopefully I can pick her up tomorrow and bring her over for dinner and then my husband can take her back when he goes home to his parents house. My daughter has cheer practice for the next two weeks and I won't be able to make it out there at all then. Thanks for caring Lyn. My mom has a wonderful friend who gets her to most of her dr. appts. but when it comes to all her emotional stuff, I feel very isolated. She doesn't see her friend often and the rest of the family has just ignored her when she really needs help. Thanks again hon. I'll let you know what they say after her appt on wed. Take Care Ellie


 Ellie good to hear from you today hopefully I have given you some help........we can yak tomorrow when I get back from Doc;s ......Luv ya ,,,Lyn


 Mom had her Opthamologist (sp) appt. this morning. They took out the third stitch in her eye and say that her glaucoma/cataract surgery was a success. She's still being watched closely and will need surgery on the other eye but for the time being at least thats better. Odd though, she called me very confused. It was like she was in a fog and after a few moments she seemed more herself but insisted I woke her when I called and thats why she was so mixed up. Hmmmm..........She called me. Actually she woke ME up. It's impossible to nap in this house anyway. My 2 year old kept prying my eyelids open asking, ""whatcha doin mommy?"" She really did think I called her though. It was weird when I answered the phone because she didn't seem to remember who she called or know who she was talking to for a couple of moments. I'm beginning to think she's having mini strokes. She has an appt with her real dr. next week so at least they'll check her BP and get her on some different cholesterol med. She won't take the one they gave her. Insists it makes her sick and perhaps it does. I don't know. She also says taking all these meds makes her feel old and is very resistant to all of them. I guess now it's just wait and see what her GP says. Take Care Ellie


 Oh Ellie I am so sorry you are going thru this and your poor Mom I bet she is so confused ......I use to get those calls all the time until I just finally went with it no sense arguing the fact with Mom.........Sometimes I miss having 2 yr olds running about ,and then others am glad I dont have lol.......I remember those pulling on the eyelids days though awwww it is cute..........can you go to docs with her I know she grips but maybe just tell her so you know in case you have to do something for her .....geez talk about being between a rock and a hard place I am sorry I cant be more help are you on my msn now and if so beep me I always put to busy when I am on .....Talk to you later .love ya ....


 Finally got mom to agree to come over. Picking her up on sunday for the day. Maybe I can figure out more whats going on if I see her in person than I can over the phone. Somethings going on that's for sure. I don't know what I'd do without my little one. Really wish I could have another. She drives me CRAZY, they all do, and I love every minute of it. I don't know what I'll do when they're big. Being a mommy is all I've ever known. May end up taking care of Mom before long though. Ahhh, God wills what he wills. Just have to wait and see. I hope I'm up to the task. Have a good day Ellie


 Hey sis dont forget to let us know how it goes today my thoughts and prayers are with you .........love ya ......


 Well, lyn, she seems weak and tired. I've been worried that she's having small strokes and I have a friend up north thats a CNA that told me to look for even the slightiest droopiness on either side of her face. Her left eye is markedly drooping but thats also the eye she had surgery on so I don't know. I did mention it to her but she said her eye dr. said it was of no importance. I remain unconvinced. Shes still confused. Mixing up the kids with the cats and couldn't fill out her check at the store. I'm learning it's easier on the cashier and less embarassing for mom if I fill it out for her and just have her sign it. Using the excuse of her visual problems helps her save face. She wrote a check for 194.00 when it was supposed to be 100.94. I wonder how often she's done that and been ripped off. She keeps talking about death. Like she's preparing. What she want's everyone to have and all the instructions for her cat, etc. She tells me she feels ill, and tired all the time. Just worn out. That she always puts extra food and water out for the cat at night because she's sure soon she just won't wake up. I want to go to the dr. with her on wed. but 14 yr. old daughter has cheer practice in the morning and I have a T appt in the afternoon. She didn't want me there anyway. Kinda hurts my feelings that she'll let her friend go but doesn't want me there. Oh well, anyway, thats our latest update. She has an appt on Wed with both the opthamologist and her GP so we'll see then. Take Care hon Ellie


 I was impressed with her when she was here. She actually paid attention to my 2 year old. Told everyone the 14 and 6 year old's were her favorite though, and then she said of course the baby too. Shame she makes it so obvious she doesn't care for the 9 year old. He knows it too. It makes me so angry, but I just let it go. I talked to him later and let him know grandma isn't herself anymore and she just forgets to include him sometimes. That she does that to me too, (and she does) I don't think it made him feel any better. When she buys stuff for the other kids and nothing for him, I always get him something and tell him it's from grandma. She always looks confused when he thanks her but I must admit to letting her wonder if she actually did get him something and forgot. I can't argue with her anymore.I feel like I have an unfair advantage. She just really isn't herself now. To her credit she did pay attention to the kids (most of them) and thats really unusual. She usually just sits on the couch and talks about how terrible her life is and how everyone thinks badly of her. I'm trying so hard to make peace with her. I think in her way she's trying too. This just may be as good as it gets. She's 79 Lyn, if she goes tomorrow, I want my concience clear, even if her's isn't. Thanks for caring Ellie


 OMG, she's gonna drive me crazy today! She had a ride with her friend to her dr's appointment. It's 45 minutes from her house. What does she do. She decided's to have a pity party, (I knew there was going to be a problem as soon as she answered the phone, she has a true whine to her voice when she's in that mood) and decided she's too much of a burden to everyone with the rides and such. Told her friend she absolutely would NOT accept a ride to the doctor and is taking the bus. In normal weather conditions this is bad enough, she has to transfer twice to get to the area she needs to be in, but it's supposed to be 105 here today. The hottest day so far this year. Thats real temp. With the heat index it may go as high as 115. She's going to kill herself out there in this heat. I won't even walk to the mailbox. I managed to get that great hulking van of mine in the garage even, it was taking so long to cool off that by the time it did we were home again. Theres nothing I can do about this. I told her my daughters cheer schedule and also that if she could make her appts on days where there was no practice I'd shift everything else on my schedule to take her to the doctor. Nope. Wouldn't hear of it. I wasn't really worried about this appt. as I knew she already had a ride. She cancelled it AFTER she heard the weather report. Mom plays the martyr once again. If she doesn't manage to put herself in the hospital she's going to complain about this forever. In addition I may end up getting calls from the aunts (who won't take her anywhere, one of which is much younger, drives all over the place, and only lives a block from mom) because she'll tell them I wouldn't take her and left her to take the bus. This is typical for mom. Okay, just venting today. It's already started out crazy. Doesn't look good for the rest of the day either. AAAAAaaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhh!!!!!!!!!


 Well, she made it there and back. I called her just as she walked in the door and she sounded like he**. Her pressure is back up, they want to recheck her cholesterol and the pressure is up in her eye as well. They gave her new meds (not that she'll take them) and I told her I'd take her on friday if she hadn't gotten a ride to the pharmacy by then, (I don't know why she won't use the hospital pharmacy) but she say's ""no I'll walk"". I told her that would be fine, but it's supposed to be over a hundred all week and the pharmacy is at least a mile and a half away. Funny just as I was about to ring off she tells me maybe she'll take that ride after all. Score one for me!!!! Ellie


 I don't really know how to explain this, but I'm going to give it a shot. Mom was over for her birthday. She just turned 79. Best visit we've had in years. Oh she's forgetting the kids names etc, but I'm adjusting to that. She seemed vague, like part of her was somewhere else. Not ill, just a shadow of her former self. And I have this terrible feeling that somehow she's just going to fade away. She talks about how she leaves extra food out for her cat at night because she's afraid she'll die in her sleep and the cat will be hungry before someone finds her. Say's she doesn't feel that she'll be around much longer. Do they know sometimes. Or is she giving up. I've been calling her at least once a day to check on her but she doesn't sound right. She just sounds so resigned. Old and tired and finished. I hate this so much, and I can't fix it. Ellie


 I will e-mail you at a later date Lyn. Right now with all that you're going through with your health, I wouldn't even consider troubling you will my problems.

So what do you think about that DanActive (?) commercial?,"Hi, Have you seen that relatively new commercial where the man is reading the newspaper and it says that 60% of our immune system in in our digestive tract? (or maybe it's a higher percentage, I forget) And, his kids are eating Activia (or is it DanActive? I forget) and it's supposed to have in it the same thing that was just discovered to increase immunity? (something like that) Well, it makes me think about how B12 is so complicated to get into our bodies because it has to come in through the digestive tract and there are so many things which can go wrong. I drew a lot of pictures about our digestive tract for my web site, so it's a little easier for me to remember how some of it works. The one picture I still need to draw is of h.pylori which is something that can start growing in our stomachs and then it really interfers with getting any B12 from our food. h.pylori is wiped out by antibiotics, so that's how come some stomach ulcers can be cured by antibiotics. I forget exactly how it works, but it's something like this: once the h.pylori starts growing it shuts down the little things that make stomach acid for us. Without stomach acid we can't get B12 or magnesium out of our food. (maybe other things too, I just pay attention to vitamin B12 and magnesium... and vitamin C and a few others, but not all of them, it's too much for me to try to think about all of them) Okay, so I just read that if we take a small dose of hydrochloric acid everyday, which I think is also called Betaine, then that small amount of ""stomach acid"" is enough to keep the h.pylori from being able to take hold. I think that is amazing. I know that when I had a huge dose of Metronidazol, which is a major antibiotic, for almost a whole month, that it not only got rid of my tetanus, it also must have gotten rid of h.pylori that I had but didn't know about , because after that I stopped having diarrhea as often as before and I didn't have so much undigested food, like corn kernels. Not every one can take the Betaine... certain health problems make it not a good thing to take. I had a health book that I gave away (so I can't check it) that said that people who had been given sulfa drugs were likely to need hydrochloric acid... I don't know if sulfa drugs are still a part of relatively common medicine. I just know that after I had pneumonia a few times when I was a kid and I'd had so much penicillin that I became allergic to it, they had to give me sulfa drugs with the penicillin to counteract it... So that might mean that for decades my ability to get B12 and magnesium out of food was reduced... and so very slowly I was weakening until something happened and it seemed like all of a sudden I was sick. I've been under huge stress for a month or so since a lawyer tried to get it so I wouldn't be able to answer his motion to dismiss. I had filed a motion for summary judgment which I think is really accurate, so he moved to dismiss and then didn't want to let me answer... and that's what happened in my foreclosures, the lawyers would make it so I couldn't answer and the judges would just let them do it. It is soooo stressful. So when there's that much stress I find my nerves and muscles give me a lot more trouble... I can barely walk because my feet go spongy and my legs feel like they are crumbling under me, and I can't remember things at all. I can't tell if I haven't fed the fish, or fed them three times in an hour... and then once the stress level gets up there my nerves react the way they did when I had tetanus and they make my stomach muscles so tight it bends me over. What's interesting about that is that people always put stress together with ulcers, stomach ulcers... so maybe the thing that happens is that stress changes the output of acid in our stomachs and that in turn causes us to get less vitamins and minerals from our food than we need... and maybe that's the immune system. I have no idea... I just wonder... http://www.health-boundaries-bite.com/Fingernails.html Your fingernails reflect your health -- Learn some warning signs -- Karen Kline Post Edited (For) : 3/13/2007 8:56:37 AM (GMT-6)","so sorry Snowy gez are ya ever gonna catch a break I have seen the commercial yes I have boughten one container and seems okay but as for Pylori I had a scope last yr and found out I had it you are right it is about 2000 mg of antibitics and also prepulsid and that has to be injested twice daily H- Pac is what it is called and many ppl have it and dont know it It is good to be checked for this as it causes so many other problems in ouir guts as well as the others .

A Special Poem from David AKA Rabbin .........,"In The Garden No matter where you look, to the north, the south, or even into the east? But in here, is where you will only find, God’s love and peace! In the midst of His garden, He has set two trees. One whose fruit, is the fruit of innocence and of all the things, that we should be. While the other holds the fruit of knowledge of all the things both right and wrong. Things difficult to hear, even in the word of angel’s song! All things continually whispered, within your heart, echoed in your ear as time goes on! For that’s as it is, in this garden of life my dear, Only filled with all things that are sweet and pure! So welcome, to this garden my loving friend. Now take care where you walk, so as not to offend! Here is the essence of life, from it’s beginning, to its unconceivable end. In this garden you will find loving seeds, That man must work, to keep away hateful weeds! And in its fruit there is much life, like it is when two come together, as a husband, and as a wife! Nothing here is borrowed, sold nor can it be used, or put up for rent! For it holds the secrets of where you began, and of where we all shall be sent! The garden is the secret, of eternal life, oh it’s nothing hidden, nor is it out of sight. It’s just what’s found in loving and seen by His Holy light! Now take my hand, as you walk into the Garden, from out of the dry dessert sand. There now, rest for a while under The Tree of Life, where nothing’s wrong and all, will be made right! In the garden He is called, Jehovah, Yahweh, Allah and God! I tell you, He is the same God of Jacob, Isaac and Abraham. The same who made you, from dust of this land. In hear it is peace, that you shall find, That is if you enter carefully, always remembering to be loving and kind? By; David M. Schare aka rabbin","I did read the Christmas tree and will post it more towrds Holidays It had me in tears sad and good ones thanks so much Sorry had to cut short but with cait sick had a rough day God Bless Loves Lyn

I need advice...,"This is my first post. My mother is 74 years old. She is a diabetic and had her heart valve replaced a couple of years ago. She has been on Zoloft for the past 4 years. She lives alone in a ground floor condo. I live in the same development in the next building over. I am her primary caregiver. Over the past several years (6-10) we've noticed her becoming more forgetful. It mainly revolves around timing, (day, month, date, etc.) Two years ago we took her to a geriatric pychiatrist. He performed a congnitive evaluation which she scored 27 out of 30. He perscribed Aricept. She took Aricept for a year and we went back for another evaluation. She scored 28 out of 30 (with a little help...) He thought she should take Namenda and Aricept. She has been on both drugs for the past year. Since starting Namenda, she has been much more emotional. She also is having very vivid dreams or imagines things that don't happen. It is very hard to convince her that she imagined these things. (Things like people kissing her, or being upset with her.) Although my mom has memory issues, she is still able to do many things like make coffee, use the microwave, use the remote control, shower and dress herself, do laundry, use the phone, etc. She is just forgetful. I think she has gotten much worse since starting Namenda. I know that I may just be hoping that it is the drug and not her, but I can time most of these things back to her starting on it. Has anyone else's loved ones experienced these types of sypmtoms on Namenda? I have talked to her doctor but he says Namenda typically has little to no side effects. I am at the end of my rope and would love to hear from others in my position. Please help! Rob","Rob.......I am glad you found us here and thankful that Snowy answered this post she is the one I go to about meds as well .......Perhaps your Mom is one not able to take this medication either and it should be addressed at her next appoinitment ( if app is a bit away then make an earlier one IMO) I am so sorry about your Mom I too looked after Mom and now since she has passed away recently I am loooking after My step Dad........This is a horrid disease that robs us of our loved ones and I know it hurts to sit back and see this going on........I hope you know now you are not alone and we will be here for you ......in the Yellow at the side is Resources check them out as well .......there is good info in there but I must say you had the best peron answer you post .........SnowyLynne.........take care and Post again .......Gentle huggs to you,your family and your Mom BTW I believe that docs say ""meds dont have that side efffect"" well in all honesty How do they know for sure the person taking meds and those watching their going down hill are the best judges IMO .........Bless you


 bump


 Thanks for the great input sis Luvs Lyn I believe snowy mentioned the same drugs and problems with the one as well


 Not everyone can take Namenda.I was on it 2 months & it was the worst experience of my life & I remember it all.I took myself off it & swore,never again.Told my Neuro the same thing & he agreed. I take Razadyne & that's enough for me.I also take Remeron(antidepressant)as most of us with AD do get depressed.


 Hoping you have read Snowy's input LYN


 My husband has been having very vivid dreams too. But he didnt in the past. He had been on Namenda and Aricept for 2 years almost. The doctor took him off the Aricept and put him on Razadyne ER and the anti depresent Remeron. He is still having the dreams. I am beginning to wonder if it is the Namenda maybe or the fact that he has progressed further into the desease, He also takes pain meds for his back that he fractured in 3 places 3 years ago this May. Anyhow hang in there Rob. Be good to yourself as well. I did not realize how easy it is to get ran down until this year. Chillkoot


 I hope you are rading all the input on both threads and will let us know how things are going Lyn"
"CharlieRice, my 2¢","Charlie, I've been following your love story with your dear Jean and I don't want to interrupt with my thoughts on that dialog... Just want to tell you to skip filling out the 11 page form. They will not be able to use it for any type of training. What you are doing is similar to what Mother Theresa did... simple love and care. It's full time, as you said, like caring for a baby. Lots of cleaning and feeding and cleaning again. No one but a loving person could do what you do and in an institutional setting, training staff to accomplish this quality of care is impossible. I'm sorry to say that but it's true. Even if someone could be trained to care like you do, not just give good physical care, but to emotionally feel compassion for the patient, there is no way to financially compensate them for the sacrifice of time and life that you are doing. My son did this type of care for his grandmother. He took 2 and 1/2 years of his life to help her meet her death with dignity and he was forever changed by the task he undertook. I believe that your quiet example helps anyone who reads your words to see that love is the only way to get through this type of end of life experience. I think of you often and remember you in my prayers. Please accept my good thoughts and remember you are not alone in your task. We are all wishing you good health and strength until you can see her safely home. Take care.","Thanks for the great input Jeannie


 Jeannie, I'm stunned, what a beautiful post. It was once said of me ""You can give but you can't take."" There is a degree of truth in that, for when some one gives me a present I tend to choke up and want to hide. People say 'you never know what you got until it's gone'. It's the reverse with me, and why Jean always used the phrase 'your strange'. If you start out in life with nothing, I mean someone to turn to from age 2 to 16 (I was brought up in male Institutions) it tends to bring into sharp focus the riches of family and friends that people all around, take for granted. On release from my second Institution after years of abuse and hard work I was emotionally barren, my development levels stunted, even unaware there was a difference between boys and girls. In other words I was a stranger in a strange world, but oh what a wonderful beautiful world it is and to be free to enjoy it. Been shut away from the world as a child has proved to be a blessing I've managed to educate myself and appreciate things most people take for granted. Best of all I found a beautiful coalminer's daughter who managed to get past my invisible barrier and with gentle kind ways inspired me to fulfill all my dreams. When I look back I'm surprised at what I have achived, in sport, work and finance able to retire at age 54. I know I'm going on a bit, but I have to mention your bigest surprise, Charlie, the last time I was called that was under age 16, I'd grown up with that name, but just before 16 I was told it's not my name anymore. They'd taken away a childhood my identity but not my number 11536. Some thing they failed to take was the blessing of love. Most of my life I would't dare talk of my past, but now at my age it matters no more. Jeannie, I thank you from the botom of my heart for adding to my sense of self worth. God bless.


 BUMP"
FEELING LIKE THERE'S NO WHERE TO TURN,"I've been lurking on the site for a few weeks..I'm still not sure I feel ready and comfortable with posting, but I'm feeling so alone and vulnerable and afraid and confused and just tired. This is long, but I just need to get this out and see if anyone here can make me feel safe and tell me where to go. I am a newly single mom of 3 kids. I have fibromyalgia and feel like my plate is full on my end, but I am dealing with so much more than that these days. Please forgive me if I'm posting inappropriately or in the wrong area..I just really need to get this out to people who might understand. My 76-year-old dad has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's for the past 5 years, and has taken a sudden turn for the worse this past year. He had eye surgery about 9 months ago and has been impossible since then. It just breaks my heart..he walks and paces the floor non-stop, except when he's sleeping. He's ocd with personal hygiene, yet can't tell clean clothes from dirty ones or remember that if they're in the clothes hamper, they're dirty. He used broken razors and cut himself badly on the face. He spends hours trying to tweeze whiskers. The biggest problem is that he's become so agitated and violent at times that my poor mother has been afraid of him. She won't and hasn't admitted to me how often this occurs, but I can hear it in her voice. I can also hear in her voice how tired and fatigued she is. Her blood pressure has sky-rocketed, and she's had to give up all her ""fun"" in life while she watches the man she loves and built her life with deteriorate. He doesn't recognize her and becomes angry and beserk if she tries to drive their car, insisting it's his wife's but not recognizing that she IS his wife. He doesn't remember his parents have been dead for 30 years. He doesn't remember when they moved into the house they live in now..he asks every day what town they live in. He has ""false memories"" of things that didn't happen...he gets so angry and upset about the people who come into the house and take things and move things. (none of which happened..so we don't know if he dreams this or is combining things that happened years ago??) He refuses to let my mother drive the car because it's ""mom's,"" and she tried to sell the treadmill that she bought last year and he refused to use because it's also ""mom's."" At first my mom & I wanted & discussed that they move closer to where I live so I could relieve her some every day, into a senior citizens facility where she might find support and he might find men his age to visit with, since that seems to be the only thing he enjoys. (He can't concentrate to read or watch tv.) We held off on that because she's concerned that taking him out of his familiar home will cause greater confusion and agitation. (Although I question if that was the right decision seeing as how he doesn't even remember what town he's in now..but I can see where a new ""home"" might cause some problems.) She has no help...my siblings all live over an hour away and we take turns on the weekends coming to visit with him so she can get out and go to church and bible study. She is starting to attend a support group this month, but it's only 1 hour every month. I just don't know how much longer she can take care of him, but I don't know what our options are. He has a VA dr so I feel like we get very little help in this department, and I don't know where else to turn. He took Aricept for the first 3-4 years and then it stopped helping at all. I can't tell you at the moment the new medication he's on but it makes him sleep. She feels guilty that he sleeps so long and for wishing he'd sleep longer. Anyway, I feel better just sharing my story. It's so easy for outsiders to say ""he needs to be in a nursing home if she can't handle him."" Well he's not to that point yet, and she worked in one for years so she's well aware of the problems with care in those places where she lives. That would most definitely require a move when the time comes. It's beneficial to come here and read your stories and share mine and know that you've all wondered these things, too. I pray constantly for my mom and my dad, and I worry so much about HER health. She misses her life..her church friends, her bible studies, her talking on the phone with sisters and friends, seeing her grandchildren (the noise kids make causes him to get extremely agitated and angry.) Again, thank you for listening. Kim","Hello,I am writing because I just called my Dr.and by the time I got thru with their staff I hung up crying.I had back surgery in 2003 and since I was on Worker's Comp no one wants to see me because WC makes it so hard on them to treat people.One of the Case WORKER'S AT WC TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR MY RX'S FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.So I go to my PC and he put's me on Hydrocodiene 10,and I was going to find me a back Dr.Then I got a new Case Worker he call's to tell me they will not pay for my Dr. or my RX's with my PC and to be fair I should see my Back Dr.I have called so many Dr's that I am at the end of my rope.What is the sence of this terrible life with pain.All I wanted to do was see the Dr.because i am hurting so bad.Not just in my back and leg but in my sholder,stomack.I have been Dx.with FYBRIMYALGIA,NEURAPATHY,BONE SPURS ALL AROUND MY BACK AND TAIL BONE.TESTERDAY I reached up and felt like I tore ligaments in my armI ask the girl at my PC if he did not want to see me and should I find another pc.I am so tired I will go to bed and sleep,gets so dizzy cannot walk.some life thank you

Hello from a newbie!,"Hi out there. I wanted to introduce myself to everyone. I've been searching the web for info about Alzheimer’s and found this board.

 Would love to hear from you Make sure all is as good as it can be ......... Lyn


 Hi, Well my cat has Alzheimer's, so she meows a lot. Apparently it's because she forgets where she is and so she meows to get attention, it can get annoying because she does it at very early hours of the morning and does it practically 24/7. She also has a brain tumor (according to the vet), the poor cat. Just thought that I would share that with you because I kind of know what it's like to know someone (yes pets are people too) who has it and the annoyance and sadness of it.


 Hi Lyn, Thanks, my mum is getting the vet to come to the house to put her down. I suppose I knew that this was going to happen sooner or later so I became emotionally detached (im very good at that, lots of practice) to her. I feel down in the dumps at the moment because of teenage issues and realising something that I wished had never happened to me. I am also considering going to talk to a counsellor but then my parents would just yell at me and I couldn't really expose my secret to them......I have CF. I got into a fight with my dad recently because an old friend who has left the school told her mum that I had it and then she went and questioned my dad on it. I just feel depressed for no reason, I suppose because I've realized that my life span is now shortened and that I might not be able to do what I want to do in life. Part of me just wants to give up and the other part wants to prove the doctors wrong but I am torn between the decision.

 Hi there I am glad to see you again...sometimes parents can be rough to deal with and dont understand what you are feeling .......

 Hi Lyn, Sorry but I have 4 music exams coming up this year (eeek!) and heaps of homework. Well the vet is coming tonight, I have until 9pm. I know her through her dad (who owns the pharmacy down the road from me) and my mum said that I might be able to do work experience (I want to be a vet when I'm older) at the RSPCA where she works. It would be fun but I don't know. I really should be posting on the depression one, but who knows. The girl next to me is insulting me because I don't show my ""Depression"" outwardly for my cat. I'm now spouting nonsense. Ah well, girls at my school are emotionally immature and about 1/200 of the would understand. Cheerio (Yes i am trying to be happy )


 Hi Lyn, Thanks you don't know what it means to know that someone is here ready to listen to me and my little woes. I'll probobly post tonight, I'm letting my sarcastic side come out which is my way to protect my feelings.

Is Alzheimers Hereditory?,"I am so worried about this. My mum died last March from Alzheimers at the age of 61 (which was quite young for an Alzheimers sufferer.) She had the illness for 9 years so was even younger. I am just so worried now that maybe this disease is hereditory. Because I have watched her go through this, I dont think I could go through this myself. What are the chances of siblings etc having this also.","Sorry I should have said I BELIEVE chances are very low for you Talk to your doctor and there are things you can do with him for this as well LYN

Its such a relief as I am trying to deal with this on my own. Your Dad too, oh my word. . . how are you managing?. I guess we just do dont we? When we love someone we hold on and do whatever we can. God bless you and may He bless you for what you are doing. I hope we can help each other and i hope you dont mind if I stick around. I havent actually dealt with this and still believe she is around. . . . .somewhere anyway. I pray my mum is with the Lord as we did chat about this while she was ill and she did repeat things after me so with the faith that I have, I believe she is with God. If you dont mind, I would love to pray daily for your dad. What is his name? Where do you live. Are you in the UK?

I have a family and we are all feeling the strain. we all pitched in to help as much as we could. please i m looking for info on how to get her placed in a nursing home everyone keeps telling me because of her age that she cant be helped there has to be something were not being told my mother cant be the only 56 year old person in the u.s. with this afliction sincerely, Steve C","Hi there and welcome to Healing Well I am sorry for all you are dealing with Please check out the NH thread which shows the Homes and what goes on in them rates them actually as well check your local RETIREMENT Homes or the ones that provide great care and hopefully not to expensive I had a retirement home here in Canada and I had ppl younger than your mom There are also places to call like Social services and the Azlheimers Society may be able to help you as well as Mental Health Please do read the threads I have up about homes and what you should /need to be asking prior to placing your loved one there and YES they have to provide you with full disclosure and reports on the home I wish you all the best and hope that you will stay with us This is a hard long road but we can do it when we have support and understanding ppl going thru simuliar situations God Bless Let us know how you make out please .....Jules: thanks for your support and input LYN


 BUMP


 So sorry to hear of your mother. My husband is 47 years old and diagnosed with lewy body dementia- after much struggle and trying to care for him at home-we placed himin a nursing home on january 31st of this year. He actually does better in the nursing home then he did at home, he has 24/7 care and is with like people and seems to be florish under these circumstances. You have to remember that when the ad patient is at home- they are surroned by people that do not have ad- and cannot communicate and follow the every day lives of the people that they are surronded by. Good luck.... One hint I might provide for you would be to look for a nursing home that is small. And make sure that you check with the state for any violations that the home may have. The home should also provide you with thier state evaluations----very important.... Jules

68% less chance of Alzheimer's with a Mediterranean diet,"Well it's becoming more evident all the time that disease like AD can be prevented by taking care with your diet, which is probably the most important factor.

Just found out Mom has AD,"I'm new to this area. I've posted before on chronic pain. My mom was diagnosed a few month ago with AD but it has been coming on for awhile. She is 81 years old and is going down hill fast. My two brothers and I are going over to her house tomorrow to talk to her about moving her into an assisted living facility. We've toured the facility and it's lovely. Also my brother is on the Board of Directors of the place. I'm sick at heart to be doing this. I physically can't care for my mother and my brothers have their reasons as well. Mom only lives a few blocks from me. When she moves she'll be 20 minutes away. I sound like a little girl missing her mommy, but we've always lived close to each other. I feel like such a Judas for placing her in a home and I just don't know how to handle it. All I do is cry. I know it's in her best interests but I'm just sick. Someone please help me. How do you handle this? Thanks.","I do have a Thread about emotions and in one post I talk about not getting the Guilts if you are not physiccaly ,mentally or financially able to care for them at home Alot of ppl just cannot You have found a place your brother is involved in and very close to you Personaly I think you are doing a great job in looking out for your Mom I am so sorry about her DX and I do know how it feels I lost Mom a yr ago and now look after Dad with same horrid disease Stay with us please and read some of other threads My info is under name if you would like to email me and talk more about this You are being a very good daughter Please DO NOT be so hard on self LYN


 Thanks for the response and the support. We met with mom today and the first hour was horrible. Finally she sort of started to understand where we were coming from in that we love her and want her around for as long as possible. It was truly heart breaking. The only thing that helped was that I was so exhausted from the not sleeping and crying leading up to our meeting that I was almost numb when we met. Lyn - I'm sorry for your loss of your mom and for you in the loss of your real dad even though he is still here with you. Life seems to just knock the wind out of us on a continuous. Five years ago my 25 year old daughter was in a drunk driving accident (she wasn't driving) and is now a quadriplegic. God brought a wonderful man into her life and they were married on Sept 6, 2006. We are so proud of them and I am especially proud of my daughter. She is a very strong woman. Thanks again for the support and for the references to read. Take care!


 Hi Melanie. I'm sorry you & your family are having to deal with this. Keeping your mom's safety & security in mind may make your decision of an assisted living facility easier on your heart & soul. Hang in there.


 I have brought some threads forward for you that may help do remember to check out Resources at the side in Yellow LYN


 No problem at all....... Thanks for your kind words about Mo it was and is very difficult for me and my daughter we both looked after all her needs and she went so suddenly as well so that too was hard It is very hard what you had and have to deal with but please do not have GUILT Sometimes we have to remember that we cannot do and be all especially when we ourselves are sick......... I know you are heartbroken I really do but in the longrun you are doing what is best for her and for you thats what counts IMO....... I would like you to stay posting and getting the SUPPORT you need from this site and know I am here for you at any time as will others be I do know how you feel and I totally empathize with you God Bless and please look after self My dad is doing ok but he is basically going to go with a broken heart I know it and feel it I am just waiting with bated breath feeling his pain for him You be well and post again REMEMBER I am here okay LYN"
She pushed me.,"Mother-in-law came over in the morning angry because last night when she went to kiss the baby (2 year old) goodbye. The baby, who was busy eating dinner, pushed her away. Well my mother-in-law was furious because the baby had food on her hand and it ruined her shirt, and she was mad because how dare that baby push her! When I tried to explain that the baby didn't know any better because she is only two, my mother-in-law became furious at me and pushed me-hard and said, see, how do you like that. I ran into the garage, where my husband was hiding, I mean cleaning, and demanded that he go deal with her. (he missed the whole incident) then I took the baby and hid in the bedroom until she left. Now Monday I start back to work and I am terrified that my husband, who I am leaving the baby with, will take off and leave his mother to watch the baby. When I try to talk to him about it he justs gets mad at me and he won't listen. How do I get him to realize that it is not safe to leave the baby and grandmother alone together. He just thinks I hate his mom or something even though I do everything for her.","How are you doing


 Did a lot of talking to my husband over the weekend. He agreed to go somewhere quiet with me, away from everyone so we could talk. (I think suggesting he go salmon fishing helped him agree to this.) He went fishing down river a lot leaving me and baby to play in the sand, but at least I had him trapped in the car.:) Anyway I feel I have gotten through to him at least on the most important things. He has agreed to not leave baby and grandma totally alone together. I agreed it would be OK to be right outside working in the yard as long as he is close at hand. He agreed not to let grandma take baby for stroller walks unless he goes with them. Also I am going to try working night shift, so during the day I am sleeping, but there for emergencies. (I started work today but it was only orientation.) Also talked to grandma. This was harder. I really hurt her feelings when I said her memory was getting bad. I won't go over the whole conversation but she understands (for the moment at least) that she will be helping my husband with the babysitting and not doing it by herself. With work starting and the home study course I have taken on I won't be writing for a long while. I will probably check in and read others posts once in a while. But if you don't hear from me, know I am still around reading once in a while. Lyn, especially thank you for your support. I think I just read you weren't feeling well so I hope that changes, and you feel better soon. Remember you have to take care of yourself first, before you can properly care for others..............................Inert


 I am glad you got some things straightened out BUT I do so agree with Snowy on this hun she will lash out on that baby if it does something she does not like she is angry as it is .Make sure Hubby watches very very closely please I am feeling much better thanks for your concern 'you look after you please and keep us posted okay Luv lyn

Medical Power Of Attorney..,"Hello I am Kitt and I am new here on the site but I can give you some information that I believe is still current. A Medical Power of Attorney is a document, signed by a competent adult, i.e., ""principal,"" designating a person that the principal trusts to make health care decisions on the principal's behalf should the principal be unable to make such decisions. The individual chosen to act on the principal's behalf is referred to as an ""agent."" The agent may make health care decisions on the principal's behalf only if the principal's attending physician certifies in writing that the principal is incompetent. The physician must file the certification in the principal's medical record. I would check with the attorney in the state where the POA was drawn up to see if rules differ from state to state. I was POA for my mother and had access to her bank accounts, medical records etc but it was all written into one document. The day she died the POA becomes invalid. That was the state of Wisconsin. I am sorry you are running into legal issues and I hope you can straighten out the problems. **Kitt thanks so much I added a title to your thread you can change it to whatever you like .I have found that with titles more will read and /or give input** Hope to see you post often...........LYN Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 4/20/2007 7:55:40 AM (GMT-6)","How are you doing thanks for this info Hope to see you post again LYN

Question about nursing homes for Alzheimers patients,"Hi....I help moderate the UC forum, but my friend had a question. His uncle has Alzheimers and is now physically abusive, and please excuse me if I'm using the wrong term here. His aunt has put a deadlock on her bedroom door as she doesn't know what else to do, and says that there isn't any nursing home that will take him because he is so out of control. She lives around the Albany, New York area. Can anyone help or give me direction about this? Thanks for your help!","Can you advise? Is there a specialist who deals with Alzheimer's, and what type of meds? I just need to point this person in the right direction. Thanks so much for your response; I feel so badly when people sound so helpless.....I'm trying to get them to resources like HW!


 Thanks Lynn for the advice, I kind of thought there must be more resources out there for her and better meds for them to try. The state of New York actually has a program where they will come out and evaluate people and recommend care, so I'll make sure and tell them that as well. I appreciate all the help, and if the family has any more questions, I'll send them to HW. I thank heavens for HW!


 He needs a Dr who will be agressive in medicating him to keep him calm.


 HI Carol Yes I think he should be seen by a good Neurologist and a Gerientoligist (sp) Meds like ATIVAN are not good nor recommended for AD ppl as they will only cause more delusions and aggressiveness There are homes wioth Lock down areas and they specialize in this type of behaviour Please tell your friend I am truly sorry I am praying for her I am going to bump the Nursing Home Thread up for you's as well to check out places in her area COME back anytime or ask your friend to drop in as well ....

Relationship between blunt force trauma and AD?,"Some 30 to 35 years ago, my wife who is now 65 was severely beaten by closed fist and foot by her former husband. In 2004 her first neurologist first suspected the above while ruling out AD, and ordered an MRI. With the results of the MRI, he recanted and came in with the diagnosis of AD, stating that it was very early. My wife withheld knowledge of the beatings from him. Since then, we switched to a different neurologist who is geographically closer to us, confirmed MCI, and who had us see a neuropsychologist. After the first visit with both of us present, he said that she had been masking AD for some time with high intellect and charm. As a silent observer, I sat there and watched her skew her MCCI responses. After the second visit without my presence, but with another doctor, she recounted the beatings. His diagnosis was that while the trauma caused by the beatings did not cause the AD, it without a doubt did cause the percipitous drop from MCI in early 2005 to stage 6 now. My questions to Snowy and others is how do I deal with the anger and accational rage that I feel toward Mr. ex? I can deal with him on an intellectual level, but not on an emotional level. What and/or how much do I tell my 33 year old step daughter with whom I have finally achieved normalcy and bond?","I toally agree with Snowy on this one .My heart goes out to you and I understand your frustration and anger.... I would limit any contact with him at all and yes the daughter does need to know as well...... Please post often and let us know how you are doing Take care Lyn


 Hi Bill.......Would the beatings your wife had taken been logged anywhere such as hospitals or are there peeps that witnessed this ?? I believe also a Neuroligist could most likely piece it all together by the history of her abuse and all that happend especially the trauma to her head. It has to be possible my guess would be a nuerologist first and tests will show inconclusivily that she had been beaten severly on her head thus connecting the AD,I agree to chronologically put this all together for her I am so sorry for your wife this makes my blood boil I wont call him a man that is not what men do however I hope you can nail him to the wall My thoughts and prayers are with you You can also see if Alzinfo.Org may be of some guidance ........ Take care and God Bless......... Lyn


 My daughter and I had our conversation regarding the likelyhood that her blood father is probably responsible for the severity of her mother's Alzheimer's if not the disease itself. Her response was that if Alzheimer's had to be that it is best to be over with quickly.


 After being dx with Ad 9 yrs both my new Neuro.& family Dr.Think I have MCI rather than AD for now.I'm still doing so very well.


 I don't really know how I feel. I need some time to sort this one out. My initial reactions tend to be wrong, so I've learned to shut up until the smoke clears.


 How are you doing ??


 i'm being retested on the 20 th of this month.


 hmmmmmmmm okay I will have a look see I knew it had to do with that so I was thinking somewhere along a stroke line But I will check into that for you kk Glad you are doing good Be well Luvs lyn


 How is it going Snevet?? Just wondering how things are Lyn


 Bill, my hubby had serval head traumas. The first as a small child becauuse of his older brother pushing him down stairs the others at various jobs. I too felt such anger when we were fighting Labor and Industries because they were refusing to take his AD into account. They said it was diagnosed after his injury so they wanted to retrain. !!! Ok I didnt give up and I fought and found PROOF that he had on the job brain injuries and they now finally after THREE YEARS said he doent have to participate in vocational retraining as he had previous memory problems. We are now getting somewhere. Now I am the one who was beaten by Mr.X and I still have head aches and problems it has been 23 years ago but I sometimes think could I have furture problems.. Chill


 I was refering to snevet (Bill ) my hubby is Larry sweetie.. But, ya it has been a LONG fight coming to a close hopefully. We are now seeing some major changes in his body. Cant tell if really hungry unsure if he should eat or not. Falls ALLOT. Anyhow he keeps on joking and tries so very hard to stay up beat.


 Snevets .... Just wondering how things are I am going to start a thread on Head traumas brain injurys and see what all comes up LYN Hoping you are well and daughter


 The daughter needs to know.Good,bad or indifferent.I'm sure she knew but chose not to address it. You should not have to deal with her EX regardless.You are her husband now. Larry my wonderful husband would loved to have gotton ahold of my EX & beaten him into oblivion.


 The EX lives some 500 miles away and has not shown his face since 20 years ago, so contact with him is probably not going to happen. Snowy, you are correct, my daughter is aware that beatings took place, but will not fully accept that they should fall in the realm of assault. I guess the issue becomes how do I link the AD with the trauma? My inclination is to patch together her mother's medical chronology as factually as I can and force her to draw her own conclusions. Your thoughts please. Bill


 bump for bill


 That seems like a harsh reponse to me Do you feel the same way about this AD is not a death sentence and yes they do get pretty bad off but they are still alive and with us New memories can be made Please let me know how you are God Bless Lyn


 Yes you are sweet Snowy thank God for that and you How are you and Larry doing ?? Take care Lyn


 I so do agree with that one it is for the best at times especially times such as this Please keep in touch Will be thinking and praying for you Lyn


 SnowyLynne said... After being dx with Ad 9 yrs both my new Neuro.& family Dr.Think I have MCI rather than AD for now.I'm still doing so very well. Can some one explain to me what MCI is please?


 I am fine Lyn thankyou I looked up Myocardai Infarction and it seems to be to do with heart attacks. I dont understand the connection with AD.


 It is explained in the ""retested thread "" I was way off base lol Lyn


 How are you doing snevet been doing some thinking bout you and daughter have things changed or getting better at all for you's This si a hell for sure but I know I would have never traded the last few yrs o ff moms life nor the time I am having with Dad for anything I guess it may be a bit easier for me to some extent as I have always been around seniors and Alzheimers But when it hits this close to home it is too real and I cant go home at night ya know Anyways thinking about you Lyn


 Ahh Chill sorry sweetie I have no idea why it was in me to bump this thread yeserday intervention by the big Guy maybe ya know I also am afraid to to some nasty head injuries but at the hands of a boyfriend and also due to stupidity when drunk I am glad you were fighting for Bill and finally cleared that up How are you doing otherwise Luvs Lyn


 OOPSSSSS I read that one too early lol Glad to see you hun Mom was falling so much at the end on me I had to really watch her every move she looked like Ricky Raccoon all the time with hr eyes blackened and blue from falling so much as well she had seizures which caused alot of problems Be well hun 'Luvs to ya and Larry .........

Caregiving for those with Alzheimer's,"Hello, It seems as if the Alzheimer's community is paying more and more attention to the caregivers of those with Alzheimer's disease. The term ""caregiver burden"" is used to describe the stress involved in caring for those with Alzheimer's. I was wondering if anyone who is caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's could describe the toll that this responsibility has taken on him or her. Your response would be greatly appreciated! Willow","Willow .......Hi and Welcome to HW ........I am the caregiver for Mom and now I will be there for Dad........Yes I do get burnt out and I have to take time for me ....this is kinda where I go for that .........or I go for walks to try and clear my head ........I get so frustrated with my siblings as they dont and wont help........I use to be a geriatric nurse but we worked our shifts and came home ( although I always got to close lol) I am so close to parents house I see it from porch........Yrs ago my Mom and I drew up a letter had it notarized that she would not be put into a home (she was also a geriatric nurse)........at that time I was not DX with the crohns or PG and was not as sick as I have been but I do have my daughter and Hubby that will help out at times I need them .........respite care is worth it .....I have just started that for Mom and the government pays for it .........it was difficult at first but it is helping out now .......I have told my siblings that yes they have alzheimer's but I am still making memoeries ....they are not ......There are way to many peeps going into homes and I am not slamming any one for having to put parents/loved ones into homes I am able to do what I do as I am on disability an no longer able to nurse .......so I do empathize in both circumstances .......ya know when I was nursing and this is kinda off topic ......but interesting .....there was NOT one Chinese elder nor Native Canadian in the homes I worked in their seniors ,elders are revered and looked after within the family unit....just a bit of trivia .......Anyways Willow thanks for your input and you too Snowy .........Yes it is hard at times I have 2 homes to look after (I am OCD so that helps lol) and I also have anxiety /panic disorder so I constantly worry when I am not there ........I go over there in the am when I am done on here .....do what needs to be done and then try and get Mom out in the fresh air if only to the post office and for a cup of tea (at a restaurant uptown she always went to )....I bring her over here and she has ""HER PILLOW lol"" and will lay on my sofa watching tv for a bit then naps .....I know she is comfortable and calm when she does that ........Her aggitation level has gone way down since I told her doc off about the Ativan he had put her on .....not a med for AD (documented)........I will also do crafts with her or do something she likes to do depending on her mood and what she wants to do ....I come home do my thing here and I have to go back ,rub her legs down and get her ready for bed sit and talk a bit and then get her a snack her meds ( I am making sure she takes them ).....and get her comfy for the night but I worry all night long for the dang phone to ring ......I would not change what I do for her nor for my Dad Willow ........I just needed to get respite care and I did and that has helped me out tremendously...........thanks for the thread I needed to vent .........God Bless ........Lyn

 Oh Lyn, I felt so sad for you when I read your post. It was awful of your family not to help out when you most needed them. I am not surprised that you blew a gasket ,they deserved it and more. Maybe this episode will make them realise just what you are having to deal with day in and day out. It realy is time that they did their share in my opinion. I hope that you are feeling a bit better now. As a sufferer of UC for 25 years(until my Ileostomy surgery 3 years ago) I can say that I know how you feel when you are struggling with your Crohns. How you cope I just don't know,especialy as you have other health problems on top of the crohns. I am glad that you do get respite from time to time,it realy sounds like you need it. Take care Sue


 Hey Blue how are you??.......Yes I do the majority of the housework and I do up meals and freeze which ticks my Dad off lol as he was a chef (actually can still cook some pretty good food ).........I have Howie and Cait yet it is getting hard on them both she is a straight A student and he was just promoted to a supervisory position which holds a lot of responsibility and shift work so I am getting a girl to come in every couple of days it is someone from town here so I do know them and they know my parents ......It is a hard yet very rewarding thing I am doing at imes I do get tired out and down with health ......my family were all in denial and shock with the meeting Sunday .......they all said ""oh yeah for sure I can help ."" ya okay I called one of them yesterday as I wanted to celebrate Howies Promotion ....just the 3 of us here I am so proud of him avery hard worker and a great hubby and father .......No ome was able to stop their lives for even a couple of hours so all I had said went on deaf ear ......I wont waste my breath again ya know ........Thanks for your concern and hope to hear from you again .....God Bless..Lyn


 Snowy you are too funny but oh it is good to laugh ....and it is true ....take care ....God Bless


 Hello and Merry Christmas to all! I'm a caregiver to my mother-in-law who will be 80 in a few more days. I'd like to address first the guilt trips I put myself on for not being more patient. It's a difficult job and I keep reminding myself I will be there soon myself and how would I like to be treated. Respite is available, however in the two yrs. we've taken care of her she's only been away for 2 wks. and that was because my husband was having surgery and I couldn't care for two people at the same time. She came home from the NH claiming that someone had taken advantage of her while there and she won't go back. Bless her heart, she told us she might even be pregnant. I'm 100% positive this never happened. She has suffered with paranoid schizophrenia all of her life. She is physically disabled enough to be on a walker for several yrs. now and falls frequently in the night (only when getting on the bedside commode). I've situated it right next to the bed w/plenty of light from a night light, but I'm guessing she's not allowing her BP to adjust before she stands up to sit down on the commode. You can reiterate this repeatedly, but with her alzheimers you may as well save it. I'd love to take her out more as I know it would be good for her, but she's a handful even w/the walker (that has the seat to sit in when she tires). She wanted to shop for Christmas and we took her against our better judgement and 5 min. into the store and she was ready to leave w/o anything in her basket. Even before the alzheimers really set in when she would ask how you're feeling & if you are truthful and say perhaps that you have a headache then she in turn has a headache too, etc. I politely tell her even when I'm feeling absolutely horrible that I feel real good today. If I were to be truthful then she automatically has the same symptoms you do and require sympathy and bedrest. I think it's a triple whammy as she's been diagnosed with schizophrenia, senile dementia, and alzheimers. My mother-in-law may outlive both of us (hubby & myself) because the responsibility does create many health problems with the caregivers. I have an anxiety disorder which was pretty well under control before this and then since I'm taking coumadin my physician took me off of my hormone replacement medicine so I am having power surges and mood swings that leave me feeling like a piece of burnt toast. I had two deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) in my leg a year ago this month and I'm still suffering the consequences of it (edema and pain). I need to take better care of myself, however there's always something to be done. My husband is an only child so there's no one else to help with the responsibility. It's very depressing. My husband works in the medical field long hours and because I was unemployed @ the time she couldn't do for herself anymore it was my suggestion we move her in with us. I've worked as a CMA/CNA and beleive me it's much easier to care for a patient like Mom when you're not related and closely linked. Lyn, I've often thought about the fact that the Chinese/Japanese people revere their elders and they're seldom institutionalized. Their whole family and extended family gets involved in their care. Wouldn't that be fantastic if more of us in the U.S. could do this? By the way Lyn, what is OCD? I know it's probably similiar to my CRS syndrom. LOL My health has been failing for the past two yrs. and I feel like I'm stuck in a turnstile and can't get out. I'd appreciate hearing from others with their experiences regarding this subject. Meanwhile I'll keep asking God to give me the ability to accept that which I cannot change. I couldn't find a spell check on here, so please forgive me if I've mispelled some words. God bless you all and don't do as I do, but do as I say! Take care of yourselves!!! BlovedOne


 Just wondering how all are doing Hoping new year brings you good things Luvs and God Bless Lyn


 Wanting to wish ALL you wonderful Caregiver's out there that celebrate Easter a very safe and Happy Easter God Bless LYN


 Bringing back up for new members to read


 65% of caregivers die before the LO does because they don't take care of themselves.They NEED time away for respite,either have a service to come In or put the person In respite In a NH or carehome for a short time,a week or two.Even putting them In a daycare 3 or 4 times a week.That helps but caregivers do need more time to rest & recoup.


 Lyn, Do you believe your anxiety problem is an effect of your role as a caregiver for an individual with Alzheimer's, or was it present before? Willow


 I was sick for a few days and I could not look after Mom nor help with Dad ........My siblings were SUPPOSSED to do this for me.............I found Mom laying in soiled clothing ,sheets the works ,I blew a gasket literally .......there is NO excuse for what they put our parents thru ......notta ....none ........I am so hurt ,yet angry and they all know it now .....Most times I keep it in and I get sick from doing so ....this time I let it all out and they didnt know whether to run ,crap lol.......or what to do .......How can they honestly live with themselves knowing theses 2 wonderful loving parents gave them LIFE?????........God Bless ...Lyn ......sorry had to vent.......BTW I am the only child that is the step daughter all the rest are from both parents and yet HE is my father ya know


 Sue ...thanks for all your understanding and kind words .....I am sure glad to see you posting.........how are you doing anyways??.............do you have yahoo or msn or the aol im ??......if so we can chat together or I will email you ........thanks again hun and please do take care of self ......I am making sure the family gets the picture tomorrow (Sun) as I have called a ""family meeting"" and they will be told nicely yet VERY firmly they need to be there for the parents that were always there for them ...............I will let you know how it goes ....Howie will be home so temper will be under control lol.........God Bless my friend .......Lyn


 Caregiving is like trying to hold a beachball under water 24/7...............you need help!!!!


 Just checking in on caregivers as the Holidays approach it becomes more stressful IMO Make time for ""you"" as well Do not let self get sick or burnt out or you will not be any god for you or the person you are looking after LOL I should talk ........ Anyways hoping all are well Luvs Lyn


 Welcome to HW firstly You have come to a place that empathizes and will offer you much in support I looked after my mom she passed away in March and I too was the only one that did anything/everything other than a bit of wee stuff Cait my daughter did I have Anxiety and Panic disorder have had since young ,I have crohns and other illnesses and am 52 myself. I was quite ill at times with IV in after having treatments in and such but it was my Mom ya know Now I am loooking after Dad ( step) I loooked at him 2 days ago and I sear I was seeing him already gone I know in my heart he wont be here for long now His spirit and heart is broken he does not like being the way he is and forgetting things names places all the stuff he loved to do . I look like Mom and it scares me and I know even with the AD it takes him back ....... Again I am the only out of 4 that look after him and NOT one is ill They only came round for money I had my own home and was an R.N. bt had to retire Yes much easier when not closley related I believe too As for the Chinese way I would wish for that in a heart beat Our seniors and veterans that went to war for us are now where ,,sitting in some NH forgotten.......most Do you have the funds available to have someone come for respite care for a day even pick her up or take her to someplace for the day and you get you health better?? Believe your plight is not falling on deaf ears I feel I wrote your story to a point OCD is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder I have that as well I have to have home spotless ,count in groups of 3 or 5 lock doors in same groups of numbers Balancing everthing has to be one of the worst things lol I hope you will post back and let me know how you are and if you have MSN or yahoo please add me and we can chat I am in Ontario ,Canada Take care and God Bless you for being there for her even with all you have on your plate I do admire you for that Lyn


 I wish all the caregivers out there the best You are really doing a great thing IMO yes it can be hard and frustrating at times BUT I know I would not trade it for anything other than them not having this DD........ Dad going downhill and is so lost w/o mom will be trying to get him out to yardsales and fishing if possible very soon Weather finally looking up and time to get him outdoors more ...Loves to garden and such LYN


 In my honest opinion I believe Caregiver's are the most giving and unselfish ppl there are with all they do and the love they give ........ It is a hard thing at times but the benefits will always outweigh the trials and frustrations we do sometimes go thru God Bless the caregivers


 Havent seen you for quite awhile Willow How are you doing??"
Spouses of those with early onset,"I was hoping to connect with some spouses dealing with all that comes with early onset. Hope to hear from some that have the feeling they are mourning a loss of things. Things you once did, things that you wont ever do, things that you regrect. Thanks Renee","What is important is the family support especially the emotional and spiritual support. Make an activity together. You can play the music and dance, walk together in the park. dinner with candlelight, play cards, you can do gardening and from time to time give him memory test and avaluation. You can ask him...What is the date today or say three words and let him repeat it by himself...and many more. You can do a lot of things that you can enjoy together and he'll gonna like it.


 Renee I hope you had a great day at the beach and were able to talk with this person Please do let us know how it goes I hear ya sis I sit here and cry over MOm and now Dad with same DD It hurts so much to see them go this way He justs constantly says he wants to ""die and be with Mom"" Love ya sis Here for you always you know that LYN /sis


 Hi hun I am sure that there will be some input Mary is dealing with many issues right now as is Padraig Luvs ya n been missing you God Bless Sis


 thanks for the imput really appreciated. We have been dealing with this for a long time dx 3 years ago. We do allot of what you have suggested. I have I learned to hold onto the simple things in life. But I must admit friends there are days that I jus tsit at the computer and let the tears run... Our families are either dead or very far away, so today I am heading out to the beach to a senior center to talk with a lady there. I will report back thanks for all you support. YOU Are the ones who care..Renee"
What stage could she be in?,"Hello all, I know it is hard to pinpoint what stage someone is in with AD. My nan has been in the NH for 2 weeks now. They seem to be giving her more things to help sedate her. SHe still refuses to eat but will drink some ensure. They so have her walking around she is not incontinent. She refuses to eat even sticking her tongue out when trying to be fed. She recalled doing arts and crafts the other day but doesnt know what she made. Today she slept and barely spoke. She had her hair appt in the NH yesterday let them cut it but put up a fight when it came to setting it. She knows my moms face but cannot recall who she is even thinking that my mom was in fact me. The other night she had no idea who my mom was either however she knew my dad (my nans son in law) and her husband. When I went there on Sunday she knew me but had trouble remebering my husbands name until she overheard my papa saying hi to him. She is still having tremors daily she will just get up and walk around. On Sunday after my husband and I left and my mom was in my nans room (my nan is usually in the sitting room since there is a tv there). My mom came back to the room only to see my papa there my nan and dad were gone. She askjed papa where nan and my dad was he said she went out for a walk and does it all the time with no help. Needless to say my dad ran to her when he noticed she was going behind the nurses desk and sat down in a chair with wheels. Had my dad not ran there the chair would have rolled and she would have fallen. They also gave her a new walker yesterday and this one has a silver and blue sticker on it and that had her attention most of the day. Before her downward spiral she bought 2 wooden canes and covered them with metalic stickers and marabou feathers from the top of a pen. From this explanation can anyone here tell me what stage she may in fact be on?","It is difficult to definitely place a person an a particular stage. People vary in the length of time spent in each stage and in which symptoms appear. The stages overlap, but the way you describe your nana, she's still in the middle stage......This is the longest stage and complicated. Mental abilites decline, the personality changes and physical problems develop so that the person becomes more and more dependent on caregivers. She reacognized your face but forget yo ur name...


 It is hard to know what stage she is in but I would think at this point barring any medical problems she will be around for awhile yet .......... Each goes different my Mom was like this for a couple of yrs and wham on the couch could not do anything even go to bathroom Dad was good and wham went downhill so fast after mom passed it has me scared I truly believe he will not be here for much longer Maybe Mininmark has some inoput as well as Snowy and others Keep posting plz and stay with us Gentle huggs my friend I know this is rough with all your health problems as well ..........I think of you often ......... :LYN


 Minmark I do agree to a certain extent I appreciate your input"
what can be done?,"Hello everyone, I know I am new to this forum I am usually on other ones but it seems as though my grandmother has AD. It is tough I hear to determine if it is infact AD or dementia especially if she wont take tests to rule out the other possibilities. My question is what can be done to help aid her in her condition? At the nursing home they have her walking around a little, she still wont eat but has only been there about 24 hours now. She doesnt want a phone due to it costing extra (it is $250 a day without a lot of things). Her meds are purchased extra and if she wants tv she brings her own. as for cable that too is extra. They have never had cable but I wonder how many chanels she will be able to get insude the nursing home (it use to be a hospital). My family informed them today that she does not eat anything with butter or cheese but this was after they served pasta with sauce and cheese for lunch. We were glad to hear that she slept a couple of hours today which she has had trouble sleeping lately. She has been on adivan at least 15 years and that wasnt helping she was still agitated.","I am going to bring forth an old post on NH and what there ratings are as per care and all of it That seems to be QUITE costly IMHO especially with no real added extras ya know Snowy's input is right spot on .I know your Gradma is on Namenda for one and I do hope they take her off the ativan and give something else ......... Please stay with us D we are here to support you and help you thru all of this You are so caring and loving I am proud to know you are a great grandchild ....with Empathy LYN


 I really do feel your concerns and I know this has to be hard on all especially your Nan She loses all her independance and is now with ppl telling her what to do when and how I hope this will all be calmly settled and she will be looked after appropriately All you can do is keep bringing it to the attention of the head nurse or nurses on her floor ......constantly or as I have posted write it down and photocopy it all keep a file on what is going on Did you look at the ratings in thread on NH and find the one your Nan is in?? Luvs LYN Prayers and thoughts always


 I am sooooo bleeding happy to hear that D Good ones are hard to find I am glad yous did find a good one for her but with the love you's have it is no surprise be well friend LYN


 Ativan,or other benzo meds is detrimental to anyone with dementia.Aricept,Razadyne or Exelon are the prefered drugs to help with Dementia.Also Namenda which is taken with one of the other meds to help stablize the person.Antidepressants also are of a great help.Sometimes Antipshycotics are needed for extreme agitation,anger or combativeness............Hope this helps.


 When I was at the nursing home yesterday she kept having shaking fits. The nurse in the morning gave her a pill which neither my grandfather (papa) or grandmother (nan) knew what it was. The nurse was around later and my papa had her come to the sitting room we were in. She said it was trazadone (which both my mom and I have been on to aid in sleep), the nurse when speaking to my nan would notice the legs shaking and body shaking would stop. Therefore she knew it was not one of the seizures but knew it was anxiety. When I informed my mom that she has trazadone (2 per day prn) my mom wondered how many anti-depressants they had her on, they got her off paxil but she is on I think it is called remeron. My nan also has an itchy rash on her back which my mom told the nurses about which thankfully they knew about however they are only puttingh lotion and powder on it. I wish they would give her something to stop the itch or figure out what kind of rash it is so it can be treated properly. My papa has never been much of a phone person so when he is concerned about my nan he calls my mom and puts my nan on the phone which my mom cannot even hear her speak she is being too quiet. The nurses could not even hear her when they spoke over the intercom at the hospital. Yesterday she ate some breakfast, no lunch, half of an ice cream cup, and my mom said she ate about 1/3 of dinner which was hot dogs, beans and italian wedding soup so at least she is starting to eat there. What I also like about this place is that you get no urine odor while walking in (unless a patient has the odor on them which unfortunately happened she sat in the room with us for 2 hours and no nurses noticed the odor). My nan had her dentures in early in the day but is complaining about the inside of her mouth hurting therefore my papa took them out for her and cleaned them.


 the thread olnly lists 2 Nh for my state and the one she is in is not listed. However I went to abuse.com and granted the info there is old but it is one of the better ones in the state. This NH was highly recomended my many including a family friend who is a nurse. I also found a sit that ranks NH and the top score a NH couls get was 88 and hers got 86 the survey was completed latst month."
question,"Hello everyone, I was just wondering how doctor's know if a person is suffereing from Alzheimer's vs. Dementia?","My grandmother is 78 been gradually forgetting things for the past couple of years. I was hospitalized a few times this year for Crohn's related surgeries. The last time I was in the Hospital (late June) my grandparents were there evryday. Also more recently she had been on a shopping binge (small items such as stuffed animals, outdoor items ex bird bath (which has fake flowers in it), pinwheels etc. Also from what I understand she had set up the different rooms in her house as different themes ex: a kokopelli throw blanket is hanging from the wall with my ""tribal"" drum in front of it I also think she has more in that display as well. she bought a few canes recently too she has osteoporosis and multiple compression fractures. about 18 yrs ago she had a nervous breakdown and has been on Adivan since, also she is a breast cancer survivor. My grandparents anniversarry was July 2 they have been married 58 years. The weekend after their anniv. we had dinner over at my parents house and she refused to eat saying it was constipation but stated that she ate breakfast. A week or so later she went to the ER complaining of dizzyness, being lightheaded etc, at this point she had been eating again. They did a CT of her brain and found multiple TIAs from the past and more recent. They kept her in the holding area overnight not knowing if she was going to be admitted. In the morning sje woke up and was confused to where she was (she fell asleep in 1 room and awoke in another) they called my grandfather he went down and she relaxed. A cpl of weeks later she was drinking less and barely eating if eating at all. She kept complaining of nausea. On the 22 my mother went to her house before a relatives birthday party and she wasnt great, her brother and sister in law (grandmothers...my mother and I are only children) were there while my mother and father were at the party. After the party my parents went back over to the house. Due to her lack of eating she was barely walking. She had been in pain since she fell the week before and caused another compression fracture. At that walk in clinic they did x rays, then later they called her to go back the next day for another xray, her brother and sister in law took her. She said she had to use the retroom and my great aunt brought her in and then my grandmother asked what to do when in the bathroom. My aunt reasponded that she told them she had to urinate. Then my grandmother said oh yeah I sit down for that right? Ok back to the not eating. After the party when my folks went back there my mother smelled they keytones on her breath and called the rescue. She is going to be in the hospital until tomorrow medicare said she is stable and they wont pay for her to stay anymore. They did 3 EEGs and on the 2nd one a seizure was noted and now she is on dilantin. She is now off of paxil but still on adivan, as well as another depression med. They started her on 2 more meds as well one is an antipsychotic the other is for alzheimers. Some days she does great eating again others she claims she wants someone to give her something so she can die. This just made me question what type of brain disease is going on in this case. I wonder if it is Alzheimer's, dementia or due to the long term adivan or maybe a combo of these. Today my folks are out looking for a nursing home even though they saved $ so they could be taken care of at home. We are also having financial issues with them ex my mom's name is not on the house only on the will. Also they dont understand the gifting money to family members so that the other spouce will have $ to live off of they worked so hard for their money I just dont want a nursing home to take it all away. I went off on a tangent , sorry I do that quite often


 I would love for her to have a neuro consult but they are kicking her out of the hospital tomorrow. I dont know if she could be set up with a neuro at the nursing home she is going too. I mentioned the topic to my neuro last week when I was there and he mentioned coming off the meds can cause the seizures as well. She was doing pretty well (although not the best she had been) until her Psychiatrist slowly started to taper her off Adivan. She actually was in the hospital last summer due to not feeling well and it was high blood pressure something she never had before. Just makes me wonder if there should have been closer monitoring of the situation even though she is stubborn and scared for medical tsting...took her over 1 year to get her annual bloodwork done.


 dragonfly welcome I am also a fellow crohnie and look after dad with AD.......... I would really suggesst getting her into that neuro no matter what it takes to have her properly assessed and dx I do know it is heartbreaking and very difficult to do Know you are not alone Email me if you care to talk more on this plz Take care and try and have a good day Huggs to your Grandma ......... Come here and VENT all you want read other threads ect and of course check out the resources at side God Bless LYN


 Yes I have seen your posts and I know to well how rough you are having it ......... I am sure you can ask them to please have a consult with a nueorologist at the NH she is in by making this request to head of Nursing in writing or the one caring for her when you see her make sure you get name of Nurses caring for her.like I said PUT this in writing that you want her to be seen by a Nuerologist I know here in Ontario they are automatically......... I do so hope she is not on the ativan still that is a really bad med for AD imho as well there are many more out there for her to take Let us know how you make out LYN


 You can take her to any Dr you choose.Yes they have thier own Dr at the NH but you can still take her to a Neurologist,then the 2 Drs can confer whats going on.


 Yes thatys true you can have her checked by a couple and the NH one as well Please do let us know whats going on Thanks Snowy once again........


 I was dx with Alzheimer's 10 yrs ago,but this past December the Drs say VaD(vascular dementia),which caused by less bloodflow to the brain.


 Ativan is NOT the best medication for anyone with dementia.It can make things appear worse. I suggest she see a Neurologist for testing.Sounds like it's Vascular Dementia but then I'm not a Dr.


 WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA Dementia means the symptoms of deterioration of intellectual abilities resulting from an unspecified disease or disorder of the brain.The changes can affect thinking, memory and reasoning, and may occur gradually or quickly. Memory loss alone is not always a sign of dementia But memory loss with other form of cognitive impairment is an indicator that dementia is occuring. Alzheimer's Disease is one disese that causes dementiaMany other illnesses or syndrome can also cause dementia like Parkinson's Disease, stroke or even dehydration. It's a brain disease which affect the area of the brain that contorl memory, logical thinking and personality. The brain become smaller, cavities within the brain containingfluid become enlarge. more...on next posting


 HOw does one go about getting her a neurologist if she is now in a nursing home? My mother told me that she will be assigned a GP there and no longer have her GP who she has been seeing for years (her GP is 73). I am going to attempt to visit her this weekend depending how I feel will determine when and for how long, I am sure you have seen my recent health Sx posts on the CD site Howlyncat. This year so much is happening so fast with my family I sont know how we all havent cracked yet. Getting her to any docotr has been a struggle more so after her breast cancer Dx back in 1998, she has been cancer free since then but after she was Dx she has never been the same woman as before. Hopefully as she adjusts to the nursing home she will eat again (she decided to eat on and off while in the hospital) she just got there yesterday. My grandfather is going over everyday to be with her and will go to mass at the nursing home as opposed to their regular church. This nursing home is one of the top rated in the state just wish it wasnt $ 90,000 a year or at least for that price her meds, cable and local phone should be included. She has to get her own tv there but at least they supplu a bed and a place for clothes and they do not allow patients to stay in PJs all day which is good considering for the last year or so she would wear her nightgown under her clothes (she would rarely wear pants except holidays she is more of a skirt wearing woman)


 My mom informed me after asking about a nuro that they will have a consult at the NH for her


 Good to know tyvm for that info I will pass that along to my mom."
1 step forward 3 steps back,"Hello all, When my mom left the nursing home yesterday she was able to get my nan to eat 1/3 to 1/2 of her dinner. At about 9pm last night she got a phone call saying that my nan fell from the chair she was in and had some abrasions. No one knows if she was getting up, slid out of the chair (at times she slouches down in the chair) or what. When my mom said goodnight to her last night she noticed her body felt slightly warm but figured maybe it was from eating. The nurses took her temp last night and it was 101.4 and her oxygen was low so they placed her on oxygen. They were going to do a chest x-ray, bloodwork, and a urince C & S to see if it is from the UTI that she was treated with Cipro for. Needless to say the Cipro gave her a systemic yeast infection. This morning her temp was 101.3 there is so much stress going on right nnow its tough to handle. as in me recovering from 3 intestinal surgeries since February all with complications, trying to waen myself off of fentanyl pain patches under my drs care as well as lowering my dose of elavil (used for migraine prevention), both my car and husbands car need to be repaired, temporary disability screwed up and now I am waiting foe over 500 in money from them especially since I pay quite a few large bills within the month rent, electric, gas, cell phone (for 2 phones), cable/internet/home phone, car insurance, life insurance, auto insurance not to mention dealing with all the medical bills. I was dbl covered prior to my surgeries after being out 1 month at work I had to pay full or drop it and my husbands insurance never said I needed a letter of termination from my insurance so they would pick up as primary....sorry I digressed a lot","The Rocephin should do the trick.


 D Sorry bout your nan.....Snowy is right the Rochephin should work well and help her out getting rid of this pneumonia YES you have to relax you have CD as we all know and the stress is going to do you in and you know that OMG it does sound like you are going thru H*** and back hun BUT still I know its easier said then done you have to get thru these stressors before you wind up in hospital yourself Do you take anything for Anxiety or if not would your doc give it to you ?? Please let me know if there is anything I can do I feel so helpless at times when PPL are in the situations they are When your nan fell was she x rayed or did they not figure that was warranted ? Please know you are thought about and I do hope things get settled real soon for you and your nan is feeling better......... Luvs LYN


 Just heard from my mom who spoke with the nurses at the NH my nan now has pneumonia in both lungs, they are giving her rocephen IM and they say she should be doing better by monday in that respect.


 Stress...Stress...If you have moment take a deep breath and contemplate. Close your eyes and relax. This way you can think better and organized your idea. Set your priorities and start from here. Your situation is a tough one.But don't be overwhelmed with problems. Be on the top of everything. What happen to your grandma happen to most of the residents. In most cases, CNA's are working with 10 to 14 residents. They don't have enough time to attend to the needs of everybody. Accidents happen that they know how it happened and why it happenend, because nobody is with her. I'm sorry to what's happening to your grandma. Just stay cool and everything will be okay. I hopoe you the best and for your grandma."

Increased Oxygen Levels May Help Slow Down AD /Research Studies,"**There is much discussion and some belief that more oxygen to the brain and also the health of the Cardiovascular system may HELP slow down AD in some ppl** YOUR input appreciated as well Hypoxia -- low blood-oxygen levels -- ""does a lot of things to the brain,"" Nixon said. ""It has a lot of effects on brain function other than what is being described here. There should be at least some consideration of the broader context -- that hypoxia itself is a cause of impairment."" Nevertheless, Nixon said, the report ""is an interesting additional link that has not been appreciated before between hypoxia and this metabolic pathway."" Nixon and Song did agree on one point. ""The study reinforces another message that has emerged in recent years -- that the health of the cardiovascular system is very important for the health of the brain,"" Nixon said. ""The things one does to promote the health of the cardiovascular system are going to help the brain when it is challenged in Alzheimer's disease. Lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise are also an edge against hypoxia."" Song concurred. ""If we can improve blood flow to the brain, maybe we can help slow Alzheimer's progression. This report provides the mechanics for that. Increasing blood flow for the heart also helps slow Alzheimer's disease,"" he said. This has been out and about for some time now BUT they are really pushing this more with the alarming rate of AD in the world ........", 
things not looking great,"Hi everyone, On friday they Dx my nan with pneumonia. They started her on IV antibiotcs. Later thet night my mom called me and my great uncle passed away unexpectedly at home from a probable heart attack (my nans brother in law). Just to add to the family stress. I called my mom this morning and was tols she took today and tomorrow off and she had been planning on going in today since the wake is 5-8 tonight which doesnt conflict with her work schedule. I called the her at home and informed me that the NH called last night that my nan isnt doing well. They went down to the NH and it was never written anywhere but her wishes are that she is a DNR. Her pneumonia is getting worse she was all mucusy and having a very hard time breating. My papa signed the DNR order last night which was very hard for him to do. If they were ever to do pulmonary compressions that would kill her anyway. Just the hand my mom held during one of her anxiety attacks caused there to be bruising on her hand. They mentioned Hospice (which they also have at the NH since it is part of a hospital in the state). They are treating her with morphine for the pain and they had her in a reclining chair (they have a cushioned bar that goes across so they cannot fall out) behind the desk last night. My family finally left at 2 this morning. They said that there they have had people in hospice for over 3 yrs so it doesnt mean she will definitly pass tomorrow. My other great uncle (papas oldest bother) is in ICU they finally found the illness that is causing his reflexes such as swallowing, talking and breathing to not work. They do have a treatment for what he has but he isnt responding as well as they thought. My joints from my CD are so bad right now I am walking like gorilla and even though I had intestinal surgery recently I am spending lots of time having D...had to vent and really stressed.","Hi there Wow I dont know how you are managing all this and my heart is definitely going out to you ,your mom and nan ........Papa and dad This sounds sooo much akin to what happened with my Mom it is really kinda taking me back Mom was only 68 pds when she passed and had pneumonia as well .........although the IV meds may help your nan and if they are talking about putting her in Hospice I am sure that like you said it wont be today nor tomorrow I remember the DNR's all too well in places I worked and the one I owned I always felt sad but then I realized that it would most likely be for the best ......these ppl had un TX cancers and or other DD that left them,families and docs no other option really and they had to have it put on the Kardex definitely I am sure it had to have been hell for your Papa last night ......I am so sorry I am also so saddened by the other unexpected death of your great uncle It always seems to me that stress begets stress more times than not and I do understand what YOU have to be going thru with this and the CD it has to be playing such havoc on your body and the DD...............as well as the rest of family........their sadness and sorrow comes into this so much as you know I am glad you seem to have such a close knit family that is so supportive Please let me know how things go hun and know my heart thoughts and prayers are with you and all of your family at this time .......... God Bless LYN


 Hospice care focuses mainly on pain management and comfort. This is not to extend life. Hospice is reserved for people who have less than six months to live. But it doesn't mean that you'll be dying within this given period. You can be a hospice for several years due to ups and down of your condition. And if you recover, you can withdraw from being hospice anytime. In order to be eligible for hospice care, guidelines require at least one dementia-related medical complications such as: aspiration pneumonia, sepsis or severe infections, Upper urinary tract infection, bedsores and severe weight loss.


 When my parents left today to go to my great uncle's wake they basically explained that they are doing the Hospice more for my Papa rather than my nan. My mother basically was told they dont expect her to live long enough for hospice maybe tonight or tomorrow is when my mom said. I am unsure if they gave her that time frame or that is what she assumed after hearing about doing the hospice more for my papa who is still in denial and thinks she looks well. I guess Hospice also helps with grief as well from what I gather.


 Today she was comfortable early in the day. My family went there after the funeral (I now have some sort of throat bug, white patches etc had this last month and went away on its own but no need to bring more sickness to my nana). Her oxygen level without the nasal canula was below 80% (I am unsure what % exactly). Still when no one is there visiting her they move her in that chair near the nurses desk. My mom was sittin on the bed with her the last time I called her (my nan didnt want a phone set up so I just call my moms cell and get info that way) and had to hold her hand since nan was removing the nasal canula otherwise. As of this afternoon she is spitting her pills out whether she is refusing them or unable to really swallow no one knows. Now she is getting her adivan and morphine IV, I guess since hospice is setting her up tomorrow they figure adivan is fine at this point now. Last night my mom held her cell up to nana so I could talk to her she was sleeping but the nurses said she could still hear us. Tonight she was awake when I called and I spoke with her, my mom had to tell me what nan said due to her being soft spoken and weak. I know it wont be long now but as long as the last thing I say to her is that my husband and I love her that makes me a little more at peace. When I was there Sunday she was so out of it she didnt know who was there, I remember kissing her forhead when I left but couldnt recall telling her I love her, my mom reassured me that I did but I feel better now that she heard me and even tho I couldnt understand her she said she loves us too. I just keep thin king as of Sept 4th I am back at work after being on TDI since February, they already took my employee discount away and fear they will not pay me for bereavement. My husbands job does not allow for spouses grandparents either. Thank you for all the prayers Stef


 Steph I am always thinking of you and what you and your family is going thru right now NO it does not mean she will be gone within 6 mths but yes it is for keeping thm comfy and w/o pain The ppl I have met in my career working in Hospic's have Empathy and plenty of love and a BIG heart of caring for those in the hospice I tis a very difficult place to be in as well as to work in one No matter the "" Golden Rule"" of NOT getting close to your patients .......YOU do ....I was the worst for this believe me and yes it broke my heart with each one passing BUT I had made memories with them whether it was just brushing their long hair ......putting lotion and or make up on them ...... Doing the men's ties all the shaves .......you name it I did it I never EVER expected anymore from my employees that I WOULD not do myself ...... I sure hope you can get some rest and try to keep in your mind and heart that ppl do really care about you and your wonderful Nan God Bless and Keep You's All in His Arms ......... Luvs LYN"
well we figured out why my nana has been shaking lots the last couple of days,"Hello everyone, It really makes you wonder how much the nurses and doctors that prescribe Rxs in nursing homes read patients charts. My nan has recently been Dx with AD and placed in the nursing home since thursday. She has been taking adivan for 19 years and recently was taking 3 a day. I know this is bad for people with AD but at the nursing home they just stopped giving it to her altogether. After my mom talked to the head nurse she informed her about the adivan dose she had been on. Luckily my papa had 1 with him, the nurse said give it to her but dont tell anyone I said that and she was going to get adivan approved for her tomorrow. They should cut her down slowly not just stop after the lebgth of time and dosage she was on. My papa doesnt understand that my mom is not going to go over there everyday until 7pm or so, she explained her job, family, house, dogs etc. My nan understands that she cannot continue to go over there daily forever better than my papa. She is going to continue to go for a little bit until she is a bit more settled. Dinner time came and papa told my om okay you go help her and she said no you have to get use to it cause I wont be here everynight. She told the nurses ground (not puree) food would be best at the moment since her bottom dentures she says are bothering the inside of her mouth. She had complained of that in the past as well. I just dont understand how they did not see that she had been on the amount of adivan and length of time. Soon after she took it she relaxed and stopped shaking a bit.","While my mom was at the NH Sunday or Monday she went in her room (my nan usually is in the sitting room most of the day watching TV with papa) and looked on her cork board. Luckily she did because my papa didnt see that there was a paper about the monthly family meeting. The meeting was today so my mom went to work early left for the meeting and is now back at work. My mom wrote a letter of things that have been going on tremors, pain in her mouth etc. She included her past meds, doses and length of years on them. I guess in the hospital they took her off of her Paxil in about 3 days, she had been on that for about 8 years. That could be contributing to the tremors she also talked about the adivan and they said you can stop that cold turkey...not her though since she had a nervous breakdown due to hypocondria after her mom passed in 1988. She brought the oral pain to their attention and my nan while at home use to take about 1 hour for oral hygene at night and probably 15 mins in the am (denture cleaning was done at night) She would brush her remaining teeth, floss use the water pic she had 1 case for the top dentures and 1 for the bottom ones. We found out that no one has brushed her teeth (she has always needed sensodyne(sp?) toothpaste as well) eithr there nor in the hospital she has teeth only on the bottom. My mom use to be a dental assistant for years until arthritis was affecting her hands. My mom went gently brushing and rinsing which my nan said hurt but my mom told her that is normal and will get better the more it is done. The Physical therapist said thatr she does not have the tremors while walking. My mother expressed concern learning that there are seizures that can occur and the patient is aware of them and since she is newly Dx with seizures she also brought that to their attention. I forget many of the other things my mom informed me of even though it was just a short while ago...I am still on pain meds from my 3 intestinal surgeries that I have had this year. They do have an account that family can put money in so that if the patient wants the hair cut or a manicure the family doesnt have to go down there each time. The haircuts include washing cutting setting and styling for $ 18.00 This next part is not AD related just responding to Howlyncat Lyn, as for my CD I started flaring about this time last year Dr kept saying you are having D and you typically have C when you flare so it has to be a virus, this kept on for months. In january I had a CTE which confirmed the flare and he just wanted to keep meds as they were...every time I actually got off the pred 2 weeks later the symptoms were back. In Feb I had emergency resection ileum perforated also a fistula from intestine to intestine was removed (I had no idea I had one), complications arose, toxic megacolon, abscesses etc, 2nd Sx was 1 week later had temp ostomy done dumb resident got feces in my incision claimed she didnt need to flush it...wound got infected got wound vac, got readmitted to the hospital 2 more times in March due to abscesses, while my Dr was on vacation his assoc had a drain placed next day no drainage so they pulled the drain. Readmitted first time abscess was back, next day ct revealed it was gone went home a week later. Readmitted 1 week later abscess was back, got drain placed the next day determined abscess made fistula to stoma and incision and was being sucked out by wound vac. Abscess would not stop producing fluid once it got to be between 20 cc and 10 cc a day it no longer decreased in amount. Reversal was done 4 months post op of ostomy due to abscess issues. Five procedures were done in that Sx he had an assoc assist rather than an intern due to the complexity of it. They removed more of both intestines, removed the abscess, reversed the ostomy, removed multiple adhesions, and had to scrape the internal abdominal walls due to inflamation and infection from the abscesses. It has been 7 weeks since that surgery & have a localized infection in the incision but it is superficial so I just have to pack a corner of gauze in it so it wont heal the infection inside...and finally cutting down off of the Fentanyl patches, I have a high tolerance for pain meds and the Oxycontim was not staying in my system long enough to even begin to work (with ostomy I was still able to read the writing on the pill while in the bag), after reversal it was a hope that it would stay in longer but it just would come out when I would use the bathroom. I had to call my GI this week my joints are swollen and still having abd discomfort he suggested waiting another week or 2 (he put me back on pentasa to try to delay more CD) before placing me back on entocort for a short burst and see if things subside on low residue again and due to all of the stress. Hopefully it will stop on its own, my belly was good until I ate some raw veggies and an orange last week. He also told me that my iron is low ( I have not been anemic in a long time but probably due to my Sx (plus I cannot eat too much red meat without it bothering my stomach...at least before Sx that happened) so I started back on iron pills yesterday he also said that there are some liver changes but he was not worried about that. I wonder if that has to do with the pain meds that i have been on since February. I just called my surgeon this week to mail me a script for the 25mcg patches so that I can switch to that this weekend I have 5 more of the 50mcg but my TDI runs out the end of this month and my husband wont let me drive while I have the pain meds in me. Therefore to return to work I need to get off the pathces (and obviously have the ok from the Dr). I have had the withdrawal when I went down to the 50 from 75mcg ( I started the fentanyl in mid april and jut placed my 5th 50mcg on last night ...they are used for 72 hrs). I am to change the patch again friday and rather do it while I will have someone else at home whiel I have the withdrawals. My nan's symptoms started getting worse about 1 week after I was discharged from the hospital...needless to say its been a heck of a year. Both my mom and I are only children so I cant even imagine how she is staying held together, just lots of prayers and family support I guess....and some xanax now and again but not daily or even weekly at times.


 THis should all have been in her records on admittance and it will all have to be straightened out Someone with all the knowledge of your G's meds foods likes dislikes ect HAS to do the paperwork with the nurses or sit at home and do one up hotocopy it and give to head nurse NO you are totally right she was going thru withdrawal I would say .......from the ativan ....... I am praying that this will all work out for you dragon as it is not helping your CD either ......I have a cream I use for the sores I get from dentures and crohns in mouth clears them right up it is called * Oracort* I am sure you have heard of it ....ask them for something for her When is she expected to stay there full time I am praying and thinking about you all Luvs N God Bless LYN

for all you caregivers out there,"Mrs mac .......I did the same as you did for many yrs ,in fact owned my own retirement home here in Ontario ...........Mom worked in the office (also a geriatric nurse ) and my Dad in the kitchen with both brothers working there as well .......one is a male nurse the other a maintenance man for the building...........so I do know what it is like to be able to go home after the shift BUT I always got so darn close with the patients anyways so I still would worry about them especially those without family..........This is a very difficult thing to do but I get many rewards doing it and I feel I am the better of all my siblings to do this as they just want to put parents in home and I will not allow this ........at least not with breath in my body.........thank you for taking the time to recognise the ""caregiver"".........God Bless .....Lyn","I was a full time CNA for 30 yrs caring for the eldely,with & without AD.It's a hard job.


 This is a GREAT thread. God Bless anyone who caretakes for their own family or friends. I was a CNA also and a senior advocate. I'd go to the Nursing Home on my days off to be sure they got fed O.K. and got put to bed 'gently'. My favorite patients were the Alzheimer patients, but if my own Dad developed it, it would just about kill me from a broken heart. I just couldn't bare if he got it. I pray all the time that he'll pass, in his sleep and with his mind in tact. He's a very young and full of vigor 87, very healthy and on no meds at all. He even went to Italy with his sweetheart this last Sept. So although I loved caring for my patients, I would find it unbearable to see my own family member or friend go through it. So I very deeply admire those family members or friends, who caretake their own loved ones. Kudos indeed. God Bless all of you. Ann


 Hi crohns hubby, my hat goes of to you dear sir. it's never easy for the husband to be the caregiver but you men never fail to amaze me. you see my husband is my main caregiver & is absolutely wonderful. I have cirhosis from prescript ion drugs. It can be heartbreaking for both sides. But our spouses can be our biggest support & reason to keep going . Keep up the good work & know that all you caregivers are so greatly appreciated & loved.later....


 Dear crohnsHubby, Thank you so much for your post. I'll be praying for ALL of you wonderful people. You said, something so deeply profound in your post, I'll probably remember it forever now. You said, """"""...it does break her heart to see them like this but at least she is still making memories with them"""""" ""But at least she is still making memories with them !"" Wow. That is so intense a love. You've changed my perspective from my earlier post here today. Thank You so much. I'm sort of speechless right now, but I thank you again and wish Lyn health, and yourself and strength to the household. God Bless you all. Ann


 As my hubby said I would be reading these posts lol.......I look at it this way my parents looked after me changed my soiled diapers ,fed me bathed me, they did it all and I remember it was done with LOVE........They never made me feel that it was a ""job"" for them to do all they could for us kids ,but more like an adventure .....learning as we grew,by our mistakes and theirs.......we were always treated as ""gifts""........not saying we didnt get the switch once in awhile cuz we did for sure lol.......thats why it hurts me so much that my siblings cannot and will not take the time to be with them or do things with them ,and 3 out of 4 of us live right here here in town ( 5 min away).........but I am getting so many wonderful silly and some really funny memories with both my parents that they wont ever have ..........it is their loss .....our daughter goes over and listens to Papa talk about the ""old days over and over"" and does not complain.........she knows what is going on I have taught her all about AD and she grew up in a retirement home environment.............Empathy is one of Cait's most beautiful qualities and for that I am so thankful.........Yes it can be a hard job at times but again they didnt stop their ""job"" with us kids right so I feel I will be the one that wins in the end myself my hubby/daughter........we love doing what we do and if there comes a time when Cait cannot face seeing her Nana and Papa like they are I will understand..........it is hard for me so I know it has to be for her as well ......She loves coming home and telling us stories of things they did while she was there and she is grinning from ear to ear with a sparkle in her eyes .........sometimes a few tears ........but she carries on and she to has memories that no one else will ever have and that is of their own making ........I do feel bad for those that cannot for whatever reason keep their loved ones at home with them and I dont judge them either, it is rewarding but it is also very hard to do 24/7.......Thank you for all your kind words and the warmth of your posts ......it means so much to me and all the other caregivers out there .........God Bless ......Lyn

 Please always remember that you as the Caregiver also needs to be having time for your self and keeping healty as well If you are not healthy then who would look after them right So please I ask you to really do a though inventory of your needs as well and have it so you are healthy emotionally and physically Take a couple hours off and do something for YOU YOU really do deserve it My hats are off to all those that do the caregiving for their loved ones at home ...... I also will say that if you are not able to do it alone perhaps hire a person check everything out first though full bkgd on them and who they have had in care before ect ect ...police check as well If for some reason the time has come to place the loved one in a NH or Retirment Home Check out the thread on the NH's and also ask for full disclosure and reports on that home Just because they may cost alot doesnt mean a thing you need to know what type of care and ppl there will be there for your loved one......meals, bedchecks, Activities ,safety features in bathrooms ....the whole nine yards Theses are your most precious gifts so please do it for them And please dont feel that "" guilt"" Most will and it is a heavy feeling to carry around so let it go you did what you could for so long and now things have to change for whatever reason........You tried and thats what is important IMHO at least you did try.........

 I'm a caregiver unti now, not a family caregiver, but an employee. You're right. Lyn. It's not easy to be a caregiver. You must have patience and compassion to the elderly. It must come from the heart and you're not doing this just because of money. You must be sincere and compassionate. If you don;t have this qualities, caregivng job is not for you. This might end up in abuse and neglect."

 VERY well stated G Padraig............


 HI Linda Yes it is appalling what she has been put thru Definitely needs her HW family ..........


 Again for Lyn, Padraig and Linda, Last message went through, so I'll try again. Yesterday was my husband's move to Crofton Manor. I was up late the night before, getting the furniture marked and ready. Two young boys came with a moving van, and I asked them if a cheque was okay, or did they take MasterCard? They said they would rather have cash; that way, I could avoid paying GST. After telling them that I would rather pay the GST, they went upstairs and went on with the job. When it came time to pay, after phoning their boss, they would not accept the cheque for $290.00. I told them that even though I had spoken to their boss three times, this was the first I'd ever heard it had to be cash. I said I had $120.00 cash on hand, and they could have the balance in a cheque. They wanted me to get in their truck; they would drive me to the nearest bank machine, and I could withdraw the money and take a cab home. I told them I had to pick my husband up at the hosptial and wouldn't do it. They drove away in their truck with the furniture. I phoned the cops; they said it was a civil matter. Picked up husband, arrived at Crofton Manor about an hour later. The truck was there. But now the price had jumped to $390.00. I said to forget about it. They had apparently been badgering the staff at Crofton to pay, because the staff were all VERY UPSET. It seemed the better part of discretion, for future relationships with Crofton, to pay and get the furniture unloaded and the truck off the premises. Which I did. They drove off, keeping one armchair, one footstool, one table and one printer. I phoned the local paper (Courier) that had taken the ad to tell them the business was not reputable; then I phoned a friend of mine who works in the auditing department of the Income Tax Department, telling her that I thought the company was trying to avoid declaring their income for tax purposes. Backtrack to when I picked up my husband at the first hospital. He didn't want to leave. I had to phone Crofton to assure him that here was room waiting for him. Spent 5 hours with my husband, getting him settled, arrived home wiped out, ready for bed. His son phoned (he must have used another phone because I've blocked his number; this is his 3rd attempt this week - he wants to know when I'm going to move into Crofton). As soon as he said his name and, ""I want to check up...."" I hung up, pulled the plug on the phone and went to bed. Fastforward to this afternoon. I arrived at my husband's room at 1:30 p.m. and was trying to hook up a phone for him when in came his ex-wife. Didn't say a word to me but went right over to my husband (of 27 years!) to kiss him. He said, ""Would you mind coming back another time to visit? I have a visitor here."" ""Oh."" ""Maybe tomorrow? Would that be all right with you? ""Oh, yes. All right. How do you like it here, E.?"" ""Not much."" ""No, of course, you don't. You should be in your own home."" Whereupon I stood up, headed for the door, intending to ask a nurse for help to get rid of ex. She said, ""Mary, what time do you want me to come back tomorrow?"" ""It doesn't matter to me, but E. has asked you to leave now. He doesn't want to have more than one visitor at a time."" ""Well, I can come back tomorrow. What time would be all right with you?"" ""I don't care. But I want you to go now, as E. has already asked."" Door closes behind her. One minute later, a knock. it's Nancy, a neighbour, goes to the same church and had helped me take care of Eric when he was home. I almost fell into her arms at seeing a friendly face. We all sat and chatted for about 10 minutes.. Knock on the door. I went. It was E.s' son. I said, ""Would you mind waiting outside for about 10 minutes?"" He said, ""I want to talk to you, Mary."" I said, ""I have nothing to say to you"" and closed the door. Went back to sit with Nancy and E. Put on the call light for the nurse. Few minutes later, very loud knocking. I started to get up. Eric told me that he would handle it. From what I could hear from the open door, he told the son that the family was putting pressure on Mary, and he wanted it stopped. Son put up a defense. E. said, ""Maybe not you, but the rest of the family are, and Mary feels it as pressure."" The gist was that it was soft pedaling on E.'s part but with enough firmness to get the message across. Son went away, although I learned later that he went to talk to the nursing manager about it. Nurse came about 10 minutes later. I went to the nursing manager before I left to say that this was upsetting to E., to be told he should be at home. The nursing manager said he would check in on E. whenever the family visited. Told mu husband that I would not be visiting him tomorrow before checking with him by phone to see if ex-wife and son and come and gone. May skip it altogether, though. I'm fair frazzled. I'm planning to go to teh Sunshine Coast next Wednesday after class for about 5 days. Love to you all, Mary


 Hi Mary, I find it so depressing to read what you're being put through. Has the ex-wife or son any idea about what the future holds for a loved one with Alzheimer's? What they are doing, is nothing short of playing very cruel mind games on the person they profess to love. In my book they are a very sad, sad lot. The Alzheimer's road is rocky enough for you and your husband to travel without obstructions being placed in the way. Will they be there futher down that road, should your husband longer be able to walk of talk? You appear to have managed things well for a lady of your age on her own and it's as well you have a good friend to support you. It's only a shame you don't have a strapping young man to put the fear of God into to these people taking advantage of you. Sorry, but it's things like you've been put through that make me explode with rage. It's good to know you're taking a break, a time to ponder calmly about your situation and how best to maintain control of it. Seems to me it's a mind game and you hold the strongest cards. Stay strong, you are in my thoughts and prayers, God bless. Padraig


 Hello dear Mary, I just accidentally stumbled upon this thread and was obviously appalled at what has been going on. The move alone---- without all the myriad of interferences from shady furniture movers, ex-wife, family telling all it would be better had you kept your husband at home----- would have been more than plenty to deal with. I am so sorry you had to go through that. I hope upon hope that things have settled down now and that you got that well deserved and needed rest, mini-vacation. Just remember that you carefully and thoughtfully made the decision you did with your husband's best welfare in mind always, and that it was a good decision for both of you. I so wish we could develop a kind of tunnel vision and extremely selective hearing when things like this happen so when you were in his room you didn't see the ex-wife, hear her or the others talking, and instead just saw the one important person in that room you wanted and needed to see. Keep strong, you are handling so much and although you must be so exhausted you have done such a wonderful job of tracking down the furniture movers, reporting them in a way that hopefully they will be uable to scam anyone else again, finding a great place for your husband, getting him moved and settled.............and are still sane enough and capable of writing coherently!! I think about you and hope the best always always always!! Linda"
My Dad has Alzheimer's will I have that too?,This is the worry of children who's parents had AD. To make this clear and specific doctors and researchers have categorized Alzheimer's into three types : * EARLY-ONSET DEMENTIA : Less than 10 percent of all AD patients have this type. These are individuals diagnosed with the disease before age 65. Adults with Down Syndrome are at risk and often the symptoms appear in their mid to late 40s or early 50s. * LATE-ONSET DEMENTIA : This is the most common form of AD. It occurs after age 65. It strikes almost half of all people over the age of 85. This might or might not be hereditary. Late-onset dementia is also called SPORADIC Alzheimer's Disease. * FAMILIAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE : This is entirely inherited. Families of at least 2 generations can be documented to have AD. But this is extremely rare. It is less than 1 percent of all cases of AD. Since the most common AD is late-onset dementia it doesn't mean that if one member of the family has AD you will have the disease too. Just keep your brain cells healthy and optimized thru proper nutritions and exercises. Keep your brain stimulated.,"I often wonder if my great grandmother had AD. She was placed in a nursing home after a severe stroke, she refused any type of rehabilitation. She was placed at the nursing home while my mother was pregnant with me. We visited her often and she passed away in the late 80's (I was around 10 or so when she passed if I recall correctly... it has been a while now and I was very young, it was after 1987 though I remember that much). Towards the end she would not recognize me had trouble recognizing my mom but did after a short time. The nursing home she was in wasnt great the aroma of urine would smack you in the face as soon as the doors opened. She would sit in her own urine for at least an hour at times. It is hard to say if she has AD since there was history of strokes whether she had more that we were unaware of or if it was AD we will never know. This would help to know being that my grandma is now in a nursing home with AD.


 Dragon....your gradma can have neuological testing done and assessed for AD while in the NH If it were I I would demand it .....but thats me I wish you all the best friend and continue to post plz ....... This is not really deemed hereditary so like was posted keep your brain cells stimulated and you will do okay I know you will LUVS LYN


 Some people can have VaD & Alzheimer's.


 THanks for the great input MM I believe there is alot of fear in children of those with this DD that they will end up getting it and yes KEEP BRAIN CELLS STIMULATED Good thread Luvs LYN


 I asked my mother to live with me because I am afraid putting her in a nursing hope can affect her mentally and make her vulnerable to Alzheimer's.


 Stroke can cause dementia which is di fferent from Alzheimer's Disease. They aren't interchangeably. Many of the things that can cause dementia are treatable, even potentially curable. Just be active and keep keep your healthy lifestyle and you'll be fine.


 Yes so true Snowy Thanks for your input as always LYN ** How is Larry doing**"
Quick Question,I just was informed that my brother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I know nothing about it. Is there a test that confirms it. How is it diagnosed? Thanks for any answers.,"Thank you so much Tammy, that's I was thinking that there was no test for it, that they had to rule out other things first. My brother will be 60 next month. He has cirrohsis of the liver and lung cancer. I suspect that his ammonia levels may have started to rise is what maybe causing his confusion. He lives couple of states away from me with another brother and sister. My sister thinks that doctors walk on water. I don't hold the same view point. So needless to say we bump heads on health issues. I am praying that he does not have alzheimer's on top of the other things that are wrong with him. Thank you again Tammy and if he does have it I certainly will be back here for education and support.


 Thanks SnowyLynne, I am getting ready to call my sister in a little bit so that info will come in handy. So glad that your are doing so well.


 Pink as Snowy said she was put thru a battery of tests then given the AD DX then was given Vascular Dementai DX I have never known a woman that is still going as strong as our Snowy..........God Bless her.......... I do hope all will work out for your brother and his caregiving after ......... PLEASE feel free to pop in and join our lil family here .......... Support for this DD is greatly needed by those that are losing their loved ones to it I lost Mom already and Dad is going quickly.......... Stay with us plz Sorry I was not around yesterday resting from pneumonia but feeling lots better today God Bless .......... Congrats on your new Mod position as well ....you'll love it Luvs LYN


 Glad to hear it is not AD Hoping your visit goes great for all Come back anytime LYN


 Hello Pink, I am sorry about your recent news. May I ask, how old is your brother? TO answer your question, there is no single test that can or will diagnose Alzheimer's. Doctors will look at a number of different things about the patient, such as language and problem solving skills, and ability to think. They will also do other tests to rule out any other health issues. They will of course, do a blood work up, and maybe even brain scans. Alzheimer's, to the best of my knowlledge, is not a super easy diagnosis. Mainly because it's not like you can do a blood test and say ""yep, this man has Alzheimer's."" Ya know? I don't know how involved you will be in your brothers life, as I don't know your whole life story, but if you need support during this, please don't hesitate to come here. Alzheimer's is a tough thing to deal with, not only for the patient, but also for the family and friends who have the sad job of watching. Wishing you all the best!


 I was given a 5 hour battery of tests,EEG,EKG,MRI Spinal Tap.I was diagnosed with AD at age 57,but Last Dec.I was still doing so well I had different testing done & they came up with vascular Dementia.I'm 67 now & still doing very well.


 Stay strong Pink...We are here for you!!! Wishing you and your brother, all the best. I am sorry to hear he has so much going on already! You will be in my prayers...as will he, and the rest of your family as well.


 Well I finally was able to get a hold of my sister. And no, my brother was not diagnosed with alzheimers. All that was said was that she thought that he was acting like he may have alzheimers and by the time the story got to me through a couple of other family members it got twisted. I even talked with my brother who is sick and yes he is very sick but doing as well as he can given his circumstances. I am going to visit them at Christmastime. I hope that he is up for a visit then. Thanks again for all of your kind words and education on alzheimer's. Hope everyone is fine. Take care."
Head Pain,"For the past year, I have been having sharp pain on the right side of my head. I do not have headaches but sensations as if I am going to get a headache. The pressure on my right side of my head comes and goes. I tend to forget things a lot. Should I be concerned about this. Is there a possibility that I will have Alzheimer’s disease or a tumor in the near future? What exams should I request from my doctor?","Hoping to see you return here and get the answers or input ....... as well as any other support needed.... LYN


 Thanks Snowy for your inoput as always Luvs LYN


 HI there and welcome to HW I would suggesst that you really have a good talk to your doc about this it could be nothing BUT it may also be something that is treatable BTW ' I am 53 and I am forgeting many things lately but I do ot believe I have alzheimers..........even with both parents having it Your best bet would to see your family doc and then he may send you to a neuroologist Glad you found us here and hoping you continue to stay with us LYN

Personal Essay on Alzheimer's Disease,"Hello!

DIGNITY RESPECT and to be tx with the utmost care was my homes priority YES there are horrid places out there and some should be closed down In Canada we have the Adult Protection Agency akin to Childrens services come in and we are monitored closely Infractions are not taken lightly I had workers for doing the odd jobs and we also took them out on field trips to parks for pic nics and to a show in Toronto ......a belive old Musical they loved it I have been so depressed since the home was bought out from under me ( another story ) I had over 40 residents ( yes small amount) but to this day I can still tell you each ones fav food ,activity, birthday and all background info on them There are exceptions hun to your essay It is a fantastic essay though I am going to bump up the ""Check out Nursing homes thread "" so you can have a look .

IMO and many others in the feild of geriatrics this med is a no no for AD ppl it changes their brain pattern so makes the aggitation and anger worse ' I had to take moms Doc to task about this I hope Snowy answers this one as she knows what I am saying is the truth ****DID you check out ""NURSING HOME"" thread........ Please keep us posted go and talk to them about proper therapy for your mom as well she will not be able to move at all if this crap continues Yes move her .......


 Hi Sam, Your Mother is spot on there is no posible way any NH can give the care and attension, but most of all love to the unfortunate who are afflicted with ALZ. Who cleans nose, ears with cotton buds and brushes teeth daily? Who can make them feel wanted? There's no way I can ever forget the names of those gentle souls we left behind at that NH. When will we ever learn to shower love on those at the end of life as we do on those at the start. By being abandoned as a child it has given me an appreciation for the love of my wife, and for the loneliness some suffer. I'm one of the lucky ones because I enjoy caring and am fortunate to be fit enough to go it alone. Success fuels success, but I still always expect the unexpected. Good luck and God bless, Padraig


 What is this ""thread"" on nursing homes you are speaking of?? How do I locate it? My Mom is still being drugged, she seems to be getting weaker. She has lost at least 40 pounds now. she desperately tries to walk but has a difficult time. She tries to talk to us, can hardly open her eyes. We are trying to move her to another nursing home, however, it is not something that can be done overnight...... Just pray that we get her moved fast enough to where they will help her and put life back into her instead of draining it out......................... Thank you Doreen


 Doreen Did you check out the NH thread yet ?? Lyn


 Wordsmith Wondering if you would email me if you have a second Thanks LYN


 Bringing this Essay up for new members and older ones as well Great essay IMHO


 So rightly put MM Thanks for your input I thought and still believe this is a great essay ....... Take care LYN


 Thanks so much for sharing I have read some of it and can empathize with you quite often I looked after mom til she passed in March and now look after step dad My bkgrd is in Geriatric Nursing I hope you will stick around and add to the forum.......... You take care God Bless Lyn


 Thanks so much for the comments and for making the link work properly (didn't know how to do that!). Yes, there are bound to be exceptions but it seems that we as a family may have been somewhat unfortunate. The present home my father is in is considerably better than others we have encountered and we simply move ahead with it, although it's something of a balancing act sometimes! Just today my mother and I were remembering what my grandfather went through. We recalled visiting one day and discovering he was wearing socks, trousers, a pullover and nothing else - no vest or underwear. There are many other things like this I could have mentioned in the essay but the point in that section was not to whine on and on in a long list of problems but draw attention to unacceptable shortcomings with many (too many) nursing homes. We recalled too how a woman who verbally abused my grandmother was dismissed the following day. I do have a lot of respect for people such as you who espouse the personal touch and consider the well being and comfort of the resident to be of utmost importance. It’s refreshing to read of your commendable approach. I wish there were more like you! Sadly however it’s inevitable that the elderly should become a mere factor within a job specification and a crucial part of a profit-making process. In recent years here in the UK concerned bodies and the news media have issued reports and findings on the failings of nursing homes. Subjects covered include assault, malnutrition through neglect, excessive sedation, cruelty and worse. In general terms, and that includes nursing homes, many old people are suffering abuse today: “The figure of at least half a million older people experiencing some form of abuse [in England] at any point in time appears to offer the only estimate that is currently available. We are disappointed that the Department has not commissioned research to establish a more precise figure” (House of Commons Health Committee: Elder Abuse, 2003-04). I mentioned the excessive drugging of residents in my essay. A British political party has looked into this problem: “The report points to an increase in community prescript ions for antipsychotic drugs - up 6.2% between 1999 and 2002, an increase of 129,000 prescript ions. It also shows that two out of three GP practices have missed a government target to introduce six-month reviews of medication for all over 75s. These reviews were supposed to have been up and running since April.” Yes there are bound to be good nursing homes but it’s a fact that too many are failing the elderly and their relatives. Most people I talk to seem to take the meek but cunning approach when dealing with nursing home senior staff, which is so sad in a way, and I don’t believe I’ve ever met anyone who had a glowing report of any nursing home. But I’ve stressed in my essay the need for relatives to be cautious. It’s easy to jump to conclusions – it’s the nature of nursing homes to be unpleasant places at times and things may not be what they seem. There are many within the profession who are doing a fantastic job in very trying circumstances. I’m so sorry to hear about your loss and present difficulties. You come across as a person of strong character and determination and I trust that those excellent qualities will see you through. Regards Sam


 I need to respond to your essay on Alzheimers... This really hit home for me. My Mother was diagnosed with A.D. 9 years ago.... Thanks to the care from my Sister and my Mom's strong will, she has been kept in good health and almost frozen within the stage of A.D. where she knows who we are, kept walking all over the nursing home constantly (they wanted to put a meter on her to see how far she really walked each day), was always the first to get up and start clapping and dancing if someone played music, always smiling, laughing and loving people, wanting to go out all the time... Of course she could not shower alone, dress herself, toilet herself, etc... however, the rest was enough. Right up until Christmas of 2006 - the next day she fell at the nursing home and instantly my Mom was taken over by the A.D. demon.... As soon as they attempted to help her up off the floor she became combative, spitting, biting, kicking, hitting, pinching and cursing everyone out. This wonderful woman whom everyone loved, all the aides and nurses always told us she was her favorite resident. darn!! How fast that changed. Since December 31st she has been sent to a crisis center in an ambulance 4 times!!! Restrained by wrists, legs and chest to keep from hurting someone or herself. She cries all the time now. Cries out for Mama. She has been dehydrated, lost 20 pounds from not eating. So what do they do?? The nursing home keeps her drugged as they cannot handle her. My Sister and I arrive at 5 to 6 PM each evening with food to be sure she is eating, and to get her up walking around as she tries so hard to get up out of the geriatric chair just to walk .... They try to feed her, if she does or does not eat they then drug her up, by the time we get there, we have to struggle to get food and liquids down her, which is scary as I am afraid she may choke. We cannot even attempt to get her up and walking.


 Hi Wordsmith, having read your esssay it brought back awful memories of the year my wife spent in a NH. I was in daily conflict with the staff, and when I saw my wife had given up, I made the decision to sell our large home, for one in which I could manage the care of my wife alone. To this very day I refuse any help, in fact I refuse to accept the conventional treatment which is dished out to Alz patients in the NHS. There have been at least four times when the experts said she had little hope of survival. On the first of April it will be four years since I took her home. From just over five stone, she is now a healthy nearly 9 stone. Though she is incapable of movement or speech I take her out shopping and for walks. I have long since given up on the system, but will fight to get any medical attention she may require. Thank you for highlighting that which is all too common in what is meant to be a civilised society. I came on this site in the hope of helping others with 'My story my Wife'. Best wishes to you. Padraig


 Thank you all for your response... It is very sad how the people who are suffering with this disease are actucally neglected and pushed aside as if they do not matter. My Sister and I went again tonight, we tried to get there before they administered the adifan - however, they said she was too agitated to eat, so in order to feed her they had to medicate her. She did eat good for them, so that was a blessing. We got her out of the geriatric chair and she walked about 10 yards, even under the drugs she has that strong will to want to walk. We were even able to toilet her on the toilet, so she did not end up going in her diaper. The staff was shocked to see her walking. Her legs are starting to curl a little because they are not taking the time with her that she needs. We will be moving her from this nursing home, it may be a week or two, but until then I know I will try my best to get to her side every night and keep her on her feet for as long as I can. I am telling everyone I can about how this seems to be the ""normal"" with n.h.'s to drug them up and all - it makes me and everyone else sick to our stomachs. Thank you again Doreen


 I checked out the thread on nursing homes and it ties in with my general research, sad to say. My mother says time and time again that even the best of nursing home staff don't LOVE those they care for, so human nature being what it is... Relatives need to be firm and tactful, but it's hard to be on top of your game day after day when you're stressed and upset. Padraig, Doreen, I read you comments with interest. AD is a tough ask for all concerned but we have to press on, don't we. Best Regards, Sam


 Sam I am so happy you checked out that thread I am looking deperately for something simuliar here in Canada to post as well God Bless Lyn *** Butterfly Kisses G Padriag and Grama Jean I love you both dearly God Bless Lyn


 HI there I will put it back up for you okay it shows where NH are located and quality or lack of care ..... Lyn


 Doreen Have been wondering how you are doing hoping you were able to have mom moved to another facility Please let us know okay Lyn


 Just wondering where Doreen and Wordsmith are lately


 The essay is very true and it's sad to know that this is happening in some nursing homes. It's heart breaking to know that elderly are abused and neglected. Yes, if the resident is combative and agitated they are putting them in medication to calm them down. It's easier for them to sedate people than to deal with the actual problem. So one day you just see your loved one, totally out of reality, not knowing you, totally helpless. This is unacceptable but it happen.

Angry...Frustrated..No Compasion??????,"Hello, sister and fellow caregivers. I am terribly isolated and terribly angry in my caregiving for my mother, 81, who has had AZ for a few years now and is in the middle stage of it now. Sometimes I think that I will just blow up. I take my anger out on myself rather than on her, of course, because I am a dutiful and well-trained daughter. I am very troubled that I do not feel more love and compassion for her. However, that probably has to do with our long unhappy history together. My mother is in complete denial that she has AZ -- keeps saying that she'll be getting better soon and moving out on her own and getting her driver's license back, etc.. Similarly, she has been in complete denial all her life that she has bi-polar disorder -- which practically ruined her life (although she often was having a whale of a time) and irrevocably damaged mine. I have taken care of her (emotionally) for much of my life (I am an only child and my father is long gone) and now I continue to do so -- and soon I will be a pensioner myself!!! My mother has always been anxious and never happy and AZ is exaggerating these qualities in her. There seems to be nothing I can do, short of completely sacrificing my life to her needs, that could possibly make her happy. Horse I am SO ANGRY about all of it -- and especially about the way that it is ending -- in a long, drawn-out, painful removal from life with no recognition at the last of what was real -- her conditions, my life-long pain, etc.. I am so angry that I am rarely able to feel compassion for her -- except in a purely intellectual way -- and I fear that I am building up a load of regrets about my limited capacilty to nurture her through this final illness that will haunt me for the rest of my days. And then there is the case of my beloved friend, only 69 years old and so full of life and love and surrounded by family who love her, who was diagnosed with AZ only a year and a half ago and who is speeding rapidly down the slope away from us all. And I would give my right arm to have her back the way she was -- I am so full of grief at her going that I can hardly speak in her presence -- she is so dear to me. So this lack of compassion for my own mother -- this fury at her in her final denial (especially as I read the stories of people with AZ who, with grace, have come to terms with their illness) leaves me breathless and crazy-feeling -- remote from all human comfort myself. I would be grateful to hear from anyone who has experienced/ is experiencing a similar lack of compassion/anger at their AZ relative. It would be nice to feel that I am not alone in having such dark and tormenting feelings. **I added a title to your Thread so ppl know what it is about .you can change it to what you want if this is not it **.LYN Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 1/8/2008 11:42:27 AM (GMT-7)","Caregiving job must come from the heart. You will never understand them if you are doing this as an obligation or just a job. There are significant changges in the personality and behavior of Alzheimer's and if you don't understand them you will end up in frustrations and anger. It's not your fault nor your mother that this happened. Try to research and study about the disease and this might give you enlightenment to your problem. I'm sorry you feel that way to your mother. I undersand your feeling. It's not easy to accept that you are sick, it take times for the adjustment for both. Education about the disease will help to be understanding , compassionate and loving to your loved ones.


 I appreciate your responses. I am thinking about going to see a therapist about how angry I am feeling in hopes that I will be able to make peace with my mother before she passes on. It would be nice to be making memories with her even now instead of barely holding it together.


 Dear Horse, Try this website and look for postings by Johanna from California. She has been through this and has come out the other side. You will, too. www.alz.org Mary


 Thanks Mary for that link I do hope Horse will go to it and find some peace inside........ Luvs LYN


 Horse I am so sorry that First you do feel so Angry and Frustrated with your Mom It sounds like you are very Bitter as well for having to put your life on hold to help take care of her and for all the past and mistakes made Can you take some downtime find an agency that will come in for a few days and look after her while you go and get some rest and think real hard on why you are holding all these things against her still ..why you are not able to work thru them and try to get past them I do not know all of your history and I do not judge you at all I feel sorry that this is the way it will end f there is no understanding what is going on indside you that will NOT allow for compassion and caring ...... My mom never had my life handed to me on a silver platter and we had bad things in our past as well BUT I would give anything IF she was still here with me and not gone and I know that the toll it takes on Caregivers is a hard one you have to WANT to be the caregiver Being forced into that situation will not help you or your mom at all ........NEVER I really am saddened that you will not make memories with her and forgive but thats not my decision that is YOURS and yours alone YOU really sound like you need a break my friend a time alone for you to think revise or review and FIND some good times ( I am sure there had to be some) I am going to bring some older threads back up and also suggesst that you might talk to your doc about the feelings you have Find the support there is out there to come in and HELP you out and let you have some time away that may help abit you are feeling strangled right now and thats not how this should end IMHO Please let me know how you are doing Remember too please this is NOT her fault nor is it yours I am here LYN

Another question - how do you get them to take their meds???,"Last summer I found out that gma wasn't taking her fiber or vitamin pills. Granted these aren't life or death meds but she has to take fiber for different reasons (diverticulosis and iron supplement consumption - which can lead to constipation). I give her pills in the morning in a small medicine cup which she takes them after she eats, but she pockets her fiber pills and vitamin and throws them away in her trash in her room (I sometimes don't catch her doing it because she waits until I'm out of the room). I found her pills again in her trash can and asked her why she wasn't taking her pills and she replied, Oh I didn't know those were in there! She has told me once before that she doesn't like the fiber pills so we tried other alternatives but she didn't like them either so she said she would give the pills another shot. The last time she stopped taking her fiber pills, I had to take her to ER due to a blockage in her intestine. At least she is taking her other important pills such as the iron and blood pressure med. I do try to make sure she eats fiberous things thru out the day but she needs that extra fiber to help her along if you know what I mean. Any suggestions?","Thanks Lyn :) I actually thought about putting small doses of Fibersure in her morning coffee. But boy do I feel sneaky for doing that! lol I guess I can try huh?


 Ohhhh I like the cookie idea Rosie! Gma definately has a weakness for cookies :) As for the water, I'm always pushing her to drink more water anyway because she has a nephrostomy tube in her right kidney and a stent in her left. She is supposed to drink a lot of water because of that and she has a tendancy of not drinking much. Thank you! :)


 HI there RED... What I had to do wth MOm was crush them and put them ( half at a time ) in her small glass of juice ...... Once she got to bad for that I uesd a large needless syringe and sucked them up thru that and put into her Mouth ,,.lol...nope she didnt like that at all Towards the end when she had pablum thru a large hole in a baby bottle I would mix in there....... You can also crush and mix in some different mashed up foods as long as she wont taste them ( halving again works or did for me YOU can try lil ways to see if thy work hope some of these help NOT trying to scare you but i once had a patient thru homecare that had to have tube put in het tummy to get feces out all I could smell was feces on her breath I tried to disimpact her but that did not work....... With dad I have no problems yet but I know I will so I am working on things to get thru that I will keep you posted the fibrous foods are a great way to go about it but like you said she does and will ned more imhoYou can get the needless syringes ( big ones) at pharmacy Also see if doc has a good idea it never hurts to ask ya know Let me know how you make out ...... Mom had Divi too ....... Take care you .......Luvs LYN.


 Hi Sherry, Wonder if she would chew children's vitamins??? It sounds like she doesn't want to swallow the big ones. You can put fiber in cookie dough too. LOL, she could eat a homemade oatmeal cookie that has AllBran in them!! LOL. Also, make sure she drinks lots of water. The fiber can backfire, if they don't get enough hydration as it absorbs a lot of moisture. Lynn had some great suggestions. My dad was crafty about hiding pills too. We would find them here and there . . . *sigh* . . . we all get an A+ for effort!! Blessings!


 WE do what we have to do thats for sure.AH they do know we love them and thats what COUNTS..GREAT IDEA Rosie about the cookies too ......and definitely about the plenty of water..... Keep me posted Sherry... Luvs Lyn"
Hashimoto's Encephalopathy,"Hi everyone. I'm sorry to bust in on the Alzheimers message board, but I don't see any other boards that this fits into. Does anyone out there have any first hand knowledge of ""Hashimoto's Encephalopathy""? From what I read on the internet, it is believed that many people who have Hashimoto's Encephalopathy have actually been misdiagnosed with early onset Alzheimers. If this is true, I'm thinking that some of you might want to learn about H.E. If anyone does know first hand about this disease, I'd really love to hear from you. My husband has recently been diagnosed. We're told that there are very few confirmed cases of this in the U.S, and we'd really like to get as much information as we can. Thanks for any help that you can give!","Hey Lynn . . . sorry you are still having so much trouble in that area. ARGH! Like you need the additional stress. Prayers, hugs and Blessings to you dear sis!! Hello Goldie!! Welcome to the forum. I do know a member who has HE. She visits the Lupus forum. Her member name is Emmi and she has several overlap diseases including HE. I believe this disease is auto-immune . . .meaning that the body attacks itself (like it attacks disease). So is Lupus, so you might make a post on the lupus forum much like the one you've made here and Emmi might see it. If I see your post, I'll bump it up if its falls too far down the list of topics until Emmi gets a chance to respond to you. She is a real sweetie and I'm sure she'd be happy to share info. Blessings!


 Sheryl I am glad Rosie was able to he;lp you out You will find she is great in support and has alot of Knowledge in the many faces of Alzheimers Let us know how you make out I will be checking into some things for you tomorrow God Bless LYN *** Thanks my sweet sis..........NO i did nbot need these at this time BUT I will get thru it ....I have basically conquered the Wolves at the door for now at least My dad was and has been very aggitated thru all this I ty to tell them he is NOT STUPID at all he has a DD ...They do not get that at all ..PITY You take care and be well ..Keeping you in my heart thoughts and Prayers sis God Bless LYN

 Glad to see you Goldilocks .......... Hoping you and Emmi do catch up ........ LYN


 Hi again...I have heard a few things about this and I am sorry I have been AWOL for a couple of days BUT I do promise to look into this for you within the next couple of days I have been having family issues with my siblings over my dad so again I will get to this asap be well and I look forward to getting to know you and about your hubby as well God Bless LYN


 Thanks, Rosie! I appreciate your help. I'm also trying to get the word out to people who have been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's that H.E. is believed to be frequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's. Most people (including doctors) have never even heard of H.E., so someone with a diagnosis of early Alzheimer's would never even know to ask about H.E. Sheryl


 Sheryl . . . Yes, it is a little known disease . . . I hope you and Emmi get a chance to chat. Lyn . . . ARGH!!!! ""The Wolves"" LOL good one!! I can always picture your posts . . . I see the ""wolves at the door"" and you protecting your dad!! LOL what a scene . . . as if it wasn't hard enough w/o having to deal with ignorance. Sorry sis . . . enjoy your little break from them. Give dad a big hug from Rosie!!! Blessings!


 Hi Goldilocks, I'm emmie. I hang out on the lupus forum. I also have a diagnosis of HE. I'd be glad to help you out with questions about it. I'm pretty sure my email is in my profile. It would probably be better if we ""talked"" there. Just so you know, before I was properly diagnosed, I had diagnosed myself with early onset Alzheimers. Hope to hear from you, emmie


 Thanks Emmi. Are you the same Emmi that's on the HELPS website? Sheryl (goldilocks)"
quick question to anyone,"MY father-in-law has Alzheimers, My husband come home last night and said that there is suppose to be a new drug that they are useing in Sweden he thinks. anyway they inject the med into the back of there necks it is suppose to be giving 100% cure for some patience and for some that are worse like 80%.

 I appologies for not being on for a VERY long time. I was extremely busy with my studies and working very hard at work trying to earn money for a car. Now on my 3rd quarter in college I feel as though I have grown up and matured a lot more. However the holidays rolled around and I had probably the worst Christmas I ever experienced in my life. First off my grandparents were no longer with us. It was odd not having them around anymore and not being able to shop for them. I remember I would always buy my grandfather a John Deer hat and he would immediatly place it upon his head and smile. Always bought my grandma satin PJs and she always wore them to bed. My birthday was in late September (the 23d) and it was odd. I waited and waited and waited for my birthday card to arrive from them. Every year they would mail me out a really cute and sweet birthday card along with a check. I didn't care about the check, I just wanted the card from them tellimg me how much they loved and missed me. Receiving that card would of told me that everything I went through in 2007 was a nightmare. A long, hard nightmare. But the card never arrived. To this day I still wait for it. For Christmas the only thing I wanted was to have them back. I wanted to hear their voices. I wanted to receive their hugs and kisses. I needed them. I miss the way pappy would make my sandwitches. I miss taking long walks through the field and down by the creek with him talking about all kinds of things. I miss watching the price is right every time I spent the night or went over for lunch. I miss watching him watch wrestling, how he would really get into it and act as if he was fighting alongside the wrestlers. I miss mimi's famous spagetti sauce. I miss sitting at the kitchen table talking with her as she permed her hair. I miss picking her up form work with pappy. I miss the smell of their clothes that reminded me of every memory I have of them. As life continues to go I feel as though I'm forgetting them more and more. I don't want to ever forget them. I can't! However as much as it hurt me last year to go through what I did, if I had to go through it all again to earn the amazing friendship I gained with my cousin Tara, I would. the bond between us is unbreakable. Together we survived 2007 and together will will survive everything life has to throw at us. She is my cousin, my best friend, my sister. She is literally my other half. As the holidays came and passed the the begining of 2008 arrived, I believe I am more at peace with 2007 and have begun to realize more that they wont return to this life but I will reunite with them once I have lived my life and leave this place. Enough about my life, what have you all been up to? What have I missed? Lynn how are you and your father doing?


 Thanks Lynn, You are the best. Really you are. You and the rest of the squad here have help me through a lot the past year and I can't thank you all enough for it. I love you all from the bottom of my heart! I can't recall if I've talked to them. I know i made an attempt at it but found it uncomfortable. however I do write a lot and I feel as if Im talking to them through my writting. I feel like they know when im having a bad day at work or something because for example i was about to lose patience on one of my managers at work (I do NOT enjoy working with him. he's got a stick up his butt that needs to be removed.) anyway and im on the verge of saying something when ""You're Beautiful"" by James Blunt comes on. That song was on both my grandparents' CDs at the funeral home. it was like they were telling me ""its not worth it. Just be patient."" so I get signs here and there. I view them as signs instead of coinsitences. Well I must be off. I have to clock back into work in 20 minutes and don't want to be late for that. God Bless Nikky


 Please share it. I would love to read it. I meant every word of it Lynn. I really did.


 *tears* I loved it Lynn. I really Love it! It's so sweet and sad at the same time. Great job honey.


 As long as it helps you with closure and ease the pain go for it. I'm glad it helps you. How is your dad doing? How are you doing?


 An emergency cat scan!?!?? oh no! whys that? What have they found? Plz let me know if anything happens. May God be with you in your time of need sweetie!


 awwww. Im sorry to hear that. Wait what does cancer do when its brain cancer?


 wow! thats a lot of people. the smell of cancer? it has a scent? !!!!O_O!!!!


 awwwww. im sry sweetie. I never knew you could actually smell it... unless you mean ""i can feel it in my bones"" kind of smell


 I hope your siblings do show up. Sorry to hear it's cancer and anerism. I hope its not painful for him. Good luck sweetie and god bless.


 You let me know how everything goes hun. My thoguht and prays are with you and your family.


 on a possitive note i survived my first year without my grandpa. It was a yer ago on sunday.


 Not a problem Lynn, Once he's gone he won't be in anymore pain and he wont be suffering and he'll be back wth your mom. and they'll both be looing down on you and smile and they are sooooooooooooo proud of you sweetie. And Im sure you father thanks you SOOOOOOO much for taking care of him this whole time. Once he's gone you take care of yourself you hear?! (you said you had something i just cant remember off the top of my hed what it was) be strong and keep on going. No matter how hard life gets the sun will always rise the next day. Everyday is a chapter. The chapter starts the moment you wake up and finishes when you go to sleep. God Bless hun. Love you! Nikky"

This is a hard but rewarding thing to do I really believe........IF you can do it Educate yourselves please and your children so it is being understood more.......IT needs to be WE are losing the very woman and men that fought for our countries to this horrrid disease of the mind and affecting the body as well in most cases....... Our Seniors are the souls of our existence in my opinion and they are going into this DD at an alarming rate.........Food for thought All Alzheimers Society's would appreciate anything even the smallest gesture or volunteering .......","That is what they are saying now Navy and I am positive thats exactly what it is ..

New here.,"Hello Everyone, My spouse has AD, we are in what I believe is Stage 5-6. DH was pretty steady for about a year stage 4-5. He was on Namenda only, twice daily for a year, then a few months back his doc added Aricept. All was good for 2-3 months as DH was seemingly more alert and engaged in his surroundings. Then boom, couple months ago he began to really change. Mood swings, way more forgetful. Recently even hallucinating. His regular doc has now decided to send us to Neurology. Meanwhile, no med changes except for the addition of B=12 injections once a month. We have seen a great decline in his MMSE. DH is in early 70's. I believe we can trace changes going back to his mid 60's, but not diagnosed until late 60's as he is/was a master at covering up. Glad to become a member, and looking forward to sharing with you all. Post Edited (In The Shadow) : 9/20/2007 1:26:39 AM (GMT-6)","HI hun Have been wondering how you are doing and how your DH is doing as well Post when you can .........you have us in your corner........

EMPATHY................APATHY..............Huge Difference!!!!!!!!!,"We,who have AD haev Apathy,we don't want to do anything,period!There are meds.for this,as it shows depression.I'm on Remeron,still could care less about doing much.","I was,at one time.I do my helping over the internet,but I'm up front & to the point about things.Don't have time nor care about doing ""oh,baby I feel so sorry""type things.I can say them,I just don't feel it.Yes,AD has done a number on me,can't help it. I have no interest in cleaning house,doing dishes,laundry,stuff like that. Alot of what I loved to do is gone.........


 Right now my main thing is getting Larry to & from therapy,& eating lunch out.lol.We'll be going 3 times a week for the next month.I can still do anything I want,I just son't want to.Make sense?


 AR..wondered where you had got to .I thought I had scared you off lol............No one is at fault but me over the chat times I said at the beginning I was only human so I learn thru trial and error right lol.How are you doing and how is your dad ?Been thinking about you.Yes crohns does do a lot to your body and with the pyoderma it just adds to it.My one finger is so bad right now looks as though its ready to come off.The pain is unbearable at times but hey i will get thru it .You let me know about your availability for chat and Peter has put me in the right direction for the calendar so i will yak to SL and go from there ok ........Take care and GOD BLESS


 Ar am still on IV antibiotics but they dont seem to be doing the trick this time ..am in severe pain always i kinda think i would rather have no finger than one like this .........my daughter is just terrified as she doesnt see me get this bad usually..........Having hard time with mom as no one else looks after her and I cant just leave her on her own all the time ...cait and hubby trying to help out as much as possible.Thanks for your concern ..............take care of yourself and May God Bless


 AR....my siblings thoughts are to put her in a home thats all no talking it over just that one sided idea......they do not remember that she brought them into this world loved them .supported their every decision in life(good or bad) and still tries to be MOM..........I am not that way and never could be ......I have talked with HOwie over moving into their big house and having her f/t to give dad a break....both Cait and Howie are great with her and I know that Dad is getting tired and scared.Just recently found out that when she was at the docs(i didnt go for once) that he rx her ativan and I know now why she was flipping out and acting very strange....took the pills and info to the doc and told him NEVER to give her meds without my consent /knowledge as she has reactions to a lot of them.I am listed as her legal guardian and the doc was made quite aware of this so I am sure it will not happen again................................On a lighter note am glad you and your Dad are doing and spending so much quality time together it is very important for him as well as you .....I think about you always and have you and your family in my prayers...........God Bless and Keep You Healthy


 AR......I honestly dont know what to tell you about the whispering ,my mom does it with cait and I ..........its like its supposed to be our lil secret thing that we are doing .....i dont know but I do know it makes for a great time with her.Maybe she thinks she is getting one over on dad LOL.My siblings are nothing like yours hun ,they live right here in town and dont bother with her or my dad.My hubby will shoot dad 40.00 to go to the casino and then cait and I spend the day doing as much as Mom feels up to ,sometimes I just watch her sleep peacefully.Siblings need to understand that we are not there for what we can gain when she goes but for what we are gaining while she is still here to show us things and she is still able to teach us a few things as well.They are losing out and for that I feel bad but I wont push them to love their mom........that comes naturally........Take Care ....GOD BLESS


 Dad did his disapperaing act at Market on me thought it was a hoot Wind me up and watch me go lol Hoping all are well Lyn


 I know that feeling lol Dad doesnt always whisper and he has not lost his sarcasm at at times .......Yes I do laugh alot and not at him as you know but with him it is rewarding but sometimes it is hard Yes my Pyoderma is directly related to crohns ..........It has gotten alot better I do have to watch stress and trauma to body or I break out Thanks for your support and care Take care and always be well Luvs Lyn

 EMPATHY......Makes for a very FULL heart and beautiful heart Happy Easter all ...... Blessings


 MY sister needs to find out what the difference is between the two nono EMPATHY she has NONE APATHY she has plenty yeah There is a big difference and I wish she knew the difference Just my opinion


 EMPATHY ......The ability to put yourself in the other persons shoes,the willingness to try and understand just what they go thru on a day to day basis.an honest attempt at giving that person your support and love and understanding...............APATHY.........Not being willing to put yourself in anyones shoes other than your own:caring only about one person YOU.Not truly understanding what we are telling you about how we feel but ""saying "" that you do ..............................I was at the mercy of this type of person(nurse) this wknd and it sure made me see the light and also see what our world has come too especailly in the health care field.As he was asking me questions.......he wasnt waiting for my answer before asking another/asked me how long I had this ""boo boo""......first off the so called boo boo is crater like and basically eating my finger away,but ok its a boo boo.I would never have treated a patient as I was treated by this so called professional.Obviously he missed the class of Empathy 101 while at school.As for the peeps in the waiting room I got some looks and side steps(want to yell at the top of voice its not contagious:but let them sweat)..... LOL ........My family all say they understand how I feel and yet they dont have a Clue........They keep piling more on my plate and adding to the stress,which in turn makes the crohns worse as we all know and the PG as well.They dont get it at all that the ones who ultimately pay for me being down is Cait and Howie (self).They dont have to live with me and see what I go thru.I find my HW Family does care and they DO have EMPATHY......and for all of you I am so very thankful that I have you all.I keep you in my heart and in my prayers as I am able to EMPATHIZE with you totally and honestly.Take Care And God BLess........Lyn


 SL............You are on this board showing that you care for people...........you were in the nursing field for all those years, over 30 right so you may be apathetic now because of this AD:But at one time you must have been emphathetic to be the type of caring nurse you were.You still have some of those caring qualities as even with the AD you are looking after Larry.I hope you have a good night and are better rested than you were the other day....as you had said you were overtired and didnt know when to rest..thats my biggest problem as well................I am truly sorry about the chat mixup and I take full responsibility..............I hope we can set it up for Monday at 6pm if you are interested.i am posting this at 5:30 where I am so we can figure the time diff if there is one...........Take Care and God Bless you and Larry


 .....SnowyLynne............I am truly sorry that this AD has taken so much from you.May God Bless and Keep You Safe


 Hello Lyn and Snowy . . . Lyn: How did things work out with your soar ? If you went to the ER it must have been pretty bad. I didn't realize that Crohns caused such problems. I guess I should learn more about that, as Crohns is becoming more common. Let us know how things are. Snowy: You do have your hands full!! The Jigsaw Puzzles are still Dad's favorite. He really likes to spread that glue on there and then when they dry we hang them on the wall. He has a real art gallary going. But he loves to show his finished puzzles to all who come to visit. Lyn: Sorry, I have had computer problems and was at Dad's today (Mondays). . . I'm sorry I didn't even see the post about chat time until now. Lyn . . . you must be Eastern time because the time you typed in your message and the time of the post matched for me and I am Eastern time. If Snowy is in Texas . . . that might be Central time . . . but I have a hard time making a commitment for chat. I am home all day and when hubby gets home in the evening, I like to care for his needs. I am often on the computer around 8 or 9 or 10 in the eves. . . but 6:00 I am preparing or serving dinner. Don't plan around me. I will catch you when I can. Blessings!


 Lyn, How do you you treat that finger? What did they do for you at ER? ((((((Lyn))))))))) My computer is on the fritz so I use hubby's when I can. Thanks for asking. Dad has developed a real closeness to me. He goes to my picture and asks mom why I am not there. When I arrive, he hugs me and says ""I thought you were never coming back"" :sad: I went 3x last week but he doesn't remember. So I just get over there when I can enjoy him in our puzzle making. Blessings!


 Oh Lyn, You are having a time of it!!! I am sure that your flare is made worse and longer by your exhausting schedule with all that you are doing. Would you husband consider getting on the phone with your sibblings to schedule some help at your mom's. Even if they could help with things that are not her personal care . . . like house cleaning, laundry, bringing in some meals and grocery shopping, maintenance on the home etc. You won't be any good to her in the hospital. No need to answer this post . . . just a thought. You and your family are in my prayers. Blessings!


 Sorry your siblings have closed a very special door. Hmmmmm, I guess we all have to make our own decisions. I have 8 brothers and sisters. One sister and I make sure we are there at least once a week. The others are either very busy or don't realize how much mom would appreciate a break or a visit. I have talked to them . . .but they probably think they have many tomorrows left. You are a GREAT daughter. . . and your hubby and daughter are to be commended for their compassion for your and your mom. Dad and I tried an ""activity pad"". The ones that have follow the dots and color by number, etc. He really enjoyed it and wouldn't skip a page. He colors VERY carefully and very thouroghyly. He even redid some of my work. He whispers when we are puzzling or coloring. Very sweet. I'm not sure why, but it is special. Thanks for the prayers !!! I will pray for you and your family as well!! Blessings!


 Now it is put dad in a home lol They cannot get that out of their head put them in homes no worries Not in my time Lyn


 Hi Lyn. So sorry that you are having such a rough time. I see this thread was started a while ago. Did your finger heal ok in the end?And was it due to your Crohns? My Sister doesnt whisper. In fact she has a habit of saying some things out loud,especialy when we are around other people. She was in the fish and chip shop with her husband the other day. Now,my Sister has developed a habit(not her fault obviously,its due to her illness)she constantly refers to ""cats"" everything she sees is either ""a cat"" or ""a cat one"" Anyway, while in the chip shop she pointed to some sausages and said rather loudly ""Cat one,look cat ones!"" The guy behind the counter couldnt help but laugh. My sisters Husband said somthing like ""oh its ok take no notice she isnt well"" and the guy behind the counter replied, ""Oh I see,but it was funny though"" He said it in a kindly way,he wasnt making fun. You have to laugh about things sometimes dont you? otherwise we all know what the other option is:-(


 So great to see our sweet Rosie here Definitely a lady with Empathy Lyn [img]/community/emoticons/yeah.gif[/img]


 I have had a real eye opener on this with my dad in hospital and seeing other older folk with AD having NO visitors nor company at all ......Nurse Just dont find the time nor have they got enough here at the Critical Care Unit IMO...... I talk to all the ones I can it is sad n heartwrenching but I feel I need and want to Pay It Forward....... God Bless All LYN

Gallbladder surgery,"Hi, My Daddy has alzheimer's disease. He just had his gallbladder removed. He doesn't really have much of an appetite. He used to love Ensure, but now it gives him diarreah(sorry- misspelled). What else can we try? Thanks, Dorsey's daughter","Thank you June 17


 Hi there Both are rigth about the input they gave you I am hoping you will continue to post and let us know how your Dad is doing Pleanty of support and caring on this site Check out Resources and back pages or threads ..... Again glad you had the input I was out sick ..........LYN Thanks sis and June


 Thanks Alice for posting this input Always great to hear from ppl that have had experience whether good or bad Be well my friend........LYN


 9ball After several years of chronic diarrea following gallbladder surgery. My brother had his removed and had the same problem . His doctor recommended Questran, which is a chlosteral medication. So I asked my Dr. for a prescript ion, he said no problem try it it's harmless. Maybe your dad can take it. Gotta tell you it is a powder and tastes really bad.


 Hi 9ball, Sorry your dad is having problems. Make sure to let his doc know about this. Oddly . . .adding fiber can help diarrhea or constipation. By bulking up the stool (absorbing water) it will help the D. I hope this helps. Blessings!


 Hi 9Ball, I don't know what other conditions your father may have, but a dr. may not prescribe Questran for him if he has some conditions or certain other meds. My mother and I both had our GB out 15 yrs. ago. We both had a terrible time with the big D, my dr gave me Questran, what a difference. I told my mother and her dr. gave it to her, it didn't work. She also continued to eat junk, and paid for it. The past yr her D has gotten even worse, her Cardio dr. said he DID NOT want her on Questran it could cause her big time problems. Not long ago she was also dx w/ AD. She still has the prob w/ D on occassions. But she has so many health issues and meds they all seem to work against her stomach sometimes. I originally used Questran, but for a long time I've used Questran Light. If you do get it for your father, you can mix the powder w/ water or OJ, BUT you must have a least another full glass of water after it. It does work for most ppl. Hope it can work for your father. Have a good day. God bless. Alice."
Incontinence,"Hi guys! I need help! I'm a non-medical caregiver for someone who has alzeimers and is also incontinent. I sleep in a separate room overnight. When she wakes up a monitor turns on and I can see what she is doing... so that if she gets up it means she is wet. Her alzeimers has progressed. She is no longer getting up when she is wet so the monitor isn't turning on- but she will still get wet throughout the night. Is there a system that we could set up where it would notify me whether the bed is wet or not. I know that there are systems that alarms go off for children when they wet the bed... but I don't know if that's the route to go considering that's a device that was developed in order to teach the person not to wet the bed- which doesn't relate to her in any way. Maybe a light goes on for me if it's wet?? Is there anything that anyone has heard about that might be helpful? Also, the briefs that she is are really irritating her skin... are there any alternatives for more comfortable briefs that she could be wearing, because she is constantly trying to take them off.","Hi Pat . . . I Googled ""Wet diaper alarm"" and there seems to be LOTS of choices out there. Blessings!


 HI there Great question and I see you got the best answers already ....... Try that site Rosie mentioned .......... Stay with us and get the help and support you need LYN


 THANKS for your input MM


 Its great that you can get the briefs on her. Would she wear the Poise pads that go in underwear??? What if you put underwear on first and then the briefs. Thinking out loud here. Would be difficult to get wet panties off though. We could never get any type of protection on dad. We just had to clean up wherever he peed, but he would often pee in a waste can so that was actually helpful. If she is sleeping, I'm not sure I would wake her. When you change her, is there any chance of getting some medicated talk on her skin. That might be more tolerated than, say, diaper rash ointment. There are also liners sold for baby diapers intended for catching poop. I wonder if that would be softer on her skin . . . even a light weight soft fabric cut in the shape of the brief. It would need to be laundered, but might be less uncomfortable. Also, different brands are tolerated by different people. Notice if certain food or beverages make the rash worse . . . when my kids were babies, one of them could not tolerate chocolate milk or orange juice as it made a really bad diaper rash . . . Hopefully someone else will have some ideas. Keep us posted as to what works and what doesn't . . . it will help other people here as well. Welcome to the forum Pat!!! Blessings!


 Get her some depends or asuurance pull ups & put them on her at nite,or daytime if need be..............


 Incontinence in bowel and urine is a part of AD. Yes, there s an adult premium diaper which keeps them dry even if they pee for several times. The urine is transform into a gel and keep the skin dry. One more thing yo can do is give her less water at night so she will pee less. And if she/he pee a lot,let her doctor know and she can be prescribed Flomax that will help her control her urination."

surgery and hospital stay and  alzheimers,"Hello all, My father has suffered with alzheimers for several year now. He is deffenetly in the final phase of the moderate stage. He can not dress himself, communicate very well, gets very angry at times and is easily confused. To make matters worse he also has bladder cancer that has been unstopable with two rounds of Chemo. The doctors are all recomending removal of the bladder. The sugery is Major sugery wich will require a 10 day dopistal stay and leave my dad with a bag. I am very worried about the hospital stay itself. He can not be left at home, my mother is with him. But how can he be in a hospital room my himself. I have read that being in a hospital with alzheimers can be very devestating. I am concerend that his alzheimers will progress even quicker after is surgery. What questions should be ask the doctors about his stay in the hospital. He is being treated at the VA (WOnderful people) for his Alzheimers. Can they help in any way. THe surgery is being done at another hospital. I am afraid that he will try to leave and become very angy. We do nor want him restrained in any way, and have heard that sedatives should not be used on Ad patients. Any advise would be very helpful Hyrangea","My grandmother has been in and out of the hospital for infections in her kidneys and bladder AFTER her bout of bladder cancer. But unlike your father, she responded very well to chemo and radiation. At the time of her hospitalization for urosepsis, we didn't know about her AZ. She had surgery to insert kidney stents in which they gave her anesthesia. She responded VERY badly to the anesthesia and became highly confused, beligerent and emotional. There were times too that she would find a tube connected to her that she didn't know what it was - well the nurses then told me that she was trying to rip out her catheter! I don't think they ever restrained her but they did put a bed alarm on. Now gma still has a kidney stent but she also has a nephrostomy tube in which she has to go in every 3 months to have them exchanged. I insist they use only a spinal block and she does wonderfully. I don't know if that would be an option for your father or not since they have to remove his bladder but you can ask. As for him being in the hospital, I know the nurses here are trained to deal with AZ patients as long as they know that is what they are dealing with.


 I personally have to applaud the decision not to do surgury IF he is this far gone it had to have been a heart pain filled decision .......let him and your GM have their love story ending Beautiful and together... Thanks for posting and keep us posted plz


 THERE are some very safe sedatives for AD ppl to take so first I would ask what the surgury entails what sedatives ( no ativan IMHO) .how long before he is going to start a physio TX plan and he will need one with the bag ........( at least in Canadian Hospitals they do ) Find all you can out abot the hospital e will be in and what nurses are responsible for him MAKE sure you put no restraints in writing although sometimes they are needed with certain ppl BUT I understand what you are saying One of you I am sure can stay with him at hospital take turns if there are more than a couple of siblings and I am sure ALL will work out for the best I am sure others will post as well and give input Hope i helped out in some small way God Bless Will keep him and you,your family in my prayers LYNr


 Thank you both for your post. We talked to my fathers surgeon as well as his neurologist, and together (My mothers ultamite decision) we have decided not to do surgery. His AD is progressing very quickley and his response to surgery in all probability would not be good. My mother has decided to keep his quality of life as good as she can right now. The docotrs do not know how quickly to cancer will spread, or how quickly his Ad will progress. I guess you can say its a 50/50 chance of his caner spreading or his Ad progressing.It was a very hard decision for my mother. They truly have a great love story. She has decided to take him to is favorite spot in the country and enjoy the time that they have left together. This is truly a disease that robs you of your loved ones. I really know the reason behind the saying ""The Long goodbye"". God bless, Hydrangea"
need medicine to help sleep,"Hi, I posted a few days ago about my Daddy having diarerrah(sorry mispelled)We are having a terrible time trying to get him to sleep at night. While he was in the hospital with complications from gallbladder surgery they tried haldol, demoral, ambien, benedryl, ativan and temazepam. None of these worked. They made him very restless and kind of out of it. No sleep. Is there anything else that we can try? We are fixing to have to put him in a nursing home because for some reason he can't pee and they had to put a cathater in him at the hospital and when he got home, he pulled it out. The home health nurse told us that he would be better off in a nursing home because he might bleed to death if he pulled it out one too many times. He didn't even know that he pulled it out. We have to watch him like a hawk. But I really would like for him to be sleeping at night before he goes to the nursing home because I don't want them to drug him up. That would make matters worse. If anybody has any ideas I would really appreciate it. Dorseys daughter","Thanks for your reply, we had to put Daddy in the nursing home today. Dorsey's daughter


 THanks Snowy Sorry about having to put your Dad in a home LYN


 Lyn, He is doing fairly well. They took his cathater out but he wasn't able to pee on his own so they had to put it back in. The next step is to see why he can't go on his own. But he doesn't want to be there. I think that he thinks that we don't want to fool with him is the reason that we put him there. If he hadn't pulled his cathater out, he would still be at home. But we were afraid that he would pull it out again and bleed to death. The situation is hell on us kids. Thanks for asking. Dorseys daughter


 Hi there First Ativan in AD ppl to me in my opinion is not a good drug at all Nor is haldol Temeazepam hadsa to be taken right prior to almost falling asleep or it MAY have tyhe oppisite efect I would suggesst a benzo like diazappam but a small dosge like 1 to 5 mgss 'I know this helped my mom and also my dad BUT DO talk to the doc first plz as I am not a profeesional Just trying to help out Keep us posted plz Stay with us LYN

Turmeric and alzheimers... any hope?,"I've been reading about the possiblility that turmeric can help slow the formation of 'brain plaque' seen in alzheimers patients, and also may be useful in dissolving existing plaques. Are there any scientific studies that show this to be possible? With alz in my family history, I want to do everything possible to keep it from happening to me. Should I be taking turmeric? thanks! Post Edited (rrr1) : 4/15/2008 9:35:02 AM (GMT-6)","thanks for the reply. I will certainly talk with my dr about this... but do you have any info about how some folks respond to turmeric, while others do not? Where have you read this?

 Hi, I am new to the alzhiemers site, but I saw your post about turmeric/curcumin, and it rang a bell with the treatment I am taking for my ulcerative colitis and Gerd. It is an organic drink called Haldi, which contains an activated form of curcumin, along with some kind of proprietary formulation, and the only reason I knew about its benefits in alzhiemers was from the literature research I did when I started drinking Haldi for my colitis. It seems it is as beneficial for alzhiemers as it is for colitis and Gerd. I personally believe it is more of a prevention than a cure, but I found them at whole foods markets, and at their website which has a nice research page at Haldi4health.com. In this formulation, it seems you get better activity and absorption of the curcumin(they also taste good as well). I hope this helps. ------------------------------------------ yuckygut diagnosed 1998 drink 1 Haldi daily


 howlyncat, I wanted to say that I work with many alzheimers patients at the hospital, and your site is very imformative and helpful. It seems to me that the Haldi drinks work with inflammation, that is why I believe I have had so much success with it. I had tried curcumin pills in the past without success, but for whatever reason, this drink has done wonders for my disease process, and I believe it is helpful in all types of GI disorders. Anyway, I will keep reading your threads, keep up the good work. ---------------------------------------------- yuckygut diagnosed 1998 drink 1 Haldi daily


 Howlyncat, I am so sorry for the recent loss of your father, I wish you well. And I congratulate you on being an RN, as it is a great profession. I looked at the bottles of Haldi that I have, 1 is wild berry, and its ingredients are organic cherry juice, organic apple cider vinegar, purified water, organic raspberry, organic cane juice(sugar), vitamin c, citric acid, the curcumin amount not specified so I called the company,(since it is something I take daily) ,they said the curcumin is 200mg, and that they have a proprietary process that activates it so it actually is approx a gram. What was interesting to me with all that is the activated part of it, as opposed to the pills which are not water soluble and not used by the body. For my UC, it has been a blessing, as well as for my friend with fibromyalgia/IBS. The green tea is basically organic green tea, organic mint, organic lemon juice, water , curcumin, vit c , citric acid as well. I like the fact it is organic certified and tastes good. What is pyoderma gangrenosum? ------------------------------------------ yuckygut diagnosed 1998 drink 1 Haldi daily


 Few days’ back I’ve also posted here in a different thread ( https://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=8&m=1090589 ) after asking about Curcumin Extract, as my dearest cousin sister is still suffering with Alzheimer’s. Right now she is under medication. I asked doctor about Curcumin but he is not fully aware about this product’s effectiveness. I’ve found a site naturalplaza , where they’re talking on Curcumin. But still I’m not sure whether should I buy this for my sister or not.


 Jenny, just a quick comment on your post, I believe ingredients like curcumin, omega 3, etc, are more of a preventative with Alzheimers disease, and not necessarily curative like it can be with IBS, etc. Even the Haldi drinks which contain a more active form of curcumin, state prevention is best, or something like that. I think it is more of a personal choice, but as howlyncat said, be careful. ----------------------------- yuckygut diagnosed 1998 drink 1 Haldi daily


 Hi Jenny I also heard that curcumin is anti-amyloid and anti inflammatory in nature. These common anti-inflammatories have a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. So Researcher said that curcumin have enough potential for preventing Alzheimer's disease. I don’t know that your cousin is in preventative condition or not, if she is in preventative stage then you may try Curcumin Extract. Otherwise it's quite difficult to say that Curcumin would be helpful for her or not. So It's always better to consult with an expert.

Checking Out Those You Hire on as Caregivers!!!!!,"I just want to please implore all those that are perhaps needing people to look after their parent(s) or loved one to REALLY do a thorough and complete background check ....Criminal, Personal ,as well as past Emplyment history why they left how they looked after the ppl all these questions need and should be readily available upon your request not "" I can get it for you "" You are taking your most precious and leaving them with ppl to care due to whatever the circumstances are and instead of a NH you bring them into their home ( your home) YOU have every right to ask anything and get the answers ........ Just my opinion but I think it is worth mulling over and if anyone is worried about a police check then tell them ""dont let the door hit you on the way out"" Unless they can be upfront and honest it would be a no go Have a llist of their duties renumeration ect........ Your expectations on feeding grooming Moving them from bed to chair If bedridden ....moving to prevent decubti Pericare Footcare Out door or out activities Activities to keep them occupied and have brain cells made to work Just to mane a few I am sure Snowy Rosie and a few of others may have some input as well ** I am just thinking with more ppl keeping family members at home and hiring outside help it is necessary to find out ALL there is to know about ppl prior to any problems arising ** LYN....add if you have more please I would appreciate the input for sure","Do get those that live up to YOUR standards Not those that you have to live up to THEIRS This is your most priceless gifts in life parents grandparents ect Take the time and find the right one please LYN


 EVEN family members have been known to take full advantage of the situation weigh your options first and remember it is important LYN


 Actually for all looking into Caregivers for loved ones This is important


 HI hun I brought this up to the top for you so it might help you in finding someone to look after hubby TTT means to the top Luvs ya In my heart and prayers LYN


 THanks Minmark great input to go along with rest ........ You are wonderful Be well sweetie Luvs Lyn


 TTT


 If you have had to hire on a caregiver as of late Please feel free to add some info Snowy I know you have some to share Luvs to all how is Larry doing LYN


 **IF you have any odd feelings or hair stands up on neck whatever the bad feeling is IT is telling you FIND Someone else please


 This would also apply to full disclosure and reports of a NH you ar looking at for someone they have to give you answers You have the right to ask about Number of nurses per shift/resident Meals /dietary aide ect Cleaning If nurses have training in hoyer lifts and transfering special patient Decubti reports Doctor for the Hom Thats just a very basic list ask anything and everything IMO


 Lyn, I don't know what TTT (for Mary) means. Mary


 Can I add some criteria in hiring caregiivers : Check for their background, You can always ask for their fingerprint clearance from the FBI, To check if they have criminal rercords. Ask for their references wheree they work before to know how reliable and dependable they are. They must be First Aid or CPR Certified to handle emergencies. They must have TB test and make sure that they are healthy. If you got them from the agency, always ask for their file and interview them first beforre hiring. Prepare questionaires. See how they answer or react to your questions. A smart and experienced caregiver answers question directly and clearly. Try at least 3 home care agencies and evaluate the services they offer, the criteria and rates (charges) Be sure the agncy is insured and bonded.

 Hey Snowy . . . you are such a trooper!! How have you been doing lately? I hope your hubby is finished with rehab and doing better by now. Lyn . . . Wow you really did it! I was just imagining stepping on that cake and it felt real good to get out the anger . . . until you said that you fractured your foot (as I was dreaming of a softer cake). Not funny . . . oh man, I can't help it, I'm laughing!!! I am soooo sorry for all your problems. I know what you mean about your Mom being upset. A brother of mine tried (in the wrong way) to get Dad to stop driving. We had it under control . . . but he caused a real problem and now Dad thinks 'that bugger got my license taken away'. . . Oh sis . . . you didn't need a broken foot on top of all else. I am pausing after this post to pray for you. You have been blown by the storms of life right into God's arms . . . for that I am thankful . . . but sometimes we just wonder how much we can take. You are not alone sis!! Blessings!

 Oh Snowy so dang happy for you both Its about time things got going good for you both Will keep you in my thoughts and heart Be well and say congrats to Larry for me please


 Hello Lyn. I just saw this thread now. I cant believe how long it has been since I last posted on here. Ouch,sorry about your foot,is it much better now? My Sisters symptoms seem to be worse lately such as with eating and drinking. We have to help her with that quite a bit more than before. When she spends time with me I find that a drinking straw makes a huge difference to how much she will drink. Over all,giving her time and patience makes a big difference to how she copes with everything. I just wish her Husband didnt drink too much,then he would cope better and the knock on effect would be that my sister would cope better too. Its frustrating because Myself,my other sisters and my niece,work hard to help my sister feel secure and we do our best to make a calm situation,but my Brother in law seems to undo everything we have done with my sister within the space of a few hours. She ends up,stressed,soiling herself,and pacing up and down for hours on end. I hate the situation. The Doctors and my sisters nurse know about the situation but aparently there is nothing that they can do other than what is being done already. Sorry,I didnt mean to go on. Thats one reason why I dont post much because I get myself wound up over it all.


 HI Rona Glad to see ya posting Hope you have a great day.......... Got flowers from Cait for mothers day so that made me happy for sure...... Going fisahing my fav pastime ... Be well my friend ......"
Another huge decision and I don't know what to do,"Last Saturday Morning I received a phone call that I was dreading. Moms sister ( my aunt Betty) lost her battle with cancer and passed at 9 am that morning. I am now faced with do I tell Mom her sister has passed? I am almost afraid that if I do she will become so upset it may cause her already sick heart to give up completely. Mom has been living with Atrial Fibrillation for almost 14 months now along with her dementia. Aunt Betty was her last living family member other than her children.. (myself, my sister and my twin brothers) and many grandchildren most of which she does not remember now. She and Aunt Betty stopped talking on the phone regularly about 3 years ago when Aunt Betty was told she only had 6 weeks to live. Aunt Betty didn't want my Mom to know she was dying and was always afraid that if they talked on the phone Mom would sense something bad was wrong so, she quit calling her. Mom hasn't asked me about her in almost 6 months now. I wonder if maybe she has already begun to forget her too. Am I wrong to not tell her? I feel like I am between a rock and a hard place and nowhere to squeeze through. Have any of you faced this problem? Do I even have the right to NOT tell her? Life has become so difficult so quickly.","Lynn, from what I've read of your posts, your mother is living in the past now. So in a way, for her Aunt Betty will always be alive and young. I don't see any good to come from telling her. If she asks about her in the future, you can gently tell her then or you can say something like ""Gee, we haven't heard from her for quite a while, have we? Tell me again about you and her growing up."" A.D. is a terrible disease, but in looking for any hint of a silver lining, the only one I can find is that it does relieve our loved ones of having to face and deal with some of the painful realities of life. I don't think I'd take that from her.


 Good Monring Lynn, I am so sorry about the death of your Aunt. My husband's Grandmother had Alzheimer's Disease and did not know or remember her own daughter from day to day toward the end. That was my Mother-in-law, who went everyday and spent a lot of the day with her at the Nursing Home. When My husband's Aunt, Grandmother's other daughter came down with cancer and died the family decided not to tell Grandma as every day if she would ask about her daughter it would be like hearing it for the first time and she would grieve every time. Grandma asked for her husband everyday and telling her he was gone always upset her. In the end she did not know anyone which was sad but we all continued to visit her and just sit with her and talk to her. I remember going to visit her at Christmas time and my husband is her first born grandchild. It was sad to have her look at him and she would ask him, and just ""Who are You?"" He would tell her and she would just shake her head. She loved the Christmas present...............the wrapping paper and the bow, it kept her hands busy. She had know idea what the present was but the bright colors of the paper made her happy. Well that is how our family handled it but I know your family has to make the decision based on what you feel is best. I will pray for you and may your God bless you. Kitt


 I dont believe in out and out lying to ppl with AD BUT I do believe in going to their world so I would be doing something akin to what Judy has posted Kitt has some great input as well I am so sorry for your loss God BLess LYN"

Need some advice please????,"My Gma has been in the assisted living center now for about a month and a half. I knew that moving her to a different location would make her more confused then she already was. Well it seems she is getting worse. They are still waiting for authorization from her insurance company to start her on Namenda. She has a nephrostomy tube - this is a tube that goes directly into her kidney and has a bag attached to her leg, much like a catheter bag. 95% of her urine goes directly into this bag. Without the bag, her urine goes thru her bladder, which by now is about the size of a walnut and she has no control over her bladder. Urine just pours out of her bladder which is why she has a nephrostomy bag - well that and her kidneys were shutting down. So here comes why I need some advice. She seems to keep forgetting why she has this bag attached to her leg. She has already twisted the bag so much by tying in up and whatnot that it keeps getting leaks and I've had to replace the bag twice already - these bags are not easy to get btw. I even got a phone call from the center that one time she took the bag off (it unscrews from the tube) and refused to put it back on. So of course I had to talk her into putting it back on. Well this morning I got a call again but this time she cut the tube! So now she has no way of connecting the bag because there is no way to screw the bag back on. Does anyone have any insight as to how I can get her to leave her bag alone?? Her tube can get capped off so she doesn't have a bag, but then all her urine goes thru her bladder and she will go thru about 6 adult diapers in an hour.","I am so sorry that she is going thru this as are you I agree with snowy that maybe its best to double or triple her depends I am hoping you get this straightened out asap........... Take care Lyn


 YOU are doing a wonderful job with her and I am so glad you are on top of everything I know it can be hard at times I know all too well .......... I am glad the damage did not cause reason for surgery and I DO hope they will check on her as you requested Good idea about taking out scissors and anything she can cut it with Luvs LYN


 She has to have the nephrostomy tube and bag because her kidneys were shutting down. She also has a stent. Before she had these surgically inserted, she did have a catheter bag but she was getting uerospepsis and would end up in the hospital with massive infections. So far, since she has had the nephrostomy bag and tube inserted, she has managed to stay out of the hospital. And unfortunately, gma doesn't have the choice of limiting her fluid intake. Her kidneys need it unfortunately. Thanks for the ideas though. Btw, I got a call a couple days ago that they had to take her Depends away (of course they bring 1-2 every hour to her) because she was tearing the stuffing out of them as well as throwing away unused ones. But I got the new bags for her and placed one on her. I made sure to emphasize the importance to her that she has to leave it alone. Though, I am not sure she will remember by the next time I see her. :(


 Hey Red . . . *sigh* Do you sew?? I wonder if you could make a wide, stretchy band to go around her waist. Put a good wide amount of velcro on there and make it so she can't get to the belly. I think they sell something like this to slim your waist. It just goes around the body, you don't need to step into it. If you bought it a size or two too large, it just might work. They have them at Walmart. They sure do find ways to get into trouble!! Just like 5 foot kids!! Hang in there sis!! LOL . . . your gma is a real stitch!! Blessings!


 :) I didn't see I had other replies to my post until now - sorry. Very great ideas - thank you! For the past 2 weeks, my Gma has been on Namenda and so far I can tell a big difference in her. I took her out to lunch today and shopping and she was actually able to remember my MIL's name - which she couldn't do for the past year. She seemed more lucid and not as emotional. So I believe the medicine is working for her. And if that is the case then hopefully she will leave her bags alone now :)


 Get her the diapers or pull ups double or tripple them & go on.She'll never leave the tubing or bag alone.......


 Thanks Snowy and Lyn. Well I went to check out the damage and luckily she only cut the tube for the bag and not the nephrostomy tube. So a new bag can be screwed back on-when it comes in from the pharmacy. I took all the scissors and clippers out of her room so she can't do it again. I told the manager that they may have to go in and check in on her every hour to be sure she isn't messing with the tubing again and to help her change her depends. When I went to see her, I asked her why she cut her tube and she doesn't remember doing it. Sooooo we are going to play it by ear for now. I'm just glad that she didn't cut the nephrostomy tube because that would mean I would have had to schedule surgery for her to have it replaced.


 Hi Red, I don't know much about your situation but is it possibe for your Gma to have a catheter put directly into her urethra that attaches to a bag and then all the urine goes directly into the bag and just has to be emptied. I took care of my Mother for 10 yrs. and she was completely incontinent. Her urethra was like a sieve, no more muscle control so urine just leaked out of her all the time. She eventually started to get UT infections so we had to switch to diapers. I had special adult diapers which I orderd from a medical supply co. and they are much better than what you buy in the store. I also got serenity pads, the maximum strength and put 2 of those inside the diaper and then double diapered her. I got the extra large size even though she was tiny and that way the diaper wrapped around her completely. I also had to limit her intake of fluids. That is not to say she didn't have enough fluid but given her way she would have drunk the ocean if she could. I am sorry you are having such a difficult time. I just wanted to share my experience and see if it might possibly help you. It is true caring and love and commitment when you care for an elderly person. It requires such devotion and knowing how it is all I can say is God love you and bless you. And do take the scissors away. My Mom had some scissors hidden and I found her cutting the diapers off! Gentle hugs, Aurora


 Red you are doing ALL and more than you possibly can YOU are truly a wonderful GD Luvs LYN


 Dear Red 34. you've been so helpful and supportive to me in my plight with my farther, I feel the need to try and help you trouble shoot this problem. If her kidneys are shutting down, is she a candidate for dialysis, or is that premature? My stepmother is in a nursing home because her kidneys shut down, she and I were trained in peritoneal dialysis, we tried to manage her at home, then she started having strokes and since I also had to try and care for my father, there was no way I could take care of them both. Plus the house was falling down around us. Now my stepmother has a ""cycler"" machine which runs all night when she sleeps, it does the job of the kidneys and she has maybe 1/2 cup of urine output daily. This other bag you speak of, could it be wrapped in place with say an elastoplast bandage, and tell her she has a sore (leg, or belly, or whatever) and it has to stay there till it gets better. Or perhaps those back support belts that people use when they have to lift heavy objects, or perhaps a pair of pantyhose (extra large or leggings, maybe in cotton so skin breathes. Or even a pair of old fashioned çombinations (long underwear) For my Gram I found one piece pajammas, because she wouldn't leave her diaper on. I know how much adult diapers cost and feel your pain when you find them torn up or thrown away. I also know the insurance company's are more intent on taking care of their ""bottom lines"" than of caring for people. Love and lot's of luck, to you. I also cared for both my paternal Grandad (non-alzheimers), and paternal gramma, and she did have alzheimers. I used to get so upset by the way she was handled. It's so very, very hard, this road we're all on. Speedbunps at every turn and when things just begin to seem to stabilize, it seems another, worse, unanticipated, obstacle to our efforts, pops up. Some days I feel like throwing in the towel, but, that's not really an option, is it?


 Red How are things with GMA going now?? Has she had a better time of this and YOU too of course I pray both are doing better Keep us doing what you do It shows all others it truly comes from the heart LYN"

Link between Altzheimers & fluoride?,"Hi all, Expect there will be a lot of comments to this but I am brave enough to raise it. Scandanavia and all countries in Europe have stopped adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride is said to make your body absorb extra aluminium. Where does the aluminum go? The brain. And this is the metal that shows up alarmingly in the brains of people with Az. Fluoride is a waste product (some would say poison) from the fertilizer industry. ""Fluoride is known to be more toxic than lead and only slightly less toxic than arsenic. Because of its know toxicity, fluoride powder was at one time used as a dust to kill lice on chickens and as the main toxin in rat baits. There is enough fluoride in one large tube of toothpaste to be fatal to a small child. Toxic levels of fluoride can be visibly seen by fluorosis..... With regard to soft tissue involvement, studies were presented that dealt with neurological lesions (nerve damage). They ascribed paralysis to direct action of fluoride on the central nervous system in addition to the effect of pressure on motor nerves by encroachment of fluorotic bone. Studies also showed that thyroid dysfunction, heart disease and abnormal electrocardiograms and cerebrovascular disease were more prevalent in the prevelant fluorosis areas. An association was shown between chronic fluoride intoxication and lowered intelligence as measured by IQ tests; chromosomal abnormalities; decreased immunity; increased senile cataracts; and cancer. Fluoride is also associated with oesteoporosis - ""Statistically there is a higher incidence of hip fracture in residents of fluoridated areas. This includes U.S. studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Dr. S.J. Jacobsen in 1990 and Christa Danielson and others in 1992."" quoted from Health-Science.","I don't believe that............


 My dad who is in Stage II alzheimers. he left the city, where floride was added to the water supply, and moved to the country where there is a drilled well, no floride. He also wasn't nearly as attentive to brishing as is recommended, ie. he might have brushed one every two or three days, and as a result has very few teeth left in his mouth. Now, as for the aluminum, well, that's another matter. He ate cabbage boiled in an aluminum pot, also boiled everything else in aluminum cookware, most of his life. However, I am still convinced that he inherited the alzheimers from his mother who also had alzheimers. I am beginning to have memory problems, and confusion, but I attribute this to being locked up 24/7/365 with the only other person in my universe being my Dad (an alzheimers victim). It's like the brain waves are contagious. Anyway, it will be interesting to see how others respond.


 I had heard a bit about this but I am very pessimistict(sp) about it all to be honest.........."
Alcohol  and The Efects of a Shrinking brain,"The more alcohol you drink, the more your brain shrinks, a new study has found. Brain volume decreases naturally as people age, at a rate of about 1.9 percent per decade. At the same time, the brain acquires white matter lesions as it gets older. Both of these changes also accompany dementia and cognitive decline, according to background information in the study. Moderate levels of alcohol consumption have been linked with improved cognitive function and a decreased risk in Alzheimers's Alcohol had no protective affect on the normal, age-related shrinkage in brain volume, the researchers found. To the contrary, the more a person drank, the more their brain volume diminished. This relationship was somewhat more pronounced in women, although women tended to be lighter drinkers. The gender difference could be explained by biological factors, namely that alcohol is absorbed faster in women and they tend to feel the effects of alcohol more than men MY mother drank all her life and was not drinking about 6 8 mths prior to passing I find this very interesting and scary as well I am a sober alcoholic since 1979 and there is also some evidence that women that have parent(s) will or actually could possibly get AD........ I was seriously starating to think I was developing AD or a dementia when I was forgetting short term and having probs with short term memory......... My GMA also had Alzheimers on Mom's side........ Dad was my step dad so that will not effect me biologically but still it is pretty darm scary....... Was actually relieved to know the memory was part of my fibro to be honest Take care all and God Bless.......LYN","I also quit drinking and I was a heavy boozer my friend I quit in 79 I am sure it is so hard for you to be in with him 24/7 Have you looked into someone coming in for a couple of hours The Community Access covers it IF doc orders it .......... You need to talk Email me k I am here and I do understand


 Dear Lyn: I drank moderately during the week and heavily on weekends in college. I think that was the norm, certainly back then. I completely quit in 1991 or thereabout s. Went into treatment, the full meal deal. Even tried to help a couple of other ladies along the way. I'm not worried about alzheimers from that experience, I'm not even worried about it from a genetic Paternal Grandmother, now Dad, me looking after him. What I'm worried about is being locked up, isolated, away from people, with him, alone 24/7/ 365. If any factor s affecting my memory, it's surely being so isolated with a being I neither recognise nor understand, it's like those fuzzy little waves of confusion, are in the air."
"Thinking of you, Sis !!","Hey Lyn, Sending out a big hello and hoping you are Sis. Its been a couple days since I've seen any posts and I am worried about you. Prayers coming your way!!

Eating Problems and Disorders That Come From Them.....,"Recently, Nana hasn't been eating very much. All she seems to want is an ice cream cone. Papa took her to the store today so she could pick out her dinner, and come dinner time she didn't want to eat it. We got her to eat about half of the brocoli (it was a lean cuisine thing), but she wouldn't eat the chicken. Tonight she wasn't really eating because she was upset (which went away when the ice cream came out), but this has been going on for about a month or so. Anyone have any suggestions on how to get her to eat? She keeps trying to give her food to the dog. I'm worried about her, because she just picks at her food, then eats ice cream. Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 3/29/2007 9:02:33 AM (GMT-6)","Hi Pixie, Hello Lynne - we found that dad eats SOFT foods better. It's not that he doesn't like meat - it's that he doesn't like the texture. So we go for soft meats (or cook them in a ""soft"" way.) Also we put LESS on the plate so it doesn't overwhelm him. We also found that cutting his food for him in thin small bites helps him. He ""can"" cut his own food - but isn't hungry enough to want to bother sometimes. Let me know what works for YOU. :) If he like Nanna likes ice cream - maybe she would like Instant Breakfast or other dietary shakes.


 Make your own shakes with Carnation instant breakfast. i've tasted ensure,boost,they are yukky.


 The time will come when anything she'll eat is ok.Even just ice cream.


 Her appetite will go,refuse to eat,or she won't be able to swallow towards the end.Some people have feeding tubes inserted,thinking it gives them a better life,but it doesn't,it just prolongs death,can cause undo infections,they get clogged up then have to be reinserted with a new tube.My way of thinking is NOT the way I would want to end life.


 I don't think she'd let us feed her. Her favorite thing to eat is peanut butter and banana sandwiches. I swear, she's had one everyday for lunch for the past 61 years. I'm not sure about cereals. Most of the foods she seems to like now a days are sweet. For Christmas, my mom bought a few tins of chocolate covered caramel covered popcorn. I'm thinking she might just not feel hungry at night, because when I go over for lunch she's always eating her sandwich.


 Yep. :)


 Hello everyone. I am glad that I saw this. My elder sister has early dementia,she is 55 now but was diagnosed about 4 years ago i think. She was always a very healthy eater but we have found that just lately she is only interested in sweets and cakes. She is coming here tomorrow and I am not sure what to give her to eat. The Doctor has said as long as she is eating somthing then that is better than nothing,but she has realy started to lose weight. It's worrying. Sue


 Some people with AD can eat evertyhing plus more & still lose weight.AD does that,you can't stop it.I gained up to 183lbs.I'm now at 155 4 months later.But them I'm not a good eater anymore.


 My taste for sweets went out the door too,lol.


 Also,If your loved one has Pernisious Anemia without intrinsic factor as I do,that can cause your appetite to go south.I'm taking a medication & it's makes me hungry.Since I also have IBS I have to be careful & eat small meals.I cut my food up small,it's easier to eat.I'm not the meat eater I once was either.


 My nan absolutly loves ice cream and anything sweet! She has a stash of chocolate and sweets beside her chair lol! I was getting worried about her only eating messes and icecream, not so worried now been reading this thread, thanks.


 At some point if loved one is at home using a bottle will get some nutrition into them as well ...Padraig uses this Method for Jean and it works well for them .... You can use a blender to make the food soft and pureed for easy feeding if they have problems as well


 That's normal for the AD patient to do this. My appetite started going away before I was dx in 1996. I eat very little now compared to the way I used to eat,really don't get hungry anymore. Many with AD crave sweets,My taste for sweets left years ago,things I loved taste too sweet now. I have become VERY picky at what I eat,has to be just so,so before I eat it. Then there are those who can't get enough to eat,eat all the time.


 Nana used to eat a lot before this past month. Now she just wants sweet things, especially ice cream. I'll try cutting up her food. She really likes chicken, so maybe we'll try making more chicken dishes. The thing is, she'll pick out what she wants, be all excited about dinner, runs around the house asking when dinner is, and sets the table, then gets everyone to the table, then doesn't eat. I guess she just likes dinner time now because everyone's together. I was thinking about those dietary shakes, because those are pretty sweet, too. I think I'll give those a try. Thanks for the suggetions. :)


 Nana and Papa went to her doctor one time, and they were there so long that the doctor gave them some Ensure shakes. They liked them and bought some of their own. But that was months ago. I told Papa about the shake idea, and he went to the store and forgot to get them. Maybe next time. She ate her dinner tonight, though! Carnation is goooood!


 What do you mean?


 Hi Pixie - Hi Snowy, Good topic. Sounds kind of dahhh but depending how little your loved one is eating - they may allow you to spoon feed them. Dad likes any kind of attention. He fusses with his shoe laces to get someone to touch him. He loves it if I help him adjust his socks or lotion his dry skin. :) I ""find"" spots on his arms that ""need"" lotion too. He loves it. Glad Nanna likes the shakes. They do sell those in a large container of dry powder - that is probably the least expensive way to get them. Dad likes shakes too. Does Nanna like cereal ? Some cereals are good ""finger food"" Nanna might like to munch those even w/o milk. Healthy snack and EASY.


 PB and Bananas are excellant!!! (hmmmm soft and sweet) a little milk w/that sandwich and she has a complete protein


 Spoon feeding is great,but when the can't swallow anymore all that will happen is aspirating the food,then getting pneumonia...........


 Hide the sweets,give her good wholesome food.............


 SNAPPLE MAKES A GOOD MEAL REPLACEMENT DRINK. STRAWBERRY BANANA IS YUMMY. MOM SAYS ""THIS IS GOOD"" (AND BELIEVE ME THAT IS SOMETHING) HER APPETITE IS GONE. TRY IT.


 My Dad was a sweet fanatic now he is off most except the "" Bosten creme donuts from Timmy's Personally I am glad but he is losing weight a rapid pace even though eating really healthy .... I think it is a grief thing with him ......as well as the AD as Snowy says LYN


 Snowy ANY more info on this would be appreciated I changed title of Thread to add Problems that arise from Eating Problems ..... Any other input you have is always appreciated Luvs LYN


 Glad it put you at ease You can make her some milkshakes with ensure or boost as well as ice cream to help with nutrition ...."
LTC Decisions and Facilities,"How does one decide the appropriate time to place an alzheimer's victim in a LTC facility? My Dad isn't at that stage yet, I don't believe, but he may be beginning to have bowel incontinence (is this a symptom of Alzheimers?). I don't think he will co-operate to have his bowel examined ie: sigmoidoscopy. He's become fearful and avoidant of Doctors and hospitals. Also, do Alzheimer's victims always have to be locked up. I heard of two nursing homes in our area where, rather than lock them in (a locked unit) they have ""watchers"" who hover around and redirect a seemingly lost confused or angry resident. My dad is six foot four and very strong. I don't know how well he'll take ""redirection"". Any imput is welcome.","HI there Upon going in to a home there will be an assessment done and from there they will decide where to put dad I worked in a Nursing home eons ago where we had open walk about areas for severe AD pll but the 3rd floor was a locked security ward for AD I did not take a liking to that at all But it was not my home When I had my own we had bracelets put on patients and we never lost one ,,,,, Incontinince is part of growing old as well as Alzheimers or there very well could be a medical factor I wish you all the best and DO hope you will continue to post and stay with us Red has given great input to you as wel Luvs LYN


 I knew the time came to place my Gma in a center is when she was doing odd things in the middle of the night as well as opening doors. I was afraid that she may wander off on me at night. It also came down to the fact that I just couldn't handle it anymore because my own health was suffering as well as the emotional impact it was having on my family (my kids and hubby). So I found a really good assisted living center for her. This place allows them freedom to roam but there are doors that are security locked so they can't wander outside. It has an inner court yard so they can go outside anytime. I think that you will know when is the right time to place your father in a home. Every one is different on how much they can handle. Incontinence can be from various things especially diverticulosis which is very common in the elderly. Does you father take fiber or eat alot of fruits and veggies?"
.....HELLO.......Some Questions and Observations ..........,"Hello, My mother was diagnosed with an over-active thyroid and had treatment for it. Before this happened, we noticed that she was losing weight, was very nervous and and if I took her shopping, I had to stay close to her. She did not want to go to the doctor and it took my brother and I awhile to convince her to go. Looking back it doesn't seem like very much time had passed after the thyroid problem until one night coming home from her sister's, she somehow ended up in a town miles away. This was the first time anything like this had ever happened. My brother noticed that she could no longer handle paying her bills, They live together. And when she cooked, she would leave out ingredients or put in things that were not supposed to there. So, my brother began doing all of the cooking, for the last five years, he has done everything for her and taken care of the aparment. I take her out sometimes and take her for her doctor's appointments, etc. I don't know if she has dementia or alzheimer's and her doctor told me that they were about the same thing. Mother is 85 now and sleeps most of the time day and night, when she gets up, she sits at the table and drinks coffee or watches television. She doesn't remember many people anymore. She knows her children, but not her grandchildren. I recently bought a card for a relative and she kept reading it out loud every few minutes. If she asks a question, she will ask it again a few minutes later and then again. I guess this is normal behavior for people who have this kind of illness. The only thing she will eat is cheese crackers with peanut butter inside and chocolate candy. When I take her out to eat, she always orders pancakes or biscuits and gravy and when I take her home, she will sleep for hours, it just seems to wear her out. Also, she walks very slowly, her steps are like baby steps and it takes a long time for us to get inside when we get out of the car. I wondered if these are all things that people who have alzheimer's do. She doesn't take a bath anymore so someone has to bathe her and wash her hair. Yet, when her two sisters come over she can play cards with them. I have no idea how she can remember how to play cards. She remembers more about her childhood and parents then she does about getting married and raising a family. Our dad passed away years ago, but she doesn't know who he is when we show her his picture and has no memory of him. I wonder if there are stages to alzheimer's and what we might expect as time goes by. Thank you, Wiggyann","I would suggesst taking her to a Neuroligist to be tested for all /any types of dementia Read thru some other threads as well Stay with us .........LYN


 i wrote a reply but it got lost in netherspace, I guess. So, again. Sounds like alzheimers but also could be stroke. You need to get her medically assessed so when things continue to slide there is someone, legally bound to make decisions for her, Enduring Power of Attorney. ASAP. While she can still make an informed decision."
holidays and mother w/lewy bodies,"First, thank you all for your support! had really nice Thanksgiving w/friend and going out to dinner. that morning, i took communion to mother and 2 other ladies in the nursing home, and it went well. Already making some tentative plans for Xmas, so not as scared. Some progress on mother to report ... for a change. she was somewhat awake when i visited, and was able to answer questions about whether she remembered a friend and a cousin who check with me about her. had family conference where nurses reported that mother is somewhat more awake than she has been and aware of what is going on around her. seems the less they medicate her, the better she's feeling. Her general health is good. Was told i could attend family holiday dinner, and they'd take her to the dining room with an aid to feed her the liquids. I'll pass on this. May visit on holiday, but that's all i can do. linda",Linda This is all great news I am so happy that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving You do deserve it my friend........ Also I am very pleased your Mom is showing more progress I sometimes think that overmedicating is a big problem Keep me posted hun I think of you and you Mom often LYN Prayers and thoughts are with you and your Mother God Bless LYN
When Seeing A Doctor,"...First and foremost let the doctor KNOW if your loved one is capable of hearing and ""getting "" what he is saying They are NOT invisible entity's in this just because they have this DD STages are so different with so many and many a time I have Heard where a person will go in AND they are talked about AS IF they are not EVEN there SO WRONG IMHO........ IF they are capable of getting involved in the TX the better it may be as I see it If the doctor is rushed and literally pushes you out the door CHANGE DOCTORS.......... Our seniours deserve BETTER tretment and respect Sometimes they will feel more ""intune and proud "" of the fact they are brought into the whole discussion Ask your loved one prior to going There just may be some questions THEY may have that they have not brought out to us And if they are with it enough they should be allowed to advocate to a point for selves THIS is soley my opinion.............LYN","BUmping for Wiggy


 ** When you have to be the advocate make sure you are the best one for your loved one DEMAND to know what meds loved one is on Demand to know what is or may be coming next with loved one Find out WHAT you can do to help loved ones if they live with you ALL PERTINENT info is needed to be answered Write questions down first before you go........ BE THERE FOR THEM AS I KNOW YOU WANT TO BE Again just my opinion...LYN"
When do you have them evaluated for Alzheimers?,"My gma has been getting worse. She has not been diagnosed yet with Alzheimers or any other form of dementia but her mind is definately going somewhere. I am sort of depressed writing this because when my gma moved in with me 3 years ago, she had all of her mental faculties. But within those 3 years, her mental state has slowly been declining. At what point do you take your loved ones to see a doctor for this? Who would I take her too, who would I talk to? She has a universal insurance so she can go almost anywhere. Plus I have the problem of approaching her with this problem. She doesn't feel there is anything wrong with her mind or her actions. Some of the latest things she has been doing is emotional outbursts such as crying over something silly one minute to being elated the next. She is at loss for words like today, she was trying to tell me she was washing a quilt but she couldn't think of the word quilt so she said that fluffy thing over there (this is just an example because there are more words she is at a loss for). If she is in unfamiliar territory, her confusion is more profound. My hubby even seen her the other day pocketing her pills - so I've been keeping an eye on her since then. She is always losing things in her room and I would help her tear her room apart to look for it only to find it in the most unusual places. I believe the time is approaching for me to seek help for her but I'm at a loss as to where to start.","Thanks, I thought so, but how would I approach her to get her to the doctors? Should I tell her the truth or lie to get her in there?


 Red I totally agree with Snowy on this and my heart thoughts and prayers are with you This is a DD that robs us so quickly of those we love Keep us posted hun please and get her there anyway you are able as Snowy posted Sometimes we have to tell little fibs to get them proper care ....... Sounds like she needs it now .. I am so sorry Luvs LYN


 Wow,the anesthetic can also cause problems if she does have dementia.Clue in the surgeon if you can at the poss.she has dementia............


 For sure make sure they KNOW she may have Demetia It will and can make it worse This may also be a a good time to have Neurologist...Geriontologist ........check her out My heart thoughts and prayers are with you and her Luvs LYN


 Please keep us informed Red In my heart thoughts and prayers So happy surgury went well for your GMA Luvs LYN


 BUMPING for RED to see how she is doing LYN


 Ya me too Snowy ...........better for her all around IMHO................. Take care LYN


 i can say from experience in seeing what happens to other caregivers if the don't take time for themselves. 65% die befroe the LO as they either won't can't or refuse to take respite time away from the person with dementia.The sooner you get her evaluated & get her on meds.the better.If you wait too long they may not help.You may have to take a hard line with her or she will never let you go.


 Thanks Lyn and Snowy. I can't rely on my brothers to care for my gma until I get better. They're heavy alcoholics unfortunately. No other family either. My husband can help while he is here but he works afternoons so he's not much help when it comes to gma. I have no one really to call for back up. I have a procedure scheduled in October that may cure most of my woes so when that is over I plan on taking her in.


 The first thing you should do is see her Primary Doctor then have them either refer you to a memory loss doctor to have an MRI done and bloodwork with that they should be able to let you know what's what and what you can do I have been going through the same with my aunt and we waited a long time years with just saying she keeps forgetting things, she repeats herself, she put the phone in the fridge instead of hanging it up etc, etc all because no one wanted to face the facts and handle the situation I know it's very difficult but there are meds to help her and the longer you wait the more things progress you want to at least be able to enjoy her a bit longer so getting the correct meds are the key dosage and meds take a while to find the right dosage and medicine . My aunt was diagnosed in january 2008 and has progressed quickly because she doesn't want to take her meds. I will be very honest I understand that you might be the only once to care for your grandmother but you are going to need some help because it is very, emotionally, physically, mentally and fiancially draining you need a break or you will be no good to no one even if its just to talk to some one. Good Luck and if you need to talk or have any questions let me know. Keep me posted on everything.PR Glo


 BUMP


 I know you will do all you can and have for her Red YOU are great and I wish more were like you with their loved ones Respecfully Your friend LYN


 Make an appointment with her family Dr then as for a referral to a Neurologist for testing.There are meds out they that can help her.


 Maybe you can tell her her insurance wants her to have a check up.The truth would cause you the biggest headache you've ever had.You'll learn to tell little fiblets as time goes by.Make any excuse you can to get her to the Dr.It might be good if you can talk to his nurse telling her what's going on as you don't want to address this in front of her at the Drs.Write down everything she does,can or cannot do then give it to the nurse & she can let the Dr know ahead of time what's going on......I would do this ASAP!


 Thanks so much! She has surgery scheduled tomorrow for a kidney nephrostomy tube and kidney stent replacement in which she may be in the hospital for a little bit. But as soon as she recovers from that, I will take her in to her family doc.


 The last time she had surgery on her bladder she definately had a reaction to the anesthia. She was very delirious and out of it - that was the first time I had seen her that bad. Kind of freaked me out a bit. Eventually she came out of it but it took about 4 days. But I will bring this up to the doc too.


 Her surgeries went well and I talked to the anesthia doc about her mental confusion with general anesthia so he did a spinal block on her instead. She came out and she was mentally ""intact"". We were there for a long time and she thought she was there for over a day but other then that, she did real well. When she's feeling better, I am going to take her to the family doc to see where he recommends I take her for evaluation.


 How is your GMA doing Red........


 Glad the Dr did a spinal on her..........


 Sorry Lyn - I just seen that you asked about my gma's welfare. Health wise she is doing subperb - no more infections in her bladder or kidneys. Her tubes are great though she did spring a leak in her kidney bag - oh what a nightmare trying to find a replacement! I haven't taken her in for evaluation yet because I've had some health issues of my own that I'm trying to contend with. It makes it hard on me because I am her sole caregiver but I know that if the caregiver is ill then the caregiver will be of no use to the care receiver. Mentally she still has her moments of confusion. She also is quite sad lately because she has no friends and she sits in her room or hides in the yard and cries. I feel so bad when she has these moments because there is really nothing for me to do. I have looked into senior centers but all the activities they do require sight and my gma is almost blind due to macular degeneration. I even mentioned to my gma about the possibility of moving into an assisted living senior community (that has Alzheimers and Dementia care) where she could be with her peers but she didn't want that. She doesn't want to leave me nor did I want her to really, I want to make her happy. Do you have any suggestions as to what craft she would be able to do that doesn't require much vision? I think that if I gave her something to do or make that it make her a bit happier.


 Red I am in total agreement with Snowy 'I looked after Mom til she passed and now am looking after dad Unfortunately .....I have gotten pneumonia so I HAD to call the other siblings to come hellp ......they dont look after him IMHO like they should but I will be getting better with resting Please get her evaluted as soon as you ARE feeling better hun and PLEASE let us know LUVS LYN


 I hear ya about the alcoholics in the family most in mine are as well .........I have been sober now since 1979 ............... I am glad Hubby can help but you knoew your self IF you get too stressed out over all of this you will not be having the procedure........Right?? Please know YOU are part of the AD family as well hun and we want to know how your GMA is as well as you .......... My heart thoughts and prayers are with you on this procedure as well about a craft......have you thought of having her do a Collage of BIG pics of the family ,kids grandkids ect pets .......all of it on a piece of bristol board too may be a thought ........ I will bump a thread we did a couple yrs back on some crafts and things we did ......hoping something will help out Take care hun and remember we are here for you Luvs LYN.


 I looked after BOTH parents and I was okay even when sick I still muddled thru YES you need to be able to look after self as well ...IMHO Red I know this has to be heartbreaking for you Know we do think of you and her daily and I am always sending out lotsa love and prayers LYN


 do INSIST on the gp referring her to a specialist. when my mother was beginning to ""lose it"" i called her gp and he had her go in for a blood pressure check. she seemed fine at the time, so the doctor and i dropped any further checks. about 2 weeks later, she got in her car and wound up a few states away. she went into a nursing home where she was diagnosed w/lewy bodies dimentia. i regret not being more forceful about getting a diagnosis for her sooner. linda"
My Aunt is Deteriorating Quickly!!!!!,"I don't know if this is normal for Alzheimers I need input from you guys. Please help!!!! Need Advise??????I am her CareTaker My Aunt Talks to herself constantly. My Aunt Wanders Off and gets lost. My Aunt has no short term memory at all. My Aunt doesn't remember dates, days of the week. My Aunt foregets she has taken her meds and when I give them to her tells me I already took them. My Aunt forget she eats sometimes and either won't eat or eats twice. My Aunt locks all doors and hides and hoards everything no matter what it is and what condiiton it's in she doesn't want to get rid of it. My Aunt forgets to change her clothes. My Aunt forgets to Bathe. And lastly and the most recently new thing My Aunt is using the bathroom on herself I have to wash her clothes 3 and 4 times a day #2 I spoke to her Doctor he said I should consider putting depends on her. Please advise is this all normal is she in the end stages I know nothing about Alzheimers only the little bit I've readu up on. Thanks PR Glo","Before my Gma was placed on meds she would talk to herself constantly as well but just under her breath or she would talk to the TV. She also had a problem with her short term. Even after being on Nemenda she still doesn't know the date, how old she is or what day of the week it is. But that is ok because it's not harming anyone as far as I'm concerned and it's one of those little things that can be overlooked. My Gma has been wearing Depends for a while now and it really does help alot with her accidents. When she was living with me, she would have accidents but she would clean herself up. But now that she is in the home and a bit worse mentally, she is unable to clean herself suffienctly so the staff helps her. But it sounds like your Aunt needs a bit more supervision now that it seems her condition is going downhill. Like for instance, does your aunt eat with you? Does she live with you? If she lives alone then it's best to get her in a home or moved in with someone to keep an eye on her.


 ....My Cait was the best one to get thru to Mom as well My dad didnt want Cait to see him ........... as he was ... But she did and it was her POPPA......she so loved him still cries alot in her sleep as do I Yes it is hard on all involved in the caretaking but also it is rewarding IMHO


 Pro Glo IMHO Yes this is totally normal for AD It gets hardfer to watch what our loved ones go thru and also harder for us as Caregivers to see all of this happening and basically our loved ones especially parents and close relatives ( Like Aunties) going back to the the childlike stage Depends will help you with the amount of laundry and changing clothes you may end up with a tad of an problem having Mom keep them on........ I would also ask her doc to have a NUEROLOGIST see and access her completely I found it difficut in all honesty to put them o my Mom it seemed so sad but I know you are the only one that does anything and I do think that is your best option You can call Alzheimers Organization and have her registered and a bracelt made for wandering Talking to themselves is a normal habit as well .........the same with eating you have to remind them and also with meds...... Short term memory is also a loss to most with AD......... It sure sounds like all of it is hitting your aunt and in turn you and brother....... I wish you the best and iff you want to talk plz email me or add me to Msn or yahoo God Bless you LYN


 I know that watching someone with Alzeheimers is hard. My mother-in-law recently passed away from Alzeheimers. Her doctor said that because she had no other health problems, we would actually see the worst of Alzeheimers. The things you are noticing, are very normal. When my MIL lived with us, I was her caretaker. The hardest thing was keeping her in the house at night and getting her to take her meds. Many times having someone else offer her food or her meds (my 8 year old son was my ""other person"") helps. She wouldn't ever tell him no, anything he brought grandma she would do."
getting it off my chest,"I'm really struggling here. My Dad's wife (my stepmother) had to go to hospital yesterday, to register for a total hip replacement, due for surgery, tomorrow. I had to leave my dad at the hhouse as drywaller was supposed to come to work on basement, (Dad has Alzheimers), and my son and my large dog had to come. My son to help lift her, she's over 200lbs. and has no strength in arms or legs. Large dog had to come because she is not good with strangers (unless I'm present to make introduction, then she is fine). I always leave my cell #, plus several neighbor's tel. #'s on phone (taped) so if dad has any problems he can call me or a neighbor for help. I didn't have much choice in the matter as it is a small car and wheelchair had to fit in also. Soooo, Dad and I discussed it at length prior to finalizing plans and said he agreed, it would be best for him to stay at home with his little dog to greet the drywallers. Off we went. I ran as fast as I could through the admtting process but we all know how that goes. It took nearly four hours from arrival at hospital untill the bed was ready for stepmom. Then we had to return her wheelchair to the nursing home. Finally, we arrived home at 7:45 PM and my dad came out of his room ready to have a massive tantrum. According to him, some strange lady (that would be me) ran off in his car (my car) and left him stranded all day.The drywaller situation is completely out of my hands because we rent. I know many will say I need respite etc. but they are not always available in thse types of circumstances. While held up at the hospital for four hours, I would be worrying about getting back to relieve the respite worker that would just add to the stress. Usually, i can manage being sole caregiver, and POA for both Dad and his wife, but yesterday, all needed me at the same time. That's where I need a clone. thanks for letting me get that off my chest.","Thank-you Lyn: Sometimes I feel like my life is on fast forward and I can't find the pause button. God did give me strength in the form of my son coming to help out this week. Alas he has to go home tomorrow as he starts a new job Monday. At least for the time he has been here he's been available to supervise Dad from about 2 PM till dad's ready for bed around 7:30 - 8:00 PM. That's another blessing, dad goes to bed early enough that I get a couple hours of ""me time"" from dad's bedtime till I turn in around 10:00 PM. I usually just watch some of my favorite shows which Dad describes as ""disgusting"", the CSI trio, Criminal minds and so on. I cannot watch them in the living room as he gets worked up so while my son is here, I can watch them from my bedroom. Dad did something the night before last, that was extremely rude. As my son is on vacation, he often stays up late watching TV. Apparently, Dad came out while my son was watching TV and just walked over and turned the set off. My son just stared at him, incredulously, speechless. It wasn't that the TV was disturbing dad, we keep a ""white noise"" generator on at night outside his room because he goes to bed so early, we're not going to tippy toe around. I rent this house through my disability cheque. Dad is a guest here. he really steps out of line, sometimes, and I correct him. Not that it's so gall darn important but rather that when he eventually ends up in a long term care facility he will have some regard for others. His wife who is presently having hip surgery, today, allowed him to yell at her, be disrespectful towards her, and verbally abusive towards her. He doesn't know how to be civil to females. He's gotten away with that behavior for far to long. He will be at the mercy of primarily female caregivers once he is placed and he won't get very far being rude and not watching his tongue, when dealing with female caregivers. I think partially, his action towards my son was to try to drive him off so Dad could have complete control over me (isolating me from my supports). I don't think he's even aware he's doing it, he's been doing it that way for ages. I have set down some ultimatums for my two sibs regarding our somewhat desperate situation, they may respond as they please. If they don't hop aboard the bandwagon and get involved in Dad's care, I, who have POA, will take it upon myself to do whatever needs to be done in order to save myself and see that Dad is adequately cared for. Thanks again, for listening.


 You are bang on as always, Lyn. I can't even get a response by email or by phone as to which way to go from here. I sure as heck will once I do make a decision and they will claim they weren't consulted. My sister is already threatening to sue me, for what, I have no idea. She has called me a thief and a liar for some of the things I've sold in order that we can just keep our heads above water. Best of luck to her. I have friends in low places, also. My brother is just totally aloof. No yes, do that, no no, don't do that, nothing. Just the occasional email about what if and when the land sells and Öh by the way, say hello to Dad for me"".


 I certainly have records indicating that when Dad's wife went to the nursing home she left $2000.00 per month in automatic withdrawls from the account each month, and Dad's cheques are $1300.00. Therefore, there was approx. $700.00 shortfall between what was owed and what income was coming in. My contribution from my disability pays the rent on the house we now live in as well as some groceries and gas. I have tons of documentation. None of Dad's drugs are even included in the $2000 that goes out automatically each month. So if they're actively interested in knowing about the shortfall, it's not hard to pinpoint, just view what comes in vs. what goes out.I did unload the leased truck as it was costing about $700.00 per month and replaced it with an old beater the repairs I do myself. That loosened up a bit of the financial crunch, $700.00 per month. therefore we just break even. But drugs for Dad, enough of the proper foods, gas to go visit stepmom all need to be covered. They can make what they will out of that. Ain't family grand?


 Everyone used to love camping with me. I always has two tents(one for me and the pitbull, one for stragglers0. Three types of insect repellant, half a dozen flashlight way extra batteries, extra cookstove, tons of extra drinking water, fire starteR, extra wine (don't drink anymore) extra food, and first aid kits, you name it. That's the way I am untill this day. Got all my pokers in the fire. While the sibs battle over our joint property, I have full control of family farm and whatever is inside. That is what I'll be selling to get dad appropriate housing. Once back taxes are paid and bank is settled, anything else goes to better housing for dad. They can kick and scream till they're blue iin the face, that's how it;s going down. Had a really tough day, somehow, very stressful. Back to, how the heck am I going to get through the next three weeks? Something always comes up, iy;s just a lot of work.


 TYNO I will not say what you think I am going to That you need a time for self I will say that it is good that you have gotten all this off your chest and I do hope that tomorrow will be a better day I dont want to say anything else except I believe you are doing the work of a few ppl plus God give you strength...........LYN


 I think setting boundaries and guidlines for siblings is a dang good idea and if they dont pull up then by all means you take the lead and Do what is best for you .....your family and your dad I was in the same boat with mine as you prolly know already They never cared at all til it was done nd over and the wills were coming out I still get msn messages 's IF house has been sold Not how are you making out ya know 'Ticks me right off I hear ya for sure it is so hard to go at this as you are Thank God you are spelled for a bit .......... Take care of you plz LYN


 ..IF it were I ( and I did ) I would keep a log of all the things you had to sell in order to give the best to your Dad.........where the monies went ect YOU should NOT have to do this but in this case and in mine I found it necessay so that the siblings knew SINCE they could not or would not visit and see for self I found this the best way to go about it I truly am sorry you are going thru this ' At times like this it should bring a family / siblings closer But alas in our situations it did not SAD but true Remember you are doing right by your dad..........NOT them........... God Bless LYN


 YOU said it sister............ Yep they sure are grand especially when the wills come out and monies are supposed to be disbursed I wish I was the type that could hold the monies up for a LONGGGGGG period of time I just know my Mom N Dad would not be happy at all with the weay things are going with the family/ siblings I a,m so glad you have had your thinking Cap on sis It is always good to be prepared Yep I was a boy scout lol........ Loves LYN"
Padraig......My Wife....My Story ..Part 2,"Hi Lyn, Mary, Linda and fellow carers. Yesterday I tried to post, but couldn't make it, felt like the Irishman who's tombstone has: ""I told you I was Ill"", that's true in fact! and is written in Gaelic. I told you I knew nothing about computers. Isn't strange, how people who have little or no experience of caregiving for a loved one, think they know all the answers. If asked, what I find the most difficult aspect of caring, it has to be, the frustration of having to deal with people totaly lacking in comprehending what loving caregiving is all about . In my case, I have the good fortune to be a Lone Stray, therefore ideally suited to go it alone. The down side is, no one ever offers to help in some small way. Though, no doubt I'd turn it down, but it would be nice to have the offer. Medical people keep well away because we are doing fine. Family members think I'm capable of taking on anything and mastering it. My fault I know. Linda, thank you for the advice, but I'm not sure if you understood, Jean can't move any part of her body. She's stiff all over except for one hand. When I strap her in the W/chair I lift one arm up to place the strap around her waist, I hold her other arm up by gripping the sponge she holds in my teeth, in order to clip the strap togeather. Each leg I have to lift to fasten to the chair. She's also a dead weight when turning over in bed. If you can imagine dressing and undressing a doll, you got it. I know people in Jean's condition are kept bed ridden, as she was years ago in the NH. So long as she's eating and drinking well, then I'll keep doing things my way. Linda, I'm real concerned for your girl, sounds like a very brave one. Please God, everything is OK for you both. Mary, could it be a sign of age when we wonder why the younger ones can't understand the damage they do, by disrespecting their elders. You are being challanged, aren't you? by seven! Who's on your side? There appears to be light at the end of the tunnel, with a place at the private hospital. You can fight the good fight, with Irish blood you'll make it. God willing everything will turn out fine. Lyn, I'm so sorry to learn of your Dad's condition. But you know by now AD is no rose garden without just as many weeds. I love the red roses, when I 'dead head' them, new ones soon come along, just like bad and good days with AD. Often the siblings are more conserned about their feelings, rather than focusing on the vunerable loved one's welfare. This time will pass, you'll reach calmer waters. Then you might ask why did I lose sleep over it? It solved nothing. Be strong and don't let them win. I'm praying for you. May your God go with you. Padraig","Hi Lyn, I find it very sad that siblings bicker over a loved one's care. Somehow I feel your Dad can pick up the bad vibes, just as children do when there's tension between parents. Just as in the case with a child, the stress and confusion caused, will affect your Dad's condition. As you rightly say, keep yourself on the high moral ground, by being nice and polite, but firm. I would be inclined to consider any input by way of help.You have, after all been the main carer for both your Mom and Dad, so your best placed to make the final decision. Who should know what's best? I wish you well, you are in my thoughts and prayers. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Have all the rest of the members in my heart thoughts and Prayers......... Luvs LYN


 Dear Lyn, Padraig and Linda and everyone, Thank you all for your posts and kind wishes and prayers. They must be working because I'm moving with more equanimity through the days (that is, most days). You're right, Linda, about forgiveness being necessary in families. These are not my children, and they resent me as an intruder, hence the hostility on their part. The best I can do so far is to say that they are not bad people, but very sick people, and I'm trying to view them with tolerance, pity and compassion. I want to tell you that it takes a lot of effort of my part! I'm pretty tired. My husband will be moving into the residence of his choice in a week: I hope that he will be happier there. Yesterday, for the first time, a little of my guilt fell away that I wasn't taking care of him at home. It's when I realized that he was going for several long walks a day down the long hallways in the private hospital, something he hasn't done for the past 4 years at home; the layout of the house and furniture doesn't allow it. It's good to see him become more active. Lots of love to all, Mary


 Dear Padraig, Thanks, as always, for your encouraging words. They help. Love from Mary.

But I feel just awefull that you are getting MORE guff from your sibs!! I am going to sign off and pray a mighty prayer for your protection and for their eyes to be opened to the truth of what is really going on with your Dad. Urghhhhhh . . . its always the main caretaker that gets all this guff from the ones who do nothing to help. Sorry, I'm done venting now . . . I just hope you are not pushed into another flare with soars and all. Please know that I'm thinking of you sis. God is still in charge . . . so I need to stop seething.

 Thank you my sweet friend I had you in my head last night thinking ""what would he say"" lol I Am not going to let them make me stressed to the point of an IV and sores again ....I refuse to sink to their level I know in my mind and my HEART I have done and am doing what is best for Dad ........they can think what they like I am the eldest yet I am not his Biological daughter and the only one that is is the youngest sister who had nothing to do with Mom til she passed and now is starting to pull her "" blood"" with me routine It wont work He is my father .....any man can be a DAD it takes a SPECIAL man like him to come in and take over 3 kids and not once has he ever treated me differently than being his blood........and to be a FATHER I have all the memories good and some bad yes but still I have them ....... He has lost so much weight no matter with what I have him eating it is pretty scary and he states he will not go back to the Doctor ....he says he is tired and wants to be with his Judy ....... I think as I have said before he will go from a broken and lonley heart for Mom......... God will make him Better ......... I dont want to lose him at all I just know time is coming.......... Take care my mentor and my friend Butterfly Kisses andd God Bless Luvs LYN


 I totally agree about Dad being able to feel the Vibes .......I know he does and it hurts him no matter what ppl may think he still has a heart and feelings as you know ...... I am not going to sink to the level of making arguments you are so right I do know what has been going on with him and as I did with Mom ........I know what he wants and doesnt want BUT I am also open to their suggesstions providing they are not against his wishes ,...which I have in writing from prior to his decline and notarized....... I will keep you posted my friend as always ...............on to some other news...... Cait started her Job at the Hospital last night and feel in love with an 80 yr old lady that had just had surgury and has dementia...........she is very happy with what she is doing at the hospital and I am so proud of her she told us last night that one Nurse had come in and apparently had gotten very rude with this Lady saying to stop her "" yelling and carrying on "" as she continually does it .......so needless to say Cait DID report to her supervisor about the incident and I AM PROUD of her ....there is absolutely no CAUSE for a Nurse to act like that and Cait has been taught this from young age being in My retirement home and how ppl were treated there.....she works again tonight and then goes back on Monday .I did tell her that she needs to space all her time and make sure she has Free time for herself as she is young and so serious about all of her committments ...which is good for sure but like I know I am sure she will need the ""down time"" Cait was also told ""not to get close to PPL"" ..........I do not believe in that either for me I feel you have to have some heart for the profession .....not just be there for the money .......I expressed my self and feelings to Cait which she already knew anyways so she said it made her feel better knowing she was right to "" CARE"" I wish that more ppl would know it takes love and caring to be in the Health Care Field....... Education is the Key I truly believe ......... Anyways I had to share with you my Cait's first Day at her Job.........It is Community service that is required for High School not a paying job but her REWARDS will be better than any monies she would recieve ...In my honest opinion........ Butterly Kisses to G Jean and you Anniversary is sneaking up on you's ...I know the date I remember it well ......as I know you are waiting for it too Love God BLess LYN


 Greetings All, First of all, you are correct Padraig that I did not understand the extent of Jean's immobility. I surely hope I did not cause offense of any kind in my advice about the clothing. I know you have continued to be an exceptional caregiver for your wife and that you had probably already heard of alterations that might help in dressing, but on the off chance you had not I decided to give those tips. I admire your valiant and loving efforts to do everything possible to keep Jean with you, despite what others might consider as someone who might as well just be bedridden as you said. Every moment she is with her family and suroundings is another postive day for her. Again, apologies if my advice seemed insensitive in any way. Lyn, you are sounding stressed and that is worrisome. What you are doing cannot be easy and although you never complain, it is evident that this takes a toll on you, as it would anyone! Please take care of yourself. I don't want to think that you will have to bond again with that IV. You have better friends than that to spend time with!! (When I was undergoing chemotherapy and wore an IV via a pic line for months, I named the IV bag FRED, the same name my daughter gave her IV bag when she was in the hospital as a very little girl with severe e-coli.) FRED may have been someone I had to try to think of as a friend and not an enemy, but losing that particular ""friend"" was not sorrowful! I love hearing in your ""voice"" your enthusiasm about Cait and what she is doing. Your pride is so well deserved; she sounds like a wonderful young lady! Following in her mom's footsteps it appears Mary, I think of you so often and pray every day that family is giving you a little relief from their interferences that have made things so difficult for you. It is surprising when family chooses not to just let go of grievances of any kind and instead pull together for the collective good of the fmaily member in need. I think I have said this before in a post, but a mantra of sorts that I have used at many times in my life as a mom, wife, ex-wife, daughter and sister is ""At the end of every day a family should be able to forgive one another."" Oh my, though, there were days, years, months, when I didn't think I would ever be able to do that. I had to, to move on and be able to enjoy my family, as dysfunctional as it is at times. You, however, seem to be having far more interferences in your life than I have had, especially at a time when you need help, not stress, and my hope for you is that they will start realizing what this is doing to their father and to you, and start to back off and act like family. On a lighter note, I spent the last several days traveling my beautiful state of Oregon participating in 4 different Memory Walks to promote Alzheimer's awareness and to raise funds for research and care. This year I wore a picture of my mom on the back of my shirt, as hundreds of others did of their loved ones lost to AD, and we shared memories, hopes, and then dreams that this disease will gain more and more awareness and subsequent research will give us reason to believe that there will be a way to stop this disease. My little traveling daughter (all 22 years old and grown up) posted incredible pictures of herself and her traveling companions on their website, and it was reassuring to see her looking so incredibly healthy. It lessened my worries tremendously! It would have been nice had the photos been of them with all with both feet planted on the beach sand instead of hanging from precipices in their climbing gear and smiles, or solodiving off tall cliffs!! One photo, however, was of all of them dressed in their new favorite fashion statement, the one size fits all wrap Thai pants, eating fresh shrimp, smiling, and sitting outside their small tin roofed hut on the beach that has been home for 2 weeks. Take care, my friends Linda


 Hi Lyn, Mary, Linda and fellow carers. It's as if an unseen hand is guiding me in caregiving for Jean. When I read of all the stress and turmoil caregivers are going through it seems so unfair that I should be so happy. There are a number of things which could bother me, but I sideline them and focus in on my most treasured gift, Jean. The power of love is the fuel of my daily efforts, and with the passage of time that fuel overflows. As I reflect on my earlier life, there's a hint that this was what I was being molded undertake. Linda, no offence taken, you were offering well intentional advice. I've alter some of her clothing on the sewing machine. Remember I'm still good with at sewing, having started as a ten year old making shirts and repairing clothing. We were out shopping this morning and I found she was heavy to lift into the car. A negative though flashed into my mind, is it me, or is she getting too heavy to lift? I tell myself, I'm just a little tired today, be thankful for another day. It's lovley to have our daughter back from Spain and our grandson is out of Afghanistan for good. There's also the wonderful news his wife (who's also in the forces) is moving to the local military base with her 5yr old. Her husband is also expecting to join them some months later. Lyn, You have two becons of light in your life, your Dad and Cait, relax and bathe in that warm light. Banish others to the outer ark of the light glow. Your girl reflects the good example you have set her, you now reap the rich reward of watching her grow. You proved you can do it, you can do right for your Dad! Mary, It's good to learn that your slowly getting to grips with things. I was just repeating to our daughter today, why can't folk see the fruit in the orchard of life. Some pick it when it's ripe, whilst others pick it too late leaving a bitter taste. Some are so unfortunate they see nothing, those you can only feel sorry for. That's my Irish way of saying: ""What comes around, goes around"". My best wishes and prayers are with you. May your God go with you. Padraig


 I am doing just that G Padraig believe me She adores her job so much she might just change from being a vet to a Doc or Nurse ..... I am so sorry for all that everyone is going thru ........... Know my thoughts and prayers are with you's all ...... I will write more tomorrow as I had to work for the day Butterfly Kisses to G Jean and you G Padraig ........... God Bless and Love LYN


 Linda Yes I am stressed but I will get thru it with all my family here and my daughter Cait ..I know I will ...... Thanks as always for being her for me and all others YOU are my angel LUVS LYN


 Rosie.....SIS There are no words to express my luv for you ....... Thanks for being the sis you are and for all the great tea...........


 Hi, Lyn, Mary, Linda and all you wonderful people. I'm overwhelmed by you kind words and best wishes for our anniversary. How I got through yesterday, weak with flu I'll never know, but we managed to go shopping. Doubts crept into my mind as to whether I would be abe to lift Jean into and out of the car. I just switched off and managed OK, then after fixing lunch she had a nap and so did I. I'm feeling a little better today, just as well having washed her, while dressing her on the bed, she threw up the water she'd drank and some juice from the evening meal, all over the bed. Like a man in a woman's world I thought of the many times Jean had been through the same routine. Loads more washing now hanging on the line, I just have to laugh, is someone trying to tell me somthing? I phoned around to seek advice as to whether I should give her breakfast, no one knew who we were! So what's new I tell myself. That's what comes of coping alone, the story of my life. It's not something I would advise anyone to take on. The way things have worked out I was destined to be rewarded with caring for the love of my life in the winter of our years. As a lone stray I was molded in every way to protect my family from any hurt, by showing that their Mom, G' ma and great G'ma is given the best possible loving care by me, her other half. It's wonderful to have found Healingwell and hopefully anything new I learn during this 'End Stage' or is the 'Final Stage' I can pass on. There have been times like you say Lyn, I didn't think we'd make it this far. Rosie, There's a tale I'd like to relate to you, some how I think you'd find it interesting. I'd call it A' knock on the head', too long to relate here. Once again, thank you all so very much and may your God go with you. Padraig


 Well Padraig, What a time you are having!! It IS so very difficult when, as the care person, you don't feel well. Things that seemed quite manageable days before suddenly feel overwhelming and you question your ability to do all that is required. I am sorry you found yourself in that predicament. I know how challenging that can be. Like you, as the sole caregiver for both parents I feared getting sick because there was no back up plan. I did have to have surgery on my shoulder that incapacitated me almost completely for 3 days but the painkillers got me through it, along with the sheer determination that I had no choice. The 4 weeks of recovery recommended by the surgeon was laughable. As you said, and I know it is not as a complaint but rather just a fact, it is not the best course of treatment to be the sole caregiver. Sometimes there don't seem to be any other options so we just do it. The smile and kiss mom would give me after getting her in bed for the night was like an amnesia drug, forgetting the difficulties of the day and instead remembering all the moments that weren't difficult, or at least not AS difficult. Because I had not expected help and came to my parents with no expectations of help I just reminded myself that I would be the daughter with the wonderful memories of their last years, the daughter who felt so loved while showering and cooking and cleaning up for them. I am also at peace, totally, with the way in which both mom and dad were allowed to die in their own home and had I not been willing to move in with them that would not have been possible. As the disease progressed and mom drifted farther away with few current memories, she was still a lovely woman who would look at herself in the mirror after I curled her hair and remark that ""that woman looks rather old, but nice, like my own mother."" And dad, although more than a bit of a grouch, softened a great deal as the load of doing all the caregiving, housework, cooking etc. was lifted from him. I remember him saying soon after me moving in that with me there he could finally sit and read or watch the television like ""old 90 year old retired men are allowed to do."" One other note, in response to you wondering if you should feed Jean again after the vomiting in the morning and not having anyone to give you advice, I will offer a tip should this happen again: As with babies and young children, after vomiting one should wait several hours and then start allowing small sips of liquid, and if that stays down, increase gradually. After you see that liquids are being tolerated, begin with the BRAT diet which is Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast. This never failed for me as a parent and when mom would have stomach upsets, which seemed more and more frequent, it worked with her. I sincerely hope you are feeling better, that Jean is okay after the morning's upset, and that tomorrow brings an easier day. Linda


 Hi Lyn, Mary, Linda and all you lovley people. I'm feeling a lot better today, still have the cold, but have been out running twice, must keep fit. Jean is fine Linda, yes I did think of a baby when she was sick, waited an hour then gave her her breakfast. As I was feeling very weak with flu, I thought it best to check up with the nurses department who used to help with Jean four years ago. It was the start of a Monty Python sketch. No one in the department knew of us. It was suggested I get in touch with Carer's Support. They in turn would send someone to sit with Jean (for a price), while I made my way to the Doctor's Surgery. Of course I never bothered, if I was that ill how was I to drive to see the Doctor. If I had a broken leg, that's different I guess. So I phoned the National Health Service Direct for advice about Jean's sickness. After suppling all our details and about Jean's condition (she's stiff, can't move or speak) I'm asked how she looks etc. Then I'm told to ask her if she has any pains in her tummy! Now I'm put on to the expert who asks: ""Have you seen her GP"" Answer: ""The last Doctor we saw was at A&E in early Feb this year"" Next: ""How about her Community Nurse?"" Me lauging: ""What's one of those?"" He is lauging by now because he finds it hard to believe I've managed on my own for years. He promised to get back to me to let me know he'd arranged for someone to see we received a flu shot and to check up on us once in a while (to see we're still alive?). He did get back to confirm his promise, I'm not holding my breath. Then I find he's on a computer and has discoved the book I wrote! I may as well have checked Healingwell about flu and Jean being sick! Lyn, you're going through bad times again, am hoping you have good back up support. You still have to expect the unexpected in this game. The only problem is when you think things can't get any worse, they do, when you think you've reached the bottom, you haven't, so always look at the bright side of life and laugh. That's my motto. Lyn laugh with me, you can! May your God go with you. Padraig


 Hi Lyn, Mary Linda and fellow carers. There was a time I felt Jean and I were abandoned by family members. Except for our daughter who I rely on for visits and a chat twice a week. Then our son started to visit from time to time. There's grandchildren, mostly in they're mid to late twenties, visit on their birthdays and Christmas. As they total 9 in all, you can see it's going to be a busy time for me over the next few months. Four of their birthdays fall this month! On reflection I can understand why no one makes the offer of help, not that I want any. Having grown up alone I've always had to be self sufficient, which results in our family believing I'm capable of mastering anything. It was our daughter who pointed out to me why people wanted to see me beat at sport in my younger days. Little did they understand I was trying to achive self worth. Fiercely competitive in every thing I've done in life has failed to quench the fulfilment of self worth. That is until now, at last I've found my place. I always have dream and a plan to attain the goal. I may not always make it, but while trying along the way, I'm living not dying. The most important part of my caring for Jean, are for her emotions as they are the last to die. She can feel pain, sadness, happiness, a loving touch. Starved of these, stress, depression, aggression and the loss of will to live set in. She's been there. I find it strange to see how much loving care, expence and devotion is given to dumb animals, when the same is denied to fellow humans with AD. The daily questions I live with: ""What must be going on in her mind, how would I feel in her place with a short term memory, does she feel lonley?"" Answer, treat her as I would wish to be treated, then we're both content. Lyn, I hope your feeling better, take it easy let the siblings have an insight to your world. It could be a blessing in disguise for you. Mary I'm hoping you've entered calmer waters by now, take care you're all in my prayers. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Oh Lynn . . . I'm so sorry you've added seizures to your list of woes. *sigh* But, I guess if it was from a fever, it won't be chronic at least. Any results from the x-ray? So glad you are resting!!! Hang in there sis . . . rest, rest, rest!!! Blessings!"

A Time to reflect,"Hi Lyn, I'm sorry to have been away for so long, but I hope you can understand that it is coming up to a year since Jean passed on. You may be aware that I'm writing the sequel to 'Lonesome Stray' and I'm finding it such hard work. There are times I wish I had been given an education, that way I could get my story down quicker and with less effort. I have a burning passion to let people read my story as I'm sure a lot can benefit from it. It can not be just a story about Alzheimer's alone because without the evidence of what I did alone 24/7 365 days for almost five years would be considered impossible. To-date I'm half way through my story and strange as it may seem I'm looking forward to covering the Alzheimer's road part. I look in on your site from time to time and note caregivers keep repeating the same questions and make the same statments. Like 'every patient is different'. My answer to that is, every single person is different. In my case I know the chances of coming accross someone like me would be very unlikely. It's because of who I am that I was able to enyoy caring for the girl that was the first person to introduce me to the meaning of love. My life was enriched in so many ways by being granted the wonderful privilege of caring for the special girl that took on this abandoned stray 55years earlier and married me 3yrs later. What would I have done extra? Though I'd known her since she was 17, while she could still speak I would have tried harder to learn more about her life as a child. I'll never know how hard it must be for a daughter, son, grand daughter etc, to realy know who their loved one is/was. At 77yrs old I know that if anyone tried to 'put me away' I sure as hell would fight for my life. But then I would, because I was 'put away' by a judge for 14 yrs as a two year old. The pain of seeing Alzheimer's patients in a NH still haunts me. One clear picture is of a lady with her hair falling out, no teeth, her face brused and battered. When I looked into her eyes the wear of years fell away and there was still the lovley young girl. Without thinking I did something I could never do, I put my arms about her in an embrace and cried. All through my years of incarceration I had never experienced an embrace and until meeting Jean. By the way I'm still out running every morning. I may be on my own, but I value the control of my life. We tend to forget that growing old brings changes, it's the same road for Alzheimer's victims only their road is full of pot holes and boulders. Some people state: 'Why me?' I say: 'Why not me?' We can't pick the way we go. Some say: 'He/she always cries when I visit' I become overwhelmed with emotion when people are kind to me. They are tears of joy. Savour the NOW, what will be will be. Hope this is not too long a post. May your God go with you. Padraig","Dear Charlie Rice 1931: I wish you all the best in getting your story down with pen to paper. I too, have the task of being sole caregiver 24/7/365, but for my Dad. It is not an easy road. The repetition of days, months, stories, sentences, memories, directions, explanations, and being so important to anyone as their very existance rests with you. If only for a day, having ""me time"" is so precious. Occasionally, I get a few hours and I find myself literally running to get errands and tasks done in order that the person who is the center of my obsession, waits. I crave my freedom but feel quite free as long as I choose this path. There isn't a logical option, other than continuing, as I am, as long as I can because my Dad would perish if he wasn't free to go outside, even if only for a minute to check the temperature.


 Tyno I am going to bring up the threads of G Padraigs or Charlie Rice........ I hope you read the journey we all took and what we went thru So much of what He said helped me in so many different ways and does to this day God Bless LYN


 Charlie....G Padraig It is a PROVEN fact that baby boomers ( especially women) will develop AD or some type of demetia And yes thru the ways you have posted I am so happy to see you here posting your wisdom as you always did God Bless Butterfly Kisses LYN


 My dearest Grampa Padraig Never could you write too long a post ........ I savor your every word 'I was just thinking about you and G Jean the other day and that it is almost a year since she has been gone WE had a journey together you and I and Many other kindred spirits on here A Journey I will never forget I mourned for G Jean and not even having met her I knew her thru your eyes and words daily I honestly felt as though my own Grama had passed I constantly think of you and you words of wisdom your fights for her and her proper treatment The sweet LOVE you shared Sometimes to this day I draw on you and your strength I have re read many times the Thread of you and GJean and what you did and went thru with her Out of a love so deep Your story has toched many hearts here but none a much as mine Maybe I am being selfish to say that but I cannot help it I feel it so ........ Losing both Mom n Dad has had me look at my own mortality and I sunk deep into depression Now I am doing much better as I CELEBRATE each of their lives and what they gave each of us kids Not the material things but the honest love and caring Teaching and parenting I would love to read this book ......... Please know I am with you in Spirit always Butterfly Kisses God Bless LYN


 Hi tyno3, You'll never know how your post affected me. The last time I was address as Charlie Rice was 1947. It was a jolt to see it in print by someone else. You see as a child up to the age of 16 that is how I was addressed. I had been incarerated in Industrial Schools for all what most people call childhood. For most of the rest of my life the shame and stigma attached to those places forced my to deny that period ever existed. Only in recent years through the internet have the public become aware of the horrific abuses commited on children in these places. In 2006 I learned for the first time through the Irish Freedom of Information Act that I had not been in State custody from birth, but had been charged in court as a two year with begging and sentenced to be detained till aged 16. Why I was abandoned by what ever family I'd came from during those years I'll never know. A strange woman did come to pick me up when I was due for 'final disposal' it was my birth woman who insisted my name was not Charlie, I did however know my number that at least I can remember 11,536. I soon ran away from her and kept on running, learning about the strange world I'd entered. Imagine, I never knew there was a difference between boys and girls! The best thing to happen to me was meeting a poor 17yr old factory girl who agreeded to take me to her heart, and like a faithful stray I loved her more than I loved my self. We were married three years later and it lasted just over 52 years. When I chose to care for my wife alone and refuse any help, I stopped all the medication they were giving her in the HN the experts said she was dying, and so she was, but it was due to ignorance on how best to care for my wife. One night I asked a doctor to visit because she was drifting in and out of consciousness, he advised me not to hold her hand overnight as she would pass away when I visited the bathroom or made a drink. Four and a half years later she passed away 12/12/07! The experts referred to me as 'a one off' it's not a tag I like but I'm stuck with it. I miss nurishing, cherishing and loving her as my own very special baby she'd become. During those years I snatched time to write and have published the first part of my story: 'Lonesome Stray'. Now I'm plodding through the sequel and even though I have not gotten to the part dealing with Alzheimer's I've finished about halfway and it's as much as the first book. My background and my very special lady inspired me to achive things most people dream of. In spite of a lack of education (I worked from 10 year old) I provided her with the promised dream home and retired age 54. It was a real blessing to love and cherish the girl that gave purpose to my live. I'll never know the pain of losing a Mum or Dad and now it hurts, not knowing how our son and daughter's pain. I've told our daughter ""Your Mum has not gone, you are of her, she gave you life, blood, food and warmth for nine months, then brought you forth to the world. When you look in the mirror you will see her like I do."" I have photos of me taking Jean shopping just weeks before she passed away. I thank you tyno3 for showing me that there is the wonder of love for your Dad in your life, there is not enough love about . God bless and may your God go with you. Padraig


 Hi, Lyn and caregivers. When a spouse has cared for their mate they become acutely aware of the fears they both experience. Right up to the 1970s young members of families in many areas may recall older relations being put away because they started acting strangely. These early victims of AD were only spoken of in whispers because of the stigma attached to the illness. They were put away the same as unwanted children were put in orphanages located way out from towns: out of sight out of mind. We have finished with orphanages, but many NH are still located way out in the sticks, adding to the stress of visiting. To-day, those who confront the illness head on do so because they love enough to become a caregiver. Still many relatives can not face the facts, for whatever reasons they adopt the attitude 'out of sight out of mind'. It's not the fear that they might 'catch it' rather it may be the fear of not knowing if they did 'catch it', would they be properly cared for? It scares the living daylights out of me to think that I may end up like my wife after the experiences we were put through. I'm so scared that I keep running six miles each morning in the hope of it failing to catch me! As an outsider I believe that the numbers of people to become victims will vastly increase in the next few years, not just because folk are living longer but through changes in lifestyle. Time is running out to find a cure, in the meanwhile we should be learning better and more inaginative ways of dispensing tender loving care. As someone who was trained as a child I came to hate that term, you train animals, you teach people. I was so well trained I could stand, sit, speak, eat etc., to the blast of a whistle. I never learned much, but it still upsets me when I reflect on how NH staff are 'trained' they completed their daily tasks in relation to my wife as they completed their training. Learning is an ongoing process, lifelong. Once I joined my wife in her world I found it extremely interesting and very edifying. May each of your caregiving journeys be more rewarding than torturous. May your God go with you. Padraig"
Mother's illness is progressing...,"Hello Everyone, My mother began having symtoms of dementia or alzheimer's about six years ago and during this time it has progressed. She sleeps most of the time now and only gets up to sit at the table for a while. I try to get her out once a week, but it's harder getting her ready as she is very slow. Also, she takes baby steps and going in and out of someplace takes a lot of time. If we take her to Walmart, we use one of their wheel chairs and push her around. She weighs around 88 lbs. Her normal weight is around 110. My brother is disabled and lives with her and takes such good care of her. Mom is 85 and my brother is 60. He does not drive because of an eye disease, so he takes a bus everywhere, shopping, etc. or I take him. One day my brother came home from the store and mother asked him who he was, but most of the time she knows who he is and she knows who I am. I think that is because we are with her more than anyone else. She remembers her childhood and things that happened back then and can remember some other things also. Her short term memory is very bad. If I tell her we are going to see my sister, she will ask me about four more times over a period of ten minutes where we are going again. Do the things I have written sound more like dementia or alzheimers? We are not sure what she has. She takes a pill daily her doctor gave her which is supposed to help her memory and I believe it has somewhat. Does anyone know any vitamins that might help her? The other day my brother put down something on the table for her to eat and she asked what it was? She didn't know it was food? I don't think this has happened before. about a year or so before this happened to my mother, she was very ill and we noticed that she was losing weight and was very nervous and just not herself at all. We couldn't get her to go to the doctor and when we finally did, after some tests, the doctor told us that she had an overactive thyroid. She had to take a radio-active pill which was made for her by a radiation oncologist for her size and this knocked her thyroid out and then the doctor gave her pills to build it back up. Her thyroid is normal now, but I have often wondered if this could have had anything to do with the dementia or alzheimer's coming on mother. She has two sisters who are 86 and 77 and they are fine. Her mother passed away at 96 and she was fine. There is no family history of anything like this in her family. Would appreciate any input. Also, I have heard there are different stages of alzheimers and I wonder what stage mother would be in. Would appreciate any response. Thank you, Wiggyann Post Edited (wiggyann) : 12/2/2008 1:19:53 AM (GMT-7)","Hello Marie, My mother was not much of an outdoor person because she worked all of her life and ran a home besides. She only had a pet once for several years after my dad passed away. Her illness began around six years ago and yes, she has had the flu and also gets flu shots every year. We first noticed that something was wrong when she was about 79, and was driving home from one of her sisters. She somehow ended up in a town over half an hour away. We received a call from the police telling us that mother was lost and they had her at the police station there. This was after one a.m. in the morning and my brother-in-law went and picked her up. Evidently, she was confused and drove past her apartment building and somehow ended up on a highway. After that, my brother who is legally blind and lives with her noticed that when she cooked, she would put ingredients in that didn't belong and leave some out that did and she had never done anything like this before. So, we knew that something was wrong and over the years her illness has progressed. Once last year, she told my brother that she wanted to take the trash out and was determined to do so. My brother watched her from the window and when she got outside on the walk, she looked around and he could tell she didn't know where to go so he went out and got her. She stays in the house and never goes out of the apartment unless I take her or my two aunts will take her somewhere. But she sleeps a lot now. When her sisters come over they sit and talk, but mother never says anything. She just sits there and appears to listen. I know she understands everything I say. She may ask me to repeat something several times, but she knows what I 'm saying. She doesn't know a lot of our family the ones that she only sees on the holidays. When we are driving she will start singing songs that were popular when she was growing and first married. And I always sing along with her. I am not familiar with Lyme Disease. But it sounds serious. I hope your treatment goes well and you fully recover. Thank you for posting, Wiggyann


 Thanks Sherry for your post Mother takes aricept and it seems like it has helped her. Bless your heart for caring for your grandmother for four years. It is extremely difficult to care for someone like that. Mother sleeps most of the time or sits at the table and watches television. My brother keeps the channel on with all of the old reruns such as I love Lucy and the Andy Griffith Show, and mom likes to watch those. I do too. There are a lot better than most of what's on television now. He got her ready to go Walmart one day when I was picking them up and then he went to do something and mother put her old clothes back on. My brother has his own bedroom with his bed and a recliner and television in it and mother is in the living room on the couch watching television in there in the evenings, he comes out to check on her sometimes, but that way, he sort of has a little place of his own to relax in. My grandmother was in a nursing home for six years before she passed away at almost 96. My aunt was keeping her and then she broke her hip and that is when they put her in the nusing home. But mom, and both of my aunts were there every day for six years to visit her. If they missed a day or went somewhere they had me to go out and stay with her in the evening for a few hours. My grandmother had something, but I don't think it was alzheimer's. She would tell her daughters when they came that she had been to the store all morning shopping and things like that. But most of the time she was herself. Wiggyann


 It does sound like she definitely has a dementia 'Now the thing is to find out how far she is gone and what the demetia is 'There are many types of AD I have a few threads on all the ones that are more common Like Lewy Body Vascular demitia......ect read thru the threads I will bump them up for you Short temr memory is very common with any dementia as is slower actions on their part I also looked after first Mom and then dad til both passed It is a very hard but rewrading and unselfish thing you are doing for her Most dementia and AD ppl revert back to childlike lives THAT is the most difficult I went thru with both parents Aricept is a GOOD med for most ppl with this dang disease and I am glad she is doing a bit better on it I know I wish everyday that 'This was not the cause of us losing our loved ones our seniours WE need plenty more research and and continued help in the fight against this DD You and your brother are to be really acknowledged for doign what you's are doign for your Mom ** If you need to talk email me or add me to msn ........... Alheimers society has alot of info for you as well Alzinfo.Org is a great site as well to go to ......... Please know you's are not alone God Bless you and your brother as well as your sweet Mom LYN


 NO problem hun I mean I will bring the threads to front as I already did read thru them and see what you think........... God Bless LYN


 Good Morning Ann, This is Kitt and I just want you to know my heart goes out to you. I read the posts in this forum and I pray for each of you and admire you for finding the strength to carrry on daily. My Grandmother-in-law had this disease and to watch her change and see how it afected my MIL was so sad. To have your own parent get to the point where they do not know you is heart breaking but they are still inside the body somewhere so we always visited her and took her Christmas present. She loved the big read bow. She would look at my husband, her first born grandson and say "" And just who are you?"" I know how heartbroken he felt as all his childhood he only lived a couple of blocks from Grandma and was there frequently. Bless each of you. Kitt


 Hello Kitt, I'm sorry about your husband's grandmother. It is especially hard for someone not to recognize you if have always been close to them. My mother has two sisters, one who is a year older and another who is six years younger and they do not have any sign of dementia or alzheimer's. I keep looking for a heriditary link, but then something like this can stike anyone. Wiggyann


 Sherry, I am going to do that. Thank you very much wiggyann


 Did your mother spend time outdoors? did she garden? did she have a pet that went in and out of the house? what state do you live it how quickly did all of these things start with her? when was the last time that she was well? and do you remember her getting a flu? marie


 I'm not too familiar with the differences of dementia or Az but I just wanted to say that I know it's just horrible to see someone you love decline to any mental illness. Personally to me it sounds like she has Az though - but like I said, I don't know much about the differences. What medication did the doctor put her on? My gma will do that in social situations too. Just sit and listen. The only time she will say something is if there is a lull in conversation. And sometimes what she says makes no sense at all but at least she is trying to communicate. My gma has either Az or dementia too and is currently living in an assisted living center after living with me for 4 years. I was unable to care for her anymore and I felt she was safer in the center. *Very rough choice for me which still bothers me btw*. But basically what her doctor told me is that I have to stop thinking of her as an adult now. Sure, treat her as such but her whole mental status is that of a child now. A wayward child maybe! :) I applaud your brothers efforts taking care of your mother. That in itself speaks volumes. And you sound like an awesome daughter as well just by the fact that you are here trying to find advice about your mother.


 LOL I used to have all the old shows on for Gma too when she lived with me. I can personally tell you almost every single storyline of Gunsmoke! :) My Gma loves the westerns and I love Lucy. After watching these shows all day for 4 years you can bet that they don't go anywhere near my TV screen now. :)


 Dear Lyn, I enjoyed reading your post and learned a lot also. I don't know what you meant by ""bump them up for me"" but would like to read the information you have about this illness. I think it is amazing that you cared for both of your parents (at different times) through something like this. You must have gone through a lot. I was over at my mother and brother's tonight for awhile and mother got up. She had been dozing on the couch and she sat at the table with me. I talked and she listened. She doesn't say much. I try to always go over to her and hug her around the shoulders and kiss her on the forehead and cheek a couple of times while she's sitting at the table with me because I love her, but I know how important and healing affection is for everyone. Short term memory is something that mom has. If I go over to take her somewhere, she will always say, ""We will go in a minute,"" and seems to want to sit at the table for awhile. Then, she will ask me several more times what we are going to do while we are sitting there. Also, she moves very slowly any more, as i mentioned before she takes baby steps and it takes so long for us to get from the car up to the door of someone's house or from the car into a store. So, we don't go to walmart anymore unless we go to one that has a wheelchair I can put her in. And if we go somewhere , she is tired after a couple of hours and ready to go back home. Plus, she gets chilled very easily. In the winter, my brother has to keep the thermostat in the apartment very warm and I know he is miserable, but mother gets cold. It may be because she only weighs around 90 lbs. Her normal weight was about 110. Once when I was there, my aunt (her sister) had to have a test ran at the hospital and and I was talking about it. And the next day I was there and mom said, "" Wasn't someting wrong with somebody? She remembered what I had told her. She doesn't pay any attention to her hair anymore unless we are going somewhere. Then, she will put on a little powder, some lipstick and eyebrow pencil. So, I don't know what stage she would be in I take her a couple of times a year to get it cut and a curly perm so it looks nice, but right now it has grown out a lot. my brother wants to wait until the middle of the month to get her another perm so it will look nice for Christmas Eve when our family all gets together. Thanks for everything, Lyn Wiggyann


 My Gma is a slow walker too. So what I do, and this is mainly to keep her walking and active, is to let her hang onto the cart and I steer the cart. So when you take your mom out and if she is able to walk ok, have you tried getting a cart out of the parking lot and have her hang on? I don't go super fast or anything like that because I don't want Gma to stumble but I do go fast enough that we aren't at a snail pace :) Also, does your mom have a handicap permit? My gma has one because of her blindness so it puts us closer to the entrance which makes a ton easier on me as well.


 Hi Red_34, Yes, I have let her hang onto the cart or push it, but I have to help guide and push too. This was several years back, now it is better for my brother or I to put her in a in a wheelchair if there is one available. Can I get a handicap permit since she no longer drives? Mother had to stop driving some years back. I had never thought of that. Thanks for posting, wiggyann


 Each state has their own regulation as to what qualifies as a handicap. Check with your state and see if anything your mother has can qualify. Does your brother have a handicap plaque because of his eyes? If not, then he can get one and you can use it if he is with you and your mother."
"Despondent, won't eat, won't get out of bed.","i would appreciate some feedback on wht is going on with my Dad. about a week ago, his feet started hurting him. he and I went to doc and doc said ""special insoles""so I got them. he was walking around for a couple of days, somewhat better than previously. Then his stomach started hurting him. He would wake up in the middle of the night, haave to bolt to toilet, then would lie curled up in pain. I was able to treat symptoms with OTC immodium, rolaids and occasionally, when he was really in bad shape I'd give him 1/2 of a sedative. He is prescribed 1/2 in AM and 1 at night. I keep an emergency ""stomach remedy"" by his bed. It has just those things I mentioned. Primarily though he seems to be withdrawing into his own little world. He won't eat the food I prepare, all he wants is a glass of milk and a piece of toast with p'nut butter. He eats this twice a day. Very rarely also ice cream. Is this part of the disease? Withdrawl into his own world, refusal to eat proper food? What can I do? I arrange activities for us but he refuses to participate. Woodworking, puzzles, decorating tree, etc.","Yes Red is spot on The ones with this DD do sometimes withdraw and will stop eating,drinking and just stay in bed He is getting some good out of the PB taost and milk 'But I would try to make sure he dioes get some water Also If possible the doc can order Ensure drinks for him and if he likes milk maybe he would like ensure Milkshakes' I gained alot of weight on them and felt good Mom was also on them drank 3 a day......... Last one at night I made her a milkshake........ Plz Keep us posted Tyno.....Luvs LYN


 My gma would eat a piece of toast and tell me that she had dinner. So I am pretty sure that these eating dilemas are fairly common. But it seems to me that if his stomach is really hurting him then he should be seen by a doctor if you haven't already done so. He can have a hiatal hernia or any other ailment. Is he getting depressed?"
"Thank-you, Time takes it's toll","Unfortunately, my Dad has been transmogrified by this disease, into an angry, cranky, unmanageable person whom I don't even recognize. I saw him in hospital yesterday, actually twice. I popped in on my way to get his wife (in a nursing home), to bring her to see him. I think he was mildly sedated as he said "" Ï suppose she would come anyway even if I told her, no."" This was an odd remark, I just said ""yes, probably"" and told him it would be 1.5 hours to get her, and left. She was no sooner there, now this is a big lady who cannot stand on her own, so it's no picnic trying to transport her, but with my son's help, I was able to get her there. She wasn't in his room five minutes when she looked at me and said ""well, I guess we should be going now"". I was floored. Anyway, Dad got up and put his hat on as she told him, ""no, you're not going, I'm going back to my nursing home, you stay here."" Then he looked at his watch, and looked at me and said "" you have exactly one hour to get her wherever she has to go, and get back here"". ""Sure says I,"" wheeling her out. Earlier in the day, I'd recieved a call from the placement agency, saying "" we might have a placement for him"". There is a place called ""The Odd Fellows Lodge"". I nearly broke out laughing as my Dad always was an ""oddfellow"". Sleeps on top of his covers, fully dressed, including work boots and all. They have to do a risk assessment due to his having been admitted through emergency, as he had been combative. Then, after we spent half our gas allowance for the month driving the 200 miles to get one spouse to see the other, my stepmom announces ""I should have married Gus, he was in the Navy, and he wanted to marry me, my life would have been much better. My son who loves his Grampa dearly nearly drove off into the ditch. I could see him gritting his teeth. On the way home he said ït was all I could do not to tell her what he thought of that remark, she would have had a better life if she hadn't married his Grampie. She managed to run through half a million in real estate, of my Dad's, dropping it into the slots. I don't think ""Gus"" would've had that kind of money to throw away. So, on it goes. We wait. Then we transport to wherever they can find a bed for him, this man with the hooded eyes who has taken over my father's body. The worst thing is, I never had a chance to take him on a little trip to a closeby Island as he always took us, as children. I wanted to do that before he disappeared. There was just to much else going on. Stepping from crisis to crisis, robbing peter to pay paul, and all. If you are where I was two years back, and your parent with Alzheimers, has some lucidity left, please take him on a little trip for me.","Thanks Lyn: It got to the point, my Dad was so abusive and angry, I brought my son up to give me a couple of free days, to rest and recreate myself. Within 24 hours, my Dad had my son cornered in the kitchen. This was after the night my son sat outside my bedroom all night so I could sleep. My Dad was wandering all night, opening and closng bedroom doors. He scared the daylights out of me. Then later, that same day I had to step between them, Dad and Son, b/c I knew my son would never strike his Grampie but I had no idea what my Dad was capable of. He does blame me for a lot of things he lost, truck, driver's license, farm, tractor, wife, etc., etc., Probably b/c I was the main person in his life through-out. He is no longer home, he is in hospital waiting for a LTC bed. He could be hard to place due to aggression. It is awful waiting. I go see him about once a week, but it creates such an uproar, Dad wanting to come home, me saying no, they're still trying to figure out what's wrong. Since his feet are so bad, we can always blame his feet for being in hospital. It is the most ambivalent feeling, sad, but glad not to have to walk around on eggshells.


 And again, Thank-you, for all the encouragement. I saw my Dad tonight. He seems much more at peace, than I've ever seen him. It's almost as if he can stop holding his breath and relax. He's in the hands of competent people, he now knows it, he doesn't seem to need to fight for his territory, anymore, nor does he have to pretend he's got everything under control. He has the time and peace to come to terms with the reality of what is happening to him. Time and spac e to grieve, as do I. Although it is pure he-- jumping through those last half dozen hoops. He is high on the Dept. of Health's priority list due to Adult Protection's involvement. He has a ward with one doctor, three nurses, only 1 other person (2 patients), and about fifty channels on his TV. They are seeking a place for him dilligently. If I wasn't so gall darn tired and in pain due to this freezing temperatures, I'd become more active in the selection process. There was this one very special mounty that came all the way, following the ambulance, off duty, but came b/c he'd responded to a Domestic Disturbance complaint one night about 5 weeks back, this one special mountie, who knew the situation very well, heard the call over the scanner and came to back me up and explain how incredibly impossible a situation it really was. That's an angle of mercy. He had stressed to me on the earlier call, that ""things are going to get worse"", you won't be able too keep up once he starts wandering at night. How right he was. The Fibromyalgia gets extremely bad when my sleep is interrupted, (not to mention the continuous cold). I hurt all over, like crazy. Now there is so much to do, my stepmother, Dad's wife, gets jealous and ticked off when she feels he's getting too much attention and starts to up the ante. She now has appointments she has to be lugged around to. Anyway, duty calls, I'll have to get up real early to get her and go on to Appt. in city, I do have a week or so to adjust to the idea. Yup, I did what I could. No more, no less.


 tyno3, Just read the post about your dad and your adventure driving to pick up his wife in the nursing home. It's incredible the things that come out of peoples' mouths sometimes. I'm very sorry your son was hurt by her remark which was quite cruel. I wonder if she even thought about the effect her words might have on someone else present. Don't be too hard on yourself for not getting to take your dad on the little trip to the closeby island that he took you to as children. You are there for him and you love him and that's the most important thing. Wiggyann


 My heart breaks for you hun I am so bloody sorry that you have to go thru this Things cant get any worse .............so they say but with this DD anything is likey KNOW we are all here for you and your Dad.........

Your friend LYN


 Thank-you for your kind words, wiggyann. I never understood what my Dad saw in that woman to begin with. She is his second wife, he left my mother for her. Although my mother was no walk in the park either. Before he became so befuddled, a couple of years bback as he was finally waking up to the debt he incurred in his name, I teased him saying Dad, I did that getting married thing, once, it lasted five years, I never could nail the fellow down to get Divorce papers signed so I guess we're still legally married. That's OK because we have two children together and neither of us was interested in re-marrying. We're (in law only) coming up on our 23rd wedding aniversity this coming August. Anyway, this is the second time she made such a remark, although the first time only I heard it, she said ""he's not good for anything, anymore, I didn't respond, pretended I didn't hear her. She has a gambling addiction and that's all she's interested in, getting to the Casino. She says, once the weather warms up, I'm going to take her ""just for a couple of hours. This is a woman with acute kidney failure, diabetes, and cannot walk. Shall I take her in a wheelbarrow? Oter than that i just feel mildly depressed about Dad being in hospital, waiting to get a bed somewhere. I feel so bad. I'm also a tad nervous visiting him cause when he sees me, he thinks we're going home. He gets his hat and coat. I have to explain, we need to find a better place to live, and I will come take him there when we find it. Then I have to go saaying I have an appointment."
Partner Has Alzheimer's......I Need Help Please,ok ok okkkkkkkkkk........i need help.......if you knew me you would know how big this is........so please help me........my partner has alzheimers..i've dealt for years but i need help Added a title to your thread so ppl will answer it more if they know what it is about ......... LYN Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 12/15/2008 4:51:44 PM (GMT-7),"hi and thanks for the welcome.....i'm dealing with things a little better today, i just have moments where i feel lost....... my partner was diagnosed with ad when she was 41....before that we went through 5 years of pure hades.....there were alot of things going through my mind at first, from maybe she's doing drugs to maybe it's a breakdown..... she lost her job because she would get angry and aggressive if she was questioned or told she did something wrong.....she would sit in the car for hours....she lost interest in everything...... it took 5 years to get the answer...early onset ad.....and i detest it..... we're now 4 years on with it.....she has been on different medications and some helped.....i suppose the word progression is appropriate.... i'm fortunate to have my own business and be able to work from home...... anyway it's time to serve up some ensure and cheese crackers...... thanks for listening.....


 I am glad you reposted I know I had many a bad day as well with looking after MOM and then Dad till they passed I know Dad also went with a broken heart they were together fo more than 47 plus yrs He did al for her and once she passed he was DX with this DD I so despise what it does to them They HAVE got to be scared....NOT all memory cells are gone IMHO There is SO much info on the site here that you very well should read up on Wasvshe DX wuth AD or any typoe of dementia like Lewy'sBody........Vascular Dementia?? What meds is she currently on if you dont mind?? ............LYN


 Yes, I do believe that mumbling is pretty common. My gma would do that a lot or even talk aloud to herself or the TV. My gma just recently started Namenda and is doing fairly ok on it. I am new to learning the whole Alzheimers thingy but that does seem awfully young! I'm sorry that you and your partner are going thru this. It is NOT an easy thing to deal with.


 I too believe the ""mumbling "" is norm Both Mom and Dad did this ...... Sweetie I know it is hard for you to see and know she is slipping away My HEART n SOUL go out to you and to her of course I watched Dad go from active 170 plus lbs to a fetal poition in hospital on life support in a matter of no time It is a horrid disease killing our most valued members of society God Be With you Email me if you want to talk Red is great with input as are other members 'I have been sick sorry........... Luvs LYN


 Heaven forbid. I mumble because the verbal side is the strongest in my make-up. In order to work through a problem, I'll coach myself along, eg. ""Well if this little piece fits there, no it's too big, I need a smaller piece"". I am problem solving, coaching myself, I did that for as long as I can remember. If verbal communication breaks down, we just need to switch to writing things down. I'll sometime put a note on construction paper, and write with Sharpie, WE'll load the truck, 3:00 PM. That seems to work well in my Dad's case. I sometimes also use a tape recorder, to play back if we're discussing something important. Finally, we have to adhere to a schedule. This is helpful for dementia in general. It's a lot less worrysome if everything runs pretty much on a schedule. This lends comfort in allowing a confused person feel like they can at least predict what is coming next. I am very sorry this has developedso suddenly, at such an early age. However, if you can try to keep the victim fairly active mentally and physically, you will have a better time of it.


 I so remember you posting abot this G Padraig when G Jean said ""YES"" BTW......That is a good way to do it Coach them or teach them a sign or a nod or one word even .........IMHO God Bless ' LYN


 How are you making out Lynnie


 the nurse asked me about involving hospice in my partner's care now....does that mean she's dying.......why would she bring that up to me.....i was sort of in shock after that and didn't comprehend much else


 hi, thank you for your concern.....they say i can get home hospice for her if i talk with her dr...i'm not sure how i feel about that yet, it's still sinking in....right now, i'm just glad i have her home with me..... we've been together for 20 yrs....i'd never send her away to a hospice......i don't know what i'm going to do without her when the lord calls her home.......


 thank you so much....


 I am glad she is home with you She does know the difference of who is looking after her and with the love she gets from you LYN


 YOU have no need to feel that you are not wanted nor get an uncomfortable feeling by posting 'You have a sick partner and you need all the support you can get now and learnig things helps as well DO not stop posting plz You are an asset to the forum LYN


 Welcome to the Alzheimer's forum and HW Please do feel free to read the threads already up and they do explain AD and what to expect If you are homecare provider for your loved oone there are threads on that as well Could you plz give a few more details so we can understand just what is going on.........?? It would be a big help for me ....... Stay strong STAY with us LYN


 hi again.....i have a question for someone who's been here.....is mumbling a common behavior? my partner will mumble to herself, sometimes while i am talking to her....she will look away from me and seem to carry on a conversation with someone else, always mumbling...


 she was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers....i was surprised to find out it could attack someone so young... she is currently taking namenda and aricept....also xanax when she needs it and trazadone...she was on paxil, but seems to get on better without it....along with a blood pressure med.....


 thanks....she seems a bit better on the namenda.....the mumbling is disturbing but i will deal with it.....i've learned alot about myself through this......still no matter how tightly i hold on she seems to be drifting farther away......


 it is just getting so hard to get legible sentences from her anymore that the mumbling makes me feel like i am missing out on something important she may be saying....does that make sense? i'm sorry you haven't been well.....so thank you for taking time to answer me.......


 I solved the problem when my wife could no longer talk, (of course she was in the so called 'end stage' for about six year) by asking 50/50 questions i. e. 'yes' 'no' answers. In the final few months I tried to get the yes/no nod but it was not forth comming, I did try to explain to her: ""When I kiss you and you kiss me back, it's a yes and when you don't, it's a no."" Only a matter of weeks before she passed away I was explaining it and gently told her how very much I loved her and asked: ""Do you love me?"" For the second time in five years she gave me the best gift anyone could ask for, a very quietly whispered ""Yes"". The first time was just over two years earlier as I strapped her into her wheelchair to take her out on our 50th wedding anniversary. As I knelt to strap her legs in: ""This day 50 years ago you took this stray on, would you do it all over again and marry me."" I can picture her now as she summoned up the effort, with a strangled ""Yes"". Though two yeses I'll treasure till I die. The light has gone out of my life now, but the caring for her on my own 24/7 365 days for the final five years has given me a strength and fulfilment that keeps me going. I'm one very lucky person to have been fit above average to do the caring. I wish you all a peaceful Christmas and that your cross be a little lighter in the future. May your God go with you. Padraig


 thank you so much for your advice.......i'll pray i have half of your strength.......


 a home nurse is coming this afternoon to help make sure my partner has what she needs so i can bring her home tomorrow.....she'll be on oxygen and have some breathing therapy for awhile but she'll be home......i think they keep her too medicated at the hospital instead of dealing with her.. i may be able to get some sleep once she is home and i know she is ok.... i just need to know she is where she feels safe and secure.....thank you for asking.....


 Are you sure she said HOSPICE A Hospice is where they can keep them more comfortable and they have more nursing staff at least here in Ontario thats the case Are you able to still fully function ( even though I am sure you are drained emotionally and physically) I have NO idea why this would be brought up BUT I do know I would call your Case Workers Supervisor and get the total answer as to what they are talking about if it were I PLEASE hun know I am holding your hand SHE does not need to go away from you YOU rae what she needs IMHO Luv and God Bless LYN Email me if you care too


 OKAY hun it is help caring for her thats what it is Community care access It might help out and you can spend more time with her while they do the things you normally have to do that take up your time from her Think aboiut it No rush right keep me posted plz Luvs LYN


 my partner had to be taken back to the hospital after only being home for 2 days, she had a collapsed lung and we couldn't get a grip on the fevers.....she just came home yesterday and is doing some better.... i'm not sure about the hospice help, i am used to doing things for her myself and she gets frustrated and anxious around others....she will have a home nurse coming for a few days until they are sure she will be ok at home.....so far she so good with that.... i thank you so much for your concern and help.... lynnie


 she definately does know the difference..... before she was this bad she would get very nasty with anyone different doing anything for her.....now it's just evident with body language and i can tell she's uncomfortable around others....there is still a home nurse who visits because of the iv medications, and my partner will sort of drift off when she is working with her, sort of distancing herself i guess.... you know, i feel out of place around here a little....everyone here is dealing with a parent or grandparent and i hope i am not out of line or making anyone uncomfortable, i'm just looking for help and understanding like everyone else.... i've gotten so much information from this site for a long time now and it has all been helpful......."
"Ginkgo is ineffective, what's next?","Hi all, Recent news indicate that Ginkgo is useless against dementia. My mom has been on it for over 4 months and um.. the first week seemed to be a miracle in the making but then nothing good happened. She seems confused as ever and now even talks to herself. CoQ-10, Vitamin E, and Fish oil was always mentioned with Ginkgo as the supplements to take. Rather than buying all 3 for my mom with existing dementia, can anyone give testimonies of which is better if I were to get just one for her to take. I would love to hear some positive stories. Thanks much.","My mom has been on Namenda for over 2 years. She originally was on 20 mg but I can't remember why I had to decrease it to just 10 mg a day. I haven't seen much difference in her mental state by taking it. I think mixing vitamins with medication is ok. E, CoQ 10 and fish oil are not herbal type supplement so there shouldn't be any interactions from Namenda with them. My mom took CoQ 10 a few years back but they are very expensive. I don't know if it's worth buying it again. I don't recall if they did any good either.


 My mom has tried Aricept (gave her nightmares) and Exelon (made her shake worse from her Parkinsons) so Namenda was the only thing left. I think the reason her dose was decreased was because she seemed more confused with 20mg instead of 10mg that she's currently on. I asked her doctor if we can take her off completely since it's not doing anything for her. Her doctor seems to think if she doesn't take any dose then her Dementia will accelerate even faster. I don't think she's right. It's going to get worse no matter what since there is no cure out there. Her anxiety is getting worse. She's constantly yanking out the buttons on her clothes and look like she wants to jump out of her skin most of the time. I thought of asking for Lexapro for her but it has a problem with weight gain and my mom doesn't need that. Geez is anything simple?


 Thanks. Yes I know. I gave her Ativan and Xanax before and they both made her hyper and gave her nightmares.


 I had a nervous breakdown 8 years ago and Ativan was just what I needed to fall asleep. It did make me feel out of sorts. I ended up with Xanax and has been on it ever since. I take just half of .25 every morning to calm my nerves before I start my day but then again I'm relatively young. Maybe my mom's doctor can prescribe a sleep med for my mom. She's been getting up 3 to 4 times a night very night which means I do the same. I'm a walking zombie all the time and needless to say my anxiety is back and I'm crying a lot more to release my frustration of this never ending cycle.


 I know my limit. If I increase my current dose I'll get drowsy and then it will interfere with work. My co-workers are always amazed that I can still function with only 3-4 hours of interrupted sleep nightly. Me too!


 I believe in the medications that Neuro's RX like Nameda......... And plenty of other ones I have had no experience with any of the herbal stuff and I never gave them to Mom nor dad Mixing herbal and RX meds is not a good ides LYN I wish you all the best.......talk to your doc or her doc


 There is a chance the med has pooped out Ask your doc about another med there is aricept and others for this DD I so so depise the Alzheimers and what it does to our loved ones No those( fish oil and other things you mentioned) would not interfere in her meds hun Luvs LYN


 NO hun it just isnt with this DD and many others Maybe a AD would do her some good perhaps a mild one Ativan ( benzo) is NOT good for AD ppl at all IMHO and in research articles Can cause more aggitation and agreessiveness Let me know how you make out plz Luvs LYN


 Ativan is the worst IMHO I have or had never given Mom nor dad either one Mom had seen the doc once and HE did RX them dad picked them up and she hid them in purse ]THANK GOD I knew something was up and got them away from her With my wn experiences with the ativan ( was on them as well for yrs) I found I was losing my short term memory thought it was all to do with fibro but als it was not The ativan played a big part I believe as I quit them and feel so better for it Take very good care of you my friend Luvs God Bless LYN


 YOu may have to speak with your doc about upping your dose considering all that is /has gone on thats a small dosage I am on 30 mtgs of valium but I have been on and off of them for yrs I wish you all the best my friend Luvs LYN


 I hear ya on that one my friend I had a few nights with NO sleep Not good Take care you Luvs LYN"
What Else can Please help!!!!,I am the Care Taker for my Aunt she is quickly progressing with her Alzheimers she now forgets to use the bathroom and goes on herself not urine but bowel movement I have to constantly wash her clothes and remind her to go to the bathroom and to bathe her doctor said to put diapers on her she refuses I don't know what else to do any suggestions Thanks Guys. PR Glo,"Good idea Red I would do something like red has posted as well ...... PLZ do let us know


 I had similar issues and found a website: I spoke with Aaron, the site guy. He is a nursing home administrator and has lots of good ideas and has the info I needed and the names of companies to contact. He helped me alot. Try it out. Hope things get better Tyno For these type of websites and names of ppl you must have the Administrators approval prior to posting....... I know you are trying to help and I appreciate it but I have to abide by rules as does all God Bless Lyn Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 2/27/2009 4:34:29 PM (GMT-7)


 At first my Gma didn't want to wear diapers either but Depends makes some great diapers that feel and appear like regular panties. You can buy some and just tell your aunt that they're new underwear - she may not be able to tell the difference.


 i did the same for my partner when she refused diapers ( she would tear them off because they were for ""babies"" she would say )....they have ones that are almost like panties and she had no problems wearing them.....but to be honest, i wore them the first few days and bragged how comfortable they were, she finally took to the idea.....


 Dear PR Glo: When my gramma had to switch to depends from regular panties, we got Tena which were pull ups. Also, we found some one piece jump suits (like combinations underwear), which helped while she got used to the Tena."
No Happy Endings,"This is not a fairy tale. Two years ago exactly, I was contacted by my Dad, requesting help. I dropped my job, left apartment and came to the rescue. Problem was, stepmother who had been covering for Dad's memory problems, for 15 years or so, developed kidney disease. He called me to help her, they both needed help. He was in total denial about his alzheimers. A couple of months in hades, trying to care for both of them in a leaky, wet, cold, falling down house, I called myself stepinfetchit, as my stepmother would bark orders from her bed, do this, make this, pass me this, get me untangled, etc. In May she was hospitalized, told she would not be going back to leaky, mould infested falling down house, and the doctor asked me if I wanted him to call Adult Protection, for my father. Not having any i'dea what was about to transpire, I said, leave it with me, Doctor. So they did. I embarked on one of the most difficult, frustrating, emotionally laden journeys of my life. For 18 months I endured my fathers thrice weekly, out of control violent rages. Then he began wandering in the night. Then he wandered into my bedroom w/o knocking. My Bull Mastiff pointed him in another direction. Then it got so I was spending hours standing out on the front stoop while he yelled and cursed inside the house. Then he broke down my bedroom door, pushing me back. Police came. He was told, ""never step foot in daughter's bedroom, ever. Cunning fox he was he tried the ""well what if there was a fire?""Mountie said, call 911. I got us moved into a beautiful, clean dry, house, right on the water and tried all kinds of activities with him, building birdhouses out of popsickle sticks, crosswords, nothing workI called my son to come up on Dec. 22, spend Christmas. We got through Christmas ok, but shortly, thereafter, Alzheimers victim assaulted my son. That was it. Mounties came with two ambulances and took him for psyche evaluation. He failed. deemed a danger to self and others. Now he sits in hospital, on side of bed, wondering what the heck went wrong, and awaiting placement. Right now, I am frustrated, burned out and angry. It Hurts. It feels like failure. Not a happy ending. Sibs poised like vultures, hundreds of miles away, awaiting opportunity to collect on the estate. Sound familiar, anyone?","i am so so sorry that this vicious, malicious disease has done this to you and your family....my thoughts and prayers are with you, and as red_34 said it is noone's fault it is this devil disease......


 I can't offer anything but continued prayers for your mental strength and health. Your sibs are worried about THINGS, none of which they can take with them when they leave this earth. You have already taken the better portion, spending time with your dad and stepmom while they were mostly lucid. Use whatever you need from their possessions to support them, pay bills and keep them in nursing home, etc. and ignore sibs. Their outlook, from the material standpoint, will always find fault with you, always be selfish, never forgive, never love... You are doing what you believe to be right. They can all go stew in their own juices! THINGS don't matter. PEOPLE do.


 Happy birthday Tyno! :) I know it's a bit bittersweet right now but remember that today is special because you were born on it.


 happy birthday tyno.....


 Hi, all: I took my Dad from his Nursing home to his wife's nursing home, yesterday, to update her about tumour. I gave her nurses a ""heads up"" and they had her sedated while we explained what it's all about . She seems to be losing ground also. She had a hip replacement, in January and she refuses to do the exercises the nurses are trying to get her moving. I sense it's a battleground, one I'll be staying out of. Explained and got agreement about selling the house. Brother says he's coming March 8th, Spring Break at University where he teaches. He said ""Ï could come sooner but I got the impression you (me) didn't want him to come sooner as you (I) sell the farm."" What BS. He can't come until spring break. I love how they twist things to make me look like the ""bad guy"". Anywho, Dad seems a lot happier. I guess being in a place with lots of people retired like him, him lets him forget all the things around the farm he used to try to keep up with but could not. Thank-you


 Oh honey, never feel like you've failed! You've had to endure more then any human can imagine! You have to know you did your best under the circumstances. Never ever blame yourself, nor your father......it is the disease that did this to him.


 Hello: I just had a bit of furthur detail, an up to dater, so to say. My Father is relatively content, in a Non-lockdown Seniors residence, just about twenty minutes from here. He is still wait-listed for a bed in the Nursing Home, that his wife is currently housed in. Generally, the Provincial Health Authority tries to place spouses in the same nursing home. My stepmother seems to enjoy most of her days where she is at. However, were my Dad to go to that particular home, he could probably be allowed to leave the locked unit, and visit with her twice a day. The staff on my stepmother's unit, know my Dad and like him, he can be funny and endearing, at the same time, when something isn't bothering him. Primarily, though, what I'm struggling with is, if he were to be moved to stepmom's facility, he would be on a ""lock-down unit,"" only allowed out when accompanied by staff, or family (I guess). My Steomom is relatively fragile (Four serious health problems, Stroke(s), Diabetes, recent hip replacement, and kidney Disease) She has to be hooked up to a dialysis machine (peritoneal dialysis) every four to six hours, and my understanding is that the process only clears out 20% or so, of toxins. She is not a candidate for a kidney implant due to her fragile condition due to the other factors, plus her age, plus she won't quit smoking. Then if she were to pass, and my Father was there b/c she is there, he would be in a locked facility, not the free to roam facility he now enjoys, (I guess). I'm not sure that if I were to move closer to the city, and he'd allready had a move from where he is to where she is, and she passes, since there is such a long wait list, they wouldn't be keen to move him a third time (nor would it be good for him as the disorientation is a biggy). I feel really isolated in all this decision making. All my sibs want to talk about is money. I was good enough to care for Dad 24/7/360, for two years and two months, but they consider me not responsible to handle the business (financial) aspect. However, since I am POA for both parents, and my Dad stipulated me while he was still mentally competent (Doctor's assessment, in writing) at the time he appointed me, as was she, they (my absentee sibs) have little power to influence the outcome(s) I know they are angry about all this, and I'm sorry for that but it is what it is. The farm will be sold this month to go towards settling the debt with the bank, and hopefully a few other outstanding bills but the house is about to be condemmed and burnt (by fire marshall b/c it's in terrible condition) For about five or more years they had leaks all over, the roof is caving, and were someone to clrawl in and have a roof fall on them, or the towering crumbling chimney, who would be blamed? Any thoughts?


 Dear Jeanie143, and everyone: I have to say, this forum is what gives me the strength needed to keep going. My family doesn't behave like a family, more like Stock Brokers whom we all know about as being self obsessed, money oriented, and not humanistic at all. Unfortunately, they come by it honestly. My bio Mom was and is exactly like that, God Bless Her. We don't speak, often. I feel really bad about that but there isn't anything I can do. I have tried emailing her, but emails come back, she probably has me black listed on her website. Today is my birthday. I had three emails from Healing Well, three from the Astro center, absolutely nothing from anyone else. My youngest son is here God Bless Him, getting me through February. This is the absolute worst month for me. It's not the age thing so much, or the weather, it just seems so barren and difficult. It makes me feel like getting a little camper truck, loading up the dogs, and heading out for Arizona. That would be what the other's are doing though, isn't it. Running. Thank-you all so very much.


 ..........Happy Birthday my dear friend I wish for you a day of peace and some actual relaxation today ........YOU have FAILED no one and plz know that We are all here for you hun I am so sorry you n your bio Mom are not getting on.......... Have a good one today PLEASE Luvs LYN


 Thank-you all, ya'll brought tears to my eyes. Good tears. Cleansing tears. It's like a blessing when we actually forget about everything pressing down on us, and just cry. It releases some feel good chemicals in the brain. Thank-you. I had a hard, hard day yesterday. I guess I should try to focus on the good things, like having a son to help and sometimes carry me when I'm too weak to do anything. When I am living in a beautiful house right on the water, when I have three solid white cats (supposed to bring good luck), and two dogs with their completely opposite cute little ways who love you, despite whatever you have said or done to offend is forgotten in an instance. When despite the bats and rafters and spiderwebs gathering all around, and skeletons tumbling out of the closet, there is this ever so faint gleam of hope on the horizon, which may actually account for why all this has to happen, all at once. When others mistake our kindness for stupidity. When what you had taken for family turn out to be ""imposters"" and what you thought of as ""the guy next door"", turns out to be your best friend and solace, helping in whatever little ways he or she can despite the avalanche falling all around. When you are so sore and feel like someone used you as a ""Heavy bag"" and beat the daylights out of you, the night before. When coincidentally, an appointment with a neurologist for your aging Dad, turns out to have bad news. Apparently, my Dad has been walking around with a golf ball sized tumour in his head, which may account for some of the sudden changes in behavior and demeanor. The tumour is not cancer, but it is large and pressing on areas of his brain, and potentially causing swelling that could be fatal. So, we have to have a MMRI, coming up. Sixty-five miles over hill and dale in falling apart car, which has all kinds of problems as a result of crashing into a ditch on a back road, because you're trying to do too much, trying to get it all done, all loose ends tied up before whatever lies ahead gets the jump on you. What I got from my brother when we delivered the news was a Christmas list of things he wants ""preserved for him"", sentimental value and all. Well, I told him Dad and spending time with Dad while he still is lucid enough to recognise his children, should be sentimental enough, for him. God Bless. ps. I would love to go out and get rip roaring drunk but I know I'll only feel way worse tomorrow.


 Update: Brother called while I was visiting Dad at the Home where I await further instructions re. his brain tumour. I think we may have a breakthrough. I took the phone and calmly explained my $749.00 a month pension does not allow me to run electricity on two houses much less pay rent on the one that's livable,and the mortgage on the falling down house. It sounded like he got it (maybe). He said he did. On the other hand I rec'd a lovely email from baby sis who used more four letter words than you can find in the dictionary. I guess she isn't coming to visit before Dad loses every wit he ever had. She can only visit him in Nursing home b/c last time she took him joyriding w/o clearance, they got stuck, he had to push them out of the mudhole, and they were drinking. Dad seems quite happy where he is. He is free to roam, inside the facility and I try to get him out 1-2 times a week. Thank-you"
My Grandfather was diagnosed 2 years ago,"I've been scouting the alzhiemer's forum here and finally have decided to post. Alziemer's runs in my family. My Grandfather was diagnosed 2 years ago and has been living in a home off island since. His mother also suffered from it, and although none of his children have lived to be old enough to display characteristics, the similiarity between my dad and grandfather is uncanny - and I fear he will also develop it. I can say that it is a horrible disease, that has robbed my grandpa from so many things. I have only been able to visit him a few times, but have been planning to go visit him again soon, since my grandmother has been receiving cancer treatment in the same town. I was planning to read him poetry... since he has always loved it, The Cremation of Sam McGee actually. At a time he could recite the whole thing perfectly. I miss him, and just wanted to wish everybody who has, or deals with family members with this disease, my best wishes. It's difficult to see my grandpa on the slim chances I get, but I have so much respect for people who devote their lives to them You're all heroes in my eyes. - Corrie","I totally agree I too wish you are able to see him soon as possible Stay here with us .........

 Hello everyone!! I, too have been scouting this forum for some time... My dad, (74y/o) was diagnosed with AD (moderate-severe type) a few months back but it finally sank in yesterday after his neurologist explained what the result of his MRI meant.. My mom patiently is with him all the time and sometimes i know it wears her out taking care of him.. i drive them to their appointments bec my mom does not drive After reading some of the posts, i'm always reminded that he was once a very nurturing, caring and loving dad.. Then it reminds me that it's my turn to share a helping hand when needed. I feel sad why it had to happen to him, i'm hoping for a miracle..

 Welcome back Snowy. :) Our moderator Lyn has been having some health troubles lately so I've been sort of unofficially helping her out here on the Alzheimers forum.


 Welcome back SnoweyLynn; It bites when one's computer goes awol. It was happening to me, frequently during Christmas. I had to clean up my harddrive, using Manufacturer's Default disks. I felt like I was cut off from my entire online family. Nearly had the DT's.


 SNOWY Great to see you and I am glad you have puter working again......Take care of you plz I DO care we have been on a journey together for along time now eh ........ Pnuemo is hard and I am hoping it wont bog you down again........ Say hello to Larry for me plz Luvs LYN I am doing just dandy now .........


 You're welcome sweetie. I know you've had a lot on your plate and I don't mind helping a friend. Co mod? Umm not sure about that one lol. I really don't know a whole lot about Alzheimers and not nearly as much as you! But I can pop in here from time to time and help you when things get tough for you."
..Are You The Type That Can Be  A Caregiver...........????????????????,...Do you have the patience ....Do you have the EMPATHY ......DO You want What is Best for your loved one /or not....... Do you call them Names?? **If so remember they are in THERE and they do hear........** There are those that cannot deal with the /all faucets of caregiving.....\ Are you one of those people /Loved ones?????????,"i consider myself a good caregiver.... not perfect, but any mistakes i make are always because i want what is best for my partner.......i know i'm not dealing for an elderly parent as most are, but respect doesn't have an age limit and calling names or yelling is a plain and simple lack of respect in my eyes......the ""golden rule"" should always apply.... lyn i hope you reconsider your worth on this forum....i have learned alot from your posts...... lynnie

 I have written MANY posts re: the aspects of all there is to this and I know I have given my heart to this forum I will continue for a bit longer but I have to say I think the time has come where I have served my purpose here TRY reading some of the threads......... I am NOT flaming anyone ............. LYN


 Lyn, you have been there for me when I was dealing with my grandmother and you still are. I would sorely miss you if you were to leave. But if in the event you feel you must then know that my thoughts are with you. Not everyone is meant to be a caregiver and when I knew that I just couldn't handle it anymore I knew that it was time to move my Gma out and give me a much needed rest you were there for me. Of course I never abused her, verbally or otherwise but I knew that I just couldn't handle it both mentally and physically anymore. You were there for me when I made that tough decision and helped much more then you can possibly know. Really, you shouldn't let one post upset you so. I know it's rough to read these things and not want to yell but we can not control the world - I know what it is that you are referring to. I couldn't get myself to respond because I was shocked. If you feel the need to step away from HW, either permanently or temporarily I can take over the AZ forum for you if you wish. I don't know as much as you but I am willing to give it my best.


 .......I will clarify This post /thread is for ONE person............ The rest of you are tops in all you do for those you love /care/ and so support Love to all God Bless LYN IF only we had a better world with a far better understanding of this DD and what it does............. I KNOW you all DO"
Family?,"I know I have beat this drum before, but since my Alz. Victimized Dad has been found to have a brain tumour the size of a golf ball pressing on his brain, things have become more urgent. the neurologist said he is not a candidate for brain surgery, but if they have no other choice (after they see the MRI, which I had to fight for), the neurologist said they may have no choice. Were this to be the case, he would have a 20% chance of survival. Two years ago, the PCP ordered a MRI but back then my Dad was seeped in negativity and firmly refused to go. We tried everything but he remained in bed with his head under the blankets and wouldn't get up. So, the test didn't get done. Two years later, we're in this pickle. So, due to the fact my Dad cannot string a sentence together, I have asked for an extension on my lease, twenty miles from Dad's LTC facility, in order for Family members to come at their leisure. In the meantime I have been gathering all important belongings and stashing them with friends and neighbors, as I will have to leave here in May, and I don't want to deal with thirty-five years of accumulated stuff. Therefore, the various family members can choose what they want. In addition to that, as the LTC takes all Dad and his wife's pensions, no mortgage payments have been made and the bank will foreclose. So, I found a buyer. We will net enough to pay off the mortgage and a few other outstanding bills around town. That's it. Well, the emails I have gotten from my sibs are devastating. I thought it was bad when they just remained aloof from it all. Now they are calling me a thief and a liar. I am not particularly well myself, I have been doing this eldercare here for 28 months without help, except from my neighbors and a retired minister. I rented on the water, with lots of land b/c I thought Dad would be happy here. I am stuck here alone, in this big house because Dad became unmanageable, he is a big strong man and he started mixing me up with his wife who gambled all his money away ergo: the Mortgage. He insisted the mortgage was paid out several years ago. The local constabulary advised me to place him. The tumour must be on his happy place in his head, b/c he seems quite happy there.","My dad apparently had a melonoma on his nose. He and his wife, my stepmom, kept insisting it was just a blood vessel which was swollen due to a little dog bite twenty years ago. Anyway, when I arrived on the scene we got it removed, but according to my doc, b/c it was on his nose it could easily spread through the sinus into the brain. Yes, I definitely think it contributed to his aggressive behavior. We have a lot of BiPolar Illness in our family. Some of us go for treatment, some don't. The ones that don't are the hardest to deal with. I also think it's a way of staying disconnected but avoiding feeling guilt. If I am ""the bad guy,"" it's a convenient excuse to stay away. Thank-you for helping me sort through that.


 h Thanks: I pretty much have. i have a neighbor, his wife and a minister, informed of every move I make regarding the parents. The stepmom seems to be going down hill fast. I wrote her son and told him about it. He's the only civil one in the bunch. He has major health problems of his own. i told him I'd get him here by whatever means possible to see her if he wants. The others remain hostile so they don't have to deal with it all.


 You know what they say....you can't choose your family but you can ignore them. I think it is horrible what your siblings are doing to you. I don't know all sides of the story but it seems to me that they are very selfish individuals and are using you as the scapegoat. I'm sorry to hear about your fathers tumor. Do you suppose this was the reason for his violent outbursts?


 Tell the family to go suck a raw egg,lol.........


 AS you know I was the BAD guy too with Mom and Dad but when push comes to shove the family was never there to help with anything EVER Dad did have brain cancer and with the AD he was a man I did not know .........happy in his world and I went there at times to be with him I know he is not in pain and I know I DID right by him and Mom HOLD your head HIGH.......... Take care my friend God Bless LYN"
My mother eats less and less... anyone know why?  Is this typical?,"Hello Everyone, Mother is 85 and has had dementia or alzheimer's for over six years. The problem is that she eats less and less and will only eat certain things. Is this typical of someone with this disease? She also sleeps a lot too. Does this go along with it? Used to get her different high calorie vitamin drinks, malts, etc. but that only lasted so long until she tired of them. Now, just get her what we know she will eat. For while now, it has been those snack packs of cheese crackers with peanut butter inside. And that's about all she will eat, except chocolate.. she still loves her chocolate. (me, too... must have gotten it from her Mom and Dad were married almost 25 years when he died during surgery. At the time, I was 24 and married, my brother was 19 and we had a younger sister who was nine. Although mother never married again, she did finally meet someone and they went together for about twenty years, then he eventually passed away. Before mother became ill, she would tell me if I would stop in around March 6th, that was the day that her and dad had gotten married back in 1943. But now, we show her pictures of dad and she has no idea who he is at all. Yet, she can remember his mother. Of course, Dad has been gone a long time now... but it's strange to my brother and I that she has no memory of him at all. We know that this goes along with the disease, yet it is still sad. Mother was always so independent and such a hard worker all of her life and very clean with her home and herself. Now, if she hasn't had a bath for two weeks, she thinks she had one yesterday. She has always been the kind of person who did not like having someone tell them what to do, so she will argue brother if he tries to push her to eat, etc. But mostly she is in a good mood. She really doesn't know what Christmas is or the other holidays and if we tell her she will remember, but then she forgets pretty quickly. It seems like she remembers her childhood and the people and things that happened back then,but can't remember hardly anything about being married and raising my brother and sister and I and helping out with the grandchildren until they were pretty well grown. She hardly has any recollection of it at all. Has anyone found any kind of vitamins that help. She takes the one medication that is supposed to help her memory and I really believe that it has helped to slow the progression down and we are very grateful for that. I just wondered if there might be something else out there that we don't know about . Happy New Year To All, Wiggyann","I agree the food intake is totaly different with this DD I know my dad was not wanting to eat and he loved his food Mom ate like a chicken and would tell us"" oh ya I ate"" ya right she had fed it too the dog Maybe if you can get the doc to order some Ensure it will at least keep her body in more of a balance with potassium and other vitamins needed Keep us posted plz LYN


 That is a great idea even if it only worked for awhile Lynnie Supplements like Ensure would be an idea to pass by your doc IMHO LYN


 WE are with you all the way my friend If he likes Peanut butter she will get good nutrients from that as well as potassium from bananas I do hope you find a way about this My Mom weighed 65 lbs at time of death......... Really scary it was......... You can do many things with ensure to see if she will take to it again like milkshakes and such Luvs LYN


 Hello- My father just passed in December at 86. He had Vascular Dementia. My Mom is 76, and is happy as a child, with mid-stage Alzheimers. Our unresolved issues just had to be shelved. End of story. I have several good articles about certain nutrients and blood levels that pertain to optimal health for the elderly with dementias. I'll paste part of one below. I'm blogging now. I'll share the sites. I have info on there also, and will continue to post. www.leangreencafe.blogspot.com www.ladyofthelake-vernonialake.blogspot.com Enjoy and feel free to comment. I like certain multivitamins and natural supplements because they are proven to get into the bloodstream quickly. (Bioavailable.) I like a tiny probiotic that really helps with indigestion and the immune system. Makes life easier. What is important to us, as we strive to keep our parents alive, may no longer be important to them. It takes some juggling to interest someone in food with cachexia, for instance, as we never know what types of diseases they really have sometimes, and dementias. My father would wait till I left the room and pour his water into my plants. I would have to sit there to make sure he was 'hydrated'. (There is a great drink that hydrates people, with electrolytes and potassium-rich with juice. )If I was to go downstairs, his footsteps would quickly head for the ice cream in the fridge, or the graham crackers, or the strawberry freezer jam (1/2 a pint by spoon) with dollops of powdered sugar set out for waffles. I made two video tapes of him to share with my siblings when he was gone, to answer some of the questions they could have about his history, and thus, theirs. We briefly laughed about the ice cream in one of the videos. If I left bananas out, he would forget he had one, and sometimes could scarf 3 down. I worried about the opposite sometimes-him gaining such a paunch that I would have a harder time showering him, etc. He loved my cooking. The smells helped his appetite. I like certain meal shakes, without any artificial sweeteners, colors or flavorings. There are cocoa and vanilla ones that even my grandkids liked. You can add strawberries to the vanilla, especially frozen ones, and peanut or almond or cashew butter to the cocoa ones. I like certain soy protein drinks, non-GMO, lightly cooked to take out the thyroid harming part, 50% calcium added for bone density and to neutralize the acidity of soy. I have some great smoothie recipes. Snack plates of fruit, cheeses, cream cheese on soft bagels, graham crackers w/ nut butter, cream cheese, or a treat w/ frosting. Snack or protein bars cut up in cubes for tooth-challenged folks. Hummus w/ crackers, cucumbers and soft pita bread. There are some great recipes for hummus, that use varied foods and spices, etc. Well, I'm writing another book. I tend to do that. Enjoy this blurb from an article. Elevated levels of homocysteine is an indication of inadequate folate and vitamin B-12 in the diet, writes lead author Giovanni Ravaglia, a researcher with University Hospital S. Orsola-Malpighi in <st1:place><st1:City>Bologna</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Italy</st1:country-region></st1:place>. His paper appears in the March American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In their study, researchers tested the blood of 650 elderly Italians -- with no signs of dementia or Alzheimer's disease -- looking at levels of folate and vitamin B-12. They also asked about other dietary factors such as coffee, wine, and liquor consumption and about physical activity. Researchers found that those with lower scores on tests of thinking ability had high levels of homocysteine. They found the same association even after taking into account other risk factors for dementia, including age, socioeconomic status, and risk factors for heart disease. Some study participants may have early or very mild cognitive impairment, especially those whose scores on the tests were low. People with early dementia often perform within normal limits on cognitive tests, Ravaglia writes. Though nutritional deficiencies can be the cause, some medications like the seizure drug Dilantin can elevate homocysteine levels in the blood. Kidney disease, alcohol use, and too little physical activity can also elevate homocysteine. High homocysteine levels can be treated very easily with vitamins, including folate, niacin, and B-12. Cereals are now fortified with folate, niacin is found in fresh fruits, and B-12 is in red meat. <o:p></o:p></p> Personally, I'm a bit picky when it comes to my parents, or family and vitamins. A good BComplex can do wonders. I would never recommend taking a B vitamin in a high dose, by itself, for instance. You can deplete the others. Alfalfa leafies in a tablet or tea can aid arthritis pain for them. Hope this helps. ** I removed your email and blog for security and safety reasons PPL can get in touch with you thru email at side as long as you have it posted PPL that are not members can get all info from your posts that is why it is not good to insert emails and personal info in posts Email me if you have any questions LYN Post Edited By Moderator (Howlyncat) : 1/24/2009 4:20:34 PM (GMT-7)


 Hey! I have worked in Long Term Care / Skilled Nursing for over 6 years. I am not a nurse, but have and do attend workshops, educational meetings, and so on about Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately with this disease, our loved ones are robbed of their memories and often revert back to their childhood. I have learned that often times a patient suffering with this disease usually ""forgets"" their children before their spouse because of the regression back into their younger days. We have patients varying in ages from 80 all the way to 102 that still want us to ""call"" their mother on a daily basis. When dealing with a patient suffering in this way, it is always best to ""enter their world"" when you are around them. Always approach from the side, never from the front because this causes the patient to feel threatened. You may already know this, but it is amazing that an Alzheimers patient can remember how they ""feel"" around a certain person, but not specifically who that person is or was to them! As far as the sleeping, eating, and not bathing goes, that is genuinly just the progression of the disease. That is very common. More often than not, Alzheimers patients will need Speech Therapy to help with their swallowing because of the progression of Alzheimers. Speech Therapy is not limited to ""Dysphagia"" or swallowing, they also help with the loss of cognitive ability that tells a person that they are hungry and also how to put fork to plate and then to mouth with food. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! I really have learned so much about this heartbreaking disease and I deal with it everyday.


 So great to see you G Padraig been thinking of you so much I know that Christmas had to be tough Ot was hard for me as well............... On my BD I was kinda expecting to hear dad calling saying ""Happy Birhtday my pet"" but alas there must not be phones in Heaven I am really having a mich harder time with his passing then I am with Moms Though I loved them equally I cannot figure whats going on Part of me still does not accept she is gone and I will never see or hear her ever again well not till my time comes Butterfly kisses and God Bless and thanks for input You are a very wise man my mentor..........Luvs...........LYN


 Before my Gma was officially diagnosed there was a time that me and the hubby had to leave for a day to take care of business. I left some food for her to eat. When I got home, I found that she only took two bites of it and she told me that she ate what she could. So I think that if it was left up to her that she would either forget to eat or just not want to. I do believe that these food issues come with either age or the disease. I know now she eats only because that is the main rule of the assisted living center she is in; to eat 3 meals a day. But before then she wouldn't eat a whole lot or she would hoard food in her room but not eat it.


 my partner also went through an ""i don't like this stage"".....a friend of mine who works with special needs kids gave me some flashcard type things with pictures of food on it so she would pick which foods she would eat for that meal....she would sometimes only eat a few bites but she liked playing different games with the cards and looked forward to it before meals.... eventually that wore out as well but it worked and helped for awhile.......


 Many Thanks to Red, Lyn and Lynnie for your help. We have been the insure route until mother would not drink anymore of it, but we know it helped her when she did drink it. I guess there are no easy answers. Actually, over a period of about three years we watched her go from 84 pounds up to 90 lbs eating mostly snack foods because that is all she would eat most of the time, so I guess that's not too bad. We were amazed one day when she stepped on the scale and it registered 90. because we couldn't tell that she had gained any weight. I'm not sure what she weighs now, but she hardly eats much of anything. This is still so different for us even though it's been over six years now. No one in our family has had anything like this before on either side. And both of mother's sisters are fine. I guess i just don't understand. Thanks for bearing with me... Wiggyann


 Thanks Dear Lyn, May I ask how old your mother was when she passed away and how long she had been ill with alzheimer's? Also, did anyone else in your family ever have this disease? Bless you, dear lady Wiggyann


 Mom was 70 and Dad 74 Mom had been sick for a few yrs dad fell sick just after Mom passed he diesd almost 2 yrs to the day of her death I also believe it was partially of a broken heart THEY had a very special love Luvs LYN


 Not only Alzheimer's victims return to the past. In the winter of our years when there is little left to look forward to in a strange world we tend to find peace in a place and time we are familiar with i. e. childhood. I'm in my 78th year which has given me an advantage over younger people caring for their loved ones. I was also fortunate to be fit enough to provide the best care possible for my wife, ie 24/7 365 days a year for four years and eight months in our home until she passed away. The pain and hurt I endured in the early years was due to the treatment my wife was receiving before and after I placed her in a NH. It comes as no surprise that I now fear ever being 'put away' and should I ever have the misfortune to end up with AD, you bet I'll fight anyone that tries to take away control of my life. To have taken my wife from the NH, stopping all medication, with the exception of liquid paracetamol and caring alone I managed to undo the damage inflicted by people that should have known better. Two weeks ago the Royal College of Psychiatrists stated that certain medications administered to AD patients shortened lives. My wife was walking and talking up to the time she had a fall that resulted in her having to go into hospital. She came out a month later in a wheelchair and with little speech. Much later I learned they had administered drugs to keep her calm!! She was a quiet gentle person. By the time I got her home she had pressure sores all over, even on a heel, she was less than 80lbs, not eating etc. Yes she regressed to being a child and like any child was well aware of those around with compassion and love. I could go on and on but I'm entering that stage in my book about our experiences with with this DD. It has left me so scared that I'm still out running six miles every morning and other heavy exercises to keep and well from becoming ill. The final years caring alone were a real joy for me and I believe also my wife as she regained weight and health. May your God go with you. Padraig


 Hi Wiggyann Is your mother on any medication that can reduce appetite? It might be worth checking everything out on the internet. My mum has quite severe arthritis as well as AD and for a time she was prescribed Codeine and Paracetamol. Almost overnight she lost her appetite and became constipated. We then treated the constipation and she had diarrhoea... This went on for a couple of weeks when I told the doctor I couldn't continue with the tablets as I thought they were affecting her. He denied it, but of course I went on the internet and found it's a well known side effect. She was then given a pain killing patch which worked well. It took weeks to get Mum's appetite back but she gradually began eating again to the extent that some days she had three breakfasts and two lunches because she'd forgotten she'd eaten! Unfortunately the disease takes its toll and as she has got worse her appetite has decreased and she's now very thin, but like your Mum she still enjoys chocolate! You mentioned that she can't remember her husband. A few months ago mum kept asking why her husband hadn't been to see her in hospital. I gently told her he'd died in 1990, to which she replied, 'No not that one, the other one!' I said 'There isn't another one, you were only married once'. And she was quite insistent that even if she hadn't married, that she'd lived with someone, who must be away on business. I asked if he wouldn't be retired and she snorted and said 'Of course not, he's only 60!' I was laughing so much I couldn't manage to say but mum you're 92!! Sometimes you have to laugh, it makes it a bit more bearable! Erin"
worried about stiffness in arms and legs,"hi.....something scary is happening with my partner.......i have noticed a stiffness in her arms and legs over the past couple of weeks....i do the range of motion exercises (which is getting more difficult) and massage her arms and legs everyday...... today when i tried to put her in the chair to change her bedding, i had an awlful time trying to move her and not hurt her....... at first i thought she was tensing upon me on purpose but now i'm not sure what is going on.......is this common with progression and is there anything i can do about it?","padraig, thank you....it's not the answer i wanted but it is the answer i needed....so many things are changing and it gets scary at times..... i admire the strength you had while taking care of your wife....i have never met a man who would do as you did...you're a wonderful man.... i know my partner is progressing and it's breaking my heart........but i will be strong, i won't let her down..... lynnie


 Lynnie Charlie gave you the proper answer I know you love her and I know this is Very hard on you I am keeping you in my heart .......... I would continue the ROM exercises if I were you Luvs LYN


 I'm sorry to learn your partner is so very ill. I've been there so many times when my wife had to be rushed to hospital. There were a number of times I had to have her rushed to ER. The first time I let them stop being present while they attended to her. The next time I made it plain that no one was going to keep us apart. It took a lot of explaining to the lady doctor who was attending to my wife that she would respond better to any treatment knowing I was present and to hear my voice. I explained that she had regressed to being a child and therefore she needed the comforting voice of some one she trusted. When she recovered and we were leaving I thanked the doctor, she shook my hand: ""No, I thank you, I've learned more about Alzheimer's to-day."" The Government here have just started a five year plan to teach doctors more about dementia. I'd say you require more support than you are at present receiving. I managed simply because I'm a 'one off', it's a lonely place to be. It was a mind set that I adopted, there is no cure and like everyone else there is only one end, for some it is sudden others prolonged. I chose to see my wife and I travel the river of life. We were in a tiny boat I called NOW and kept reminding myself that all I had was that precious moment NOW to be stored away as treasure. When each of the special moments would be no more I would know I did not waste them. Don't know if this is of any use. I'll be thinking and of you both. God bless. Padraig


 i know just what you mean about having to fight for the right to be present in the er.....my partner does so much better and is more relaxed when she can see that i am with her......even though i have poa and we have been partners for 20 yrs, i sometimes have to be very assertive and insistant about staying with her...... anyways.....she is back home today and mumbling away, the stiffness is worse since she was in the hospital but i will get some of that worked out i hope with rom exercises.... all is good on my little speck of the earth tonight.....i pray the same for all of you....


 Hi lynnie, Sorry to tell you yes it is part of the progression. Rigidity set in on my wife when she was in the Nursing Home. There they gave her medication for it, but as I said before I stopped all medication after I removed her from the NH. For a time she had the shakes, I thought that was part of the progression, but it soon stopped, it was withdrawal symptoms. Like you I kept up motion exercises and massages. Though there was little improvement it did not stop me moving her about by hoist in the house, on to the commode to wheel her into the bathroom to wash and shower her. I also hoisted her into her wheelchair, then strapped her waist and legs, took her for walks; lifted her into and out of the car to take her shopping twice a week. Where ever I went I took her along with me even to the dentist for my check-ups. For the final period, just short of five years she was stiff, but we got by and I learned so very much not only about Alzheimer's. I learned the right mind set on how to manage alone, also few men get the chance to look after a big baby, do the shopping, cooking, washing, ironing, cleaning and all the many every day things women for us for years. It sure makes one feel humble. The best she could do with one hand was to raise it chest high. You may also notice her hands curl and bend in at the wrists. Please don't let the progression scare you, treasure each moment banish the future from your mind. The future is what we all fear, i. e. the unknown just welcome each moment that comes. I wish you well. Padraig


 lynnie, None of us want to learn painful facts in life and as for being a wonderful man I don't think so. Like most other people I went through the whole range of emotions in the early years of my wife's illness. The worst period was from the day of her fall and my walking her into hospital from where she came out a month later in a wheel chair. Her year in the NH was sheer hell, I was paying good money and yet spending up to nine hours a day with her. I was at war with the staff all the time. They failed to understand the meaning of our love. The reason I first came on this site years back was to discover if anyone had, of was attempting to care for a loved one alone when they were in the final stage. All the information was to say that it was not possible. I still think that is the case for most people but I believe it can be done with help and support. It was my choice to go it alone. Life is lonely and empty now and it is painful writing the part of our story living with Alzheimer's. I could not just write about AD, because I accept that parts of the story may seem unbelievable, I guess that is why I was referred to as 'a one off that kept pushing the boundaries'. Little did they know how much a 'one off' I am. I'm no longer ashamed of having served fourteen years in Industrial Schools in Ireland. Whilst caring for my wife in 2006 I managed to write the first part of my story in bits (while she slept) and had it published in 2007. It was early 2006 I discovered for the first time the reason I was locked away. I was charged as a two year old with begging at Dublin DC and ordered to be detained. To this day I have never discovered why I was abandoned, I guess they were ashamed of me. Once I'd experienced, or would accept the loving touch of another human, my wife, I'd entered a new and strange world. That beautiful young quiet gentle girl was my inspiration to achieve goals that many only dream of. She was the Mom the friend I never had up to 21yr old. Why would I not consider her life more important than mine. We were one, what she lacked I provided. My purpose for living was to make her life the best it could be, that in turn made me happy. When you love someone it's all the way, 52 years two months and 19 days. I've had the rare privilege of learning first hand about the 'final stage.' Sorry to have gone on so long but if I can be of help to others that would be nice. Love is powerful, God bless. Padraig


 thank you both for your replies...i know it's the progression i was just hoping there was a miracle way to stop it...... it's late and i'm sitting her feeling very helpless and scared.....i'm afraid my partner has pneumonia again....she's having the fevers and the raspy breathing.....i don't want her to have to go back to the hospital....i know i won't sleep tonight so i'm going to find something to read to keep me occupied....and of course i'll be praying


 What Beautiful words of WISDOM my mentor Butterfly Kisses God Bless Luv LYN


 Once you decide that you have taken complete control of all aspects of your partners welfare the better both of you will feel. Seek advice of doctors for physical problems by all means, but in the end, with all the facts you make the final decision, because you will know her better than them. One thing I have learned, sadly too late, is that medical people believe in what they are doing, because that is how they are trained. One size does not fit all. Had I questioned the medication being administered to my wife in the beginning she would not have suffered as she did. I'm presently writing in my book about Alzheimer's years. With all the medical notes, film and photos it is clear to see that most of the medication prescribed was for the avoidable physical damaged inflicted on her. Damage that was considered to be part of the illness! The most serious damage inflicted was in hospital where she was sedated without my knowledge. Is it any wonder that after walking into hospital she came out in a wheelchair. My final decision to take my wife home, stop all medication and to not accept help with her care was taken out of frustration and anger. Life became less stressful being in control and when she did require treatment for her pressure sores and other injuries I administered them until she recovered. For most of her final four years the only medication she had was a drop of laxative in her drink. Rigidity remained during those years, but it did not stop me strapping her in her wheelchair and taking her out. It's very important to let them know that you and your partner are a unit and must be considered as such the same as they would a mother and child. Get as much support as you possibly can when the going gets tougher but stay in charge. Hang in there. Padraig"
"Aunt with Alzheimer’s, have to make important decisions","Hi Guys Im back again my Aunt is 70yrs old and has Alzheimers she has always lived alone but she has progressed rather fast she has three son's one of them moved down with her to help her as she can longer live on her own but taking care of her 24 hours a day is too much for him and he also has his family he needs to tend to so he will be going back to Puerto Rico with his Family and her other two sons have families also but do nothing for her not even a phone call to see how she is doing and the funny thing is she remembers every once in a while and say my son's don't ever call me I have to call them what's going on with them. It has been rather difficult for me as I have been her primary care taker since she was diagnosed in december 2007 or January 2008 and even before then because I always felt something was wrong with my aunt I take her shopping, I take her out to my house or out for lunch, I pick up her meds take her to Dr's appt's as my job permitted with no help from her sons at all. her doctor's contact me with anything that goes on. I finally got her involved with a program that is suppossed to alleviate some of the stress they help a bit a nurse comes once a week to administer meds and take her vital signs, she has a medicine box that rings for her to take her meds that defeats the purpose because she needs her son to actually put them in her mouth for her to take them, she leaves the stove on all the time, she doesn't clean anymore she thinks she does but she doesn't she has clutter everywhere and her apartment is small she hords everything and the newest thing is she thinks everyone is stealing from her and check her purse evry 15 minutes as she also has high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes (Not insulin dependent) I am only her niece so ther are lots of decisions I can not make with out consulting with her sons even though they do nothing for her so my hands are tied with a lot of decisions that should be made. My aunt no longer wants to bathe or change her clothes she will wear the same outfir 5 days if you let her and she hides her meds she doesn't want to take them her sugar is high because she hords candy chocolates, ice cream and eats and eats I don't live with her and have to work so I can not care for her 24 hours a aday and once her son leaves I don't know what else to do. My mom tried to take her to lice with her but she became very aggressive with her and went back to her apartment. I took her to her doctor this week and they have noticed the change in her and the fact tha she can no longer live on her own and since she will not live with anybody else because she gets sooo aggressive and we all work and her son's won't take with them her doctor wants me to visit some assisted living places with her and she needs to choose one or if not her Doctor will document and send to elderly protective services a request for a conservator and pick a place to put her in because they feel she could be a danger to others and herself. I know the doctor is right but I feel very sad, mad and frustrated with all of this can someone give me advise on what I should feel or what I should Do. Please help anyone. I just want my Aunt to be safe and okay. PR Glo","I'm so sorry you and your aunt are having to go through this. Heartbreaking for you and terribly confusing for her. It does definitely sound as if she isn't safe living on her own now. The doctor's suggestions sound right on track, as they would provide the legal representative she so desparately needs to make decisions for her. If you're interested, you might inquire as to the possibility of your becoming her conservator, but in my experience most professionals who serve as conservators will consult with family when making big decision. I don't know what state you're in, but also consider checking with your state agency that serves elders - they should have information available on conservatorship to help you understand the ins and outs of the system. If your aunt is admitted to a facility by her conservator, she will not be allowed to leave without that person's approval. Hopefully the activities and routine would help keep her occupied so she wouldn't think about leaving. If not, be prepared for her to be in a locked section of the home and/or to be given medication to reduce her agitation. Good luck to both of you, and my heart goes out to you.


 My mother is going through the same thing. She is in her own home but can't manage right now. I hired meals on wheels and ""Visiting Angels"". It is a little pricey but a lot less than a full time nurse. Look them up. Hopefully they are in your area...


 hey pr jlo. E mail me if you can. I'm at aol. I would so like to discuss what our options are. Lyn is awesome an helps alot...


 I do wish you all the best in what you do end up doing .. LYN


 PR Glo, Sorry you are going through this. I wish I could give you advice, but unfortunately, this is fairly new to me, too. Try to find an alzheimer's support group in your area. You may be able to network with other people who may have some good suggestions for you. Best wishes, Cindy


 Each poster is spot on you's will need to to get ahold of your nearest Alzheimers Organization or other seniors advocates to help you out with your aunt Judilyn is right no one can take her out of there w/o conversators okay and approval Also she may well have to be in the locked ward the home to help her and keep her safe as well as medicated....... My heart is also with you You have alot to do and many decisions to make Know that you are not alone we are here to help..... LYN


 YOU can also have Community Care Access come in daily You have to have the doc RX it Or make sure if you are having to put her in a home check out the Nursing Home thread LYN


 Hi pr glo: I was involved with my Paternal Grandmother's care, in her own home by my Dad and Stepmom, but it was pointed out to me by one of my Doctor's that the responsibility regarding an aging and perhaps demented parent, rests on the shoulders of the immediate children of that parent. It sounds as though one son has tried but found it to be too much and the other two are distancing themselves from the situation. This is happening in my family, as well. I am sole caregiver for my 73 yr. old Dad who has alzheimers, my brother has clearly stated that his first priority is his wife and children, while my sister chooses to distance herself by being completely hostile towards me. It sounds like you have a heart and want to see your aunt properly cared for. It may come to pass that the family doctor is correct in his assessment that your aunt is a danger to herself, at least, and may need to be institutionalized. You perhaps could assist by helping her shop for nursing homes, in order to get her the best possible care, preferably one with the more humanistic approach of not locking Alzheimers patients up, but rather, allow them freedom to move about but they employ ""minders"", people who's job it is to standby and make sure everybody is allright and not a danger to themselves or other residents. It is very good of you to want to assist, but it is ultimately the responsibility of her children to see she is properly cared for. If they choose to distance themselves, then the state becomes involved through Protective Services for Elderly and Disabled. Trust me, they will abdicate the ""shopping for a suitable placement"" to you, if you are willing and able to assist.

Had a bad day,"It is all I can do to move. I hurt all over from my Fibromyalgia, and hurt worse due to wanting to go over to that hospital where my Dad is being held, and get him home. He's in the hospital due to aggressive behavior and the incidents were becoming more severe and more defiant. I couldn't get him to back off when he was in one of his bad moods, and sometimes that would go , like that for days. I had a lock put on my door but sometimes forgot to lock it. The wandering at night increased. He would open my bedroom doorin the middle of the night and scare me half to deat. When he attempted to assault my son, his granson, I got between them and asked him to back off. He would not. So I called the mounties. How awful this DD is. I don't know the vacant eyed man whom people call my Dad. All I know is, he scared me almost to death with his violent and verbally aggressive behavior for two looooooooong years. Thank-you, I had to get that off my chest.","Thank-you Lyn for your kind words. We (my son and I) moved my Dad, yesterday, to a nursing home, 15 miles away. I feel a bit better today, but am completely out of strength by 2 PM. I generally get up fairly early, I have some pain meds but they always run out a couple days early, before the next refill. I know better but sometimes after I take the recommended dose, and still hurt after 2 hours, I'll take a third pill. I told my doc and he didn't seem to be too concerned because it's a mild narcotic, and I try to make up by skipping my nighttime dose, but it becomes a vicious cycle, then I wake up in even more pain. Soooo, take meds as directed. There is a rationale for why they are prescribed as they are. Sometimes we think we're smarter, but we aren't. No med is going to take away 100% of the pain. It just takes the sharp edges off. My Dad is settling into the new place. I may go this evening or tomorrow for sure. I am back to bed now till I stop hurting.


 Thank-goodness it's not just me. I used be on a much more potent pain med, Lortab 10, and then my Doc here, wanted me to try to get by with a compound only about 1/2 as strong. I do my best, but it's not enough sometimes. I find here (in Canada) they are much stricter and are hesitant to give you anything. I had a triple extraction hugh molar, it split in three pieces and all kinds of gum was excised, I had to beg for medication. She gave me enough for two days, i didn;t get to see Dad today, I konked out once my head hit the pillow. Tomorrow.


 I musta said a bad word or sometjing. Howlyncat, I just wrote a too wordy reply to your suggestion of getting my Doc to wake up re. stronger meds. Anyway, you're absolutely right, but here for whatever reason, they only give the really effective stuff to cancer patients. That leaves us ""Trying to function despite constant, debilitating pain""with watered down Percocet, a pat on the back and a ""don't let the door hit you on the way out. I am going to inquire about a patch. I think constant release methods takes the guess work out of how to stay ahead of the pain. Once it sets in, it takes extra medicine over a longer time frame to get an effective management going. We digress, I went to the nursing home to see Dad tonight. He seemed quite happy. He loves chatting people up, but can get a little irritating to some as he can seem overbearing. He definitely seemed to be having a good time. They had his bracelet on him that buzzes in nursing station if he gets near an open door. Otherwise he has free range, and he ranges freely. The nurses can't keep up. When they call to ask if there's anything in particular he likes to do, because he's such a livewire, I will tell them, give him a spade and send him out to the fenced in recreation area, he'll have the soil all turned for a garden, come spring. So, I feel more comfortable now that I see he is adjusting well. I'm going to hang back on the visits for a bit b/c he seems to be adjusting just fine, but being as he's my Dad, when he sees me he thinks ""responsibility"". Like he's got to figure out how to take care of me. I guess you never stop being a parent, if you are a parent. I have my youngest son here right now. He was in the city, working really hard, and developed a hernia. I don't think he took enough time off from work and his boss was driving him. He quit. He has been very helpful re.: driving mearound, running errands and such. It's a family effort.


 Hey, Tyno here. It wasn't exactly peaceful, I'm still settling my Dad's estate issues, we have to sell the farm. That's the business I'm in presently. Sorting, separating stuff, selling some, hoarding some, the place is run down, damp, cold and nasty, but they were packrats and I don't know what to do with a lot of it. However, I'll just keep chipping away at it. the gentleman who is interested in buying the farm, says I can continue picking away at it for an additional few months. It's odd. Anyway, tomorrow, i drive my son to the closest town to visit some friends. I'll be alone here with just the dogs. I will be fine. Thank-you


 I have been depressed over having to go and get all the stuff out of mom and dad's house this wknd I am glad your dad is happy but he will be a bit overbearing at first Tale care of you I will be on tomorrow morning Luvs LYN


 I cn believe the things you are going thru IT literally ripped my heart out The house has been sold IT is like all of Mom and Dad is gone from the Earth............ BUT I do have great memories........... Take care of you plz


 Thank-you, Howlyncat. The going into the house and selling stuff is temporarily in the hands of my very kind and competent neighbor who lives three houses up. I was trying to get ahead of day before yesterday's predicted snowstorm for the afternoon, and thought I could light a fire, feed the cats, and look for some missing pieces. Like a box of Dominoes with one tile missing. Not good, As I was shortcutting through a dirt road that shaves about 15 KMs. Off the drive, just as I was cresting a hill, there was this hugh, loaded down logging truck coming straight at me. I swerved to avoid him and found myself in an eight ft. ditch. So I threw in the towel called a tow truck and got the car pulled out, but then it began making this high pitched squealing noise. I headed straight home. Parked in driveway, went out yesterday to clear snow off car cause I had errands, and found the car would turn over quite nicely, but wouldn't move. Something was seriously wrong. Called my new best friend, the tow truck fellow, bless you Paul, and he towed car to mechanic. After waiting around all day, except for running down the road a kilo for milk, I got The Call. Yikes. No longer an All Wheel Drive, the entire back end fell off. Now they can get it running for time being as front wheel drive, only. Gonna stay off those back roads for the remainder of winter. Going to buy a van conversion and move to Tofina. Let those other two slackers field the calls, Dad needs such and such, Stepmom needs to be driven 200 miles for an xray. Sorry this line is no longer in service, no forwarding address.


 TYNO Come here anytime and vent you do need to do that I know I did so many times I also have fibro and just fell the other day and due to prednisone I am on (I believe it makes our bones more brittle) I now am in a foot or walking cast......... I know the pain of fibro and hun you have to try and get some rest and try to get some relief ARE you on any meds to help with the pain You have to be in shape to have your dad and looking after him I so am proud of you and your continual suport of your dad no matter what he does Take care and email me if you want k U and him are in my heart thoughts and prayers Luvs LYN


 I am glad you got him closer and that you are going for a rest my friend YOU need it with all that you have been dealt IMHO I also tell my doc if I take an extra Pain med and he will add a PRN to my RX for me I dont do it often but sometimes the pain is too much to handle as you are well aware Luvs and take care you LYN


 AS you know I am in Ontario I am so blessed to have a doc that will not let me be in pain ' I am on Oxycontin 40 mgs 3 times a day and percocets for B/T pain I was on 60 mgs of morphine 4 times daily with a 10 mg Instant release.........but they had to recall the morphine and I tried the new ones they had and was so sick I could not get out of bed ........did nothing for the pain Could you not talk to doc again and explain this is not helping you at all ...... Keep me posted plz Luvs LYN


 hi....just hoping you are having a peaceful day.......


 tyno, if not peace, perhaps you'll find balance....thinking of you lynnie


 Dear Lyn: you're not going to believe this, but I am doing exactly the same thing, have been for two weeks, probably have another two weeks ahead. I can only do about one hour at a time, I have to wear a mask cause of the mould and deteriorating fibreglass. Then i have to market the stuff to make money to bridge the time owing for Dad's care at the nursing home. Because he was an emergency placement. I hope they're patient with me because he was left with hugh bills accrued by my stepmom, and now I'm left with hugh bills for both he and his wife. I don't enjoy bartering. I do have a buyer, for the house and property, I just have to wait till he's back from vacation. It really is a most depressing task.


 I've been clearing out my Mum's house as well, it is a depressing thing to do. It's hard enough when someone has died but doubly hard when you feel you are intruding and shouldn't really be doing it, and you're frightened to throw things out that 'she might want'. My house is gradually filling up with things from my childhood, photographs, pictures and ornaments etc. And that's before I decide what to do with the furniture. I can't sell the house as the market has collapsed, and it's in poor condition so I'm not sure I can rent it out in its current state. And I can't spend Mum's money on it because that is 'willful deprivation of assets' and not allowed. I can't spend my money on it because if we have to sell it I won't get anything back and all the money could go on care. I can't decide what to do but in the meantime the house needs emptied so every day I go and spend a couple of hours there moving stuff around and salvaging lots of memories. Erin"
Swallowing difficulty,Over the past month my partner has been gagging and coughing when she is eating or taking her meds....it seems to be getting graduallly worse.... is there something i could be doing to make it easier for her? is she forgetting how to swallow? this really scares me.... lynnie,"hi.....yes, some of her medication can be crushed and some can't.... i appreciate the advice on the thick it, i will pick some of it up tomorrow....i've been making her smoothies and milkshakes but there's only so many things she likes.... as far as her lungs, she spent a couple weeks in the hospital around christmas time with pneumonia and then was home for only a few days and suffered a collapsed lung and was hospitalized again... it seems as though she is going downhill at a more rapid pace now.....


 SnowyLynne, thanks so much for the advice the thick-it is working great......she's not wanting to eat much but at least it is going down easier.... Lyn...thank you as well....I did get with her dr. and found out what meds i could crush up....he talked with me about tpn for nutrition if things get really bad, but for now we are doing ok..... well except for sleep....her sleep pattern is so messed up and i'm up all hours of the night with her......she sleeps well for a few hours and then she's up and so am i........ (another) lynn ie


 Can you crush her meds? Try a thickener in drinks & some foods.Thick It is the name......Coughing while eating she can aspirate her food & get Pnuemonia......Yes the do forget to swallow...... Does she have lung problems?


 As Was said yes they can and do sometimes forget t swallow I would try crushing and doing as what snowy said to try and see if that helps If not you may have to speak with the doc about other alternative ways of having meds as wel as nutrients getting into her properly Keep me posted' I will be on the ad forum alot more 'LYN


 Lynnie771,hi. Sometimes their mouth gets to dry,if are small pills use apple sauce.Just take a spoon of applesauce and put the pill on top. For food mostly will be puree`(sorry don`t know in english),all food must be puree`(smashed like a smashed potato). But the best way to exercise the swelling(swolling)is to let your love one drink fluids through a straw,it makes the muscles around the throat stronger. If you can buy a baby cup,the one with the little three holes with both handles(plastic one)drinking water from that type of cup makes the tongue muscles stronger. One more exercise to tuffer the throat is making them singing like the opera does,aaaa aaaa,I`m not joking,I did that to my best friend when she had the same problem for different reasons at that time. I wish you good luck and be strong. I hope you don`t mind if I answered you since I am new. Today was my first day of knowing this disease,my best friend she got sick of alzheimer's too but all the tricks I told you were tricks that I learned in ten years of enjoyable and painful friendship with her,painful I mean back and for to the hospitals for different reason all the times,now I got a new one. Good luck again Lynnie771"
Ativan and AD,Good Morning Everyone - Could you please share with me why Ativan and AD is a bad mix - My hubby has suffered from Lyme Disease since 95 and in 2007 was put on Ativan for anxiety and panic attacks. Any help and all opinions is so appreciated.,"Ativan is in the Benzo family not good for AD or any dementia....


 Hi Hope, I don't know the answer to your questions . . .but have seen info posted here in the past. This is a search of this website for Ativan and Alz. Maybe you can find your answer here. https://www.healingwell.com/sitesearch.aspx?cx=010904608862850737972%3Abe-6h9dblc4&q=ativan+alz&sa=Search+Site&cof=FORID%3A9#1057 I hope this helps. Blessings!


 IMHO and in studies done NO ativan is NOT a good med for Alzheimer's at all Benzo's can/ do make ppl worse wih this DD There are other alternative meds out there 'PLZ check into them and keep us posted God Bless LYN"
Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome ( 4S also called),"Has anyone encountered this syndrome ? Basically , certain sounds almost are unbearable to the individual. There seems to be no cure for it. So far 16 doctors & specialists have not been able to help.There is a web site for it but so far none of the people that suffer with it have been able to get any help. Looking forward to any replies Thank you.","Thank you for your response. I will check into what was suggested. Thanks again Razzle


 Have you looked into a condition called Hyperacusis? Sinus allergies can irritate the inner ear and distort how sound is perceived - I have some first hand experience with this. Also, might look into Lyme Disease - it can cause hypersensitivity to sounds. Make sure to see a Lyme-Literate doctor for testing, since most non-Lyme-Literate MD's aren't familiar with the shortcommings of the tests. The Lyme Disease forum here at HealingWell has a number of knowledgeable folks to ask if you have further questions about Lyme. A skilled Homeopathic Physician may also be able to help with this symptom...be aware that some but not all Naturopathic Physicians are skilled with Homeopathics, so be sure to ask specifically about the person's experience with Homeopathic treatment. Good luck,

no urination/no bowel movements,Father is in end stage of alzheimers. He no longer has bowel movements and has a cathater because he is not urinating.

 I'm so sorry to hear this :( It sounds like it could be that his body is shutting down or it can be from other things as well such as old age related physical ailements - bad prostate, bowel obstruction, medication related constipation etc. I wished I could be more help but I just want to send you ((hugs)) and let you know that we are thinking about you, your family and your poor father."
Sometimes You Need to Go to Their World .........,"It's true, we have to go to their world so they could feel our presence, support and sympathy. Have a reminiscense of our happy memories, when we were a child playing with them, wonderful events, like birthdays, receiving awards in school, graduations,w eddings... all of these might bring happiness with them...Play the music, their old favorite songs, sing with them, who knows these memories are still in the corner of their mind and heart. only they could not express it. But if you will observe their reaction you will notice a sparkle in their eyes, a shining in their smile, that mean to say, they're with us at that moment.We touch their heart. The memories are still there...only you need to go to their world.","Go to their world... This is a story of one of our resident in our facilty for more tahn six years. A husband, he moved in when he was in the middle stage of the disease. We witnessed the progression of the disease until to the end stage when he expired. The wife since the day her husband moved in, you can count on your finger the days that she wasn't here to see her husband. She's talking to him, talling stories about their love and marriage, she's feeding him. Although she's not getting any respond fron her husband, she keeps on doing this.Until one time, to her surprised, while the wife was holding his hand, the husband kissed her hand. The wife hug him tightly and we saw there was a tears in the eyes of his husband. As the wife said, "" I know he's still here. And I want him to feel that he is being love, that I'm here beside him. I wan't him to feel my presence."" And every 5 pm that she says goodbye, although the husband was not saying a word, you can see the loneliness in his face. They're not talking, but you can see in their face if they are lonely, if they are angry or if they are happy. Memory is lost but not their instinct as a human being who need to be loved and cherissed.


 I am very emotional today and this story has brought me to tears Thanks again for posting I did so much of this with Mom before she passed and continue to do it with DAD They are still "" in there"" .................. LYN

 You have to go to their world to know exactly what they need and what they want.And I want to post a questiion, what do most Alzheimer's patient want, objective, desire as a whole?


 Those that are not constantly or even occasionally around Dad DO NOT get this at all I was told off this past wknd for "" lying"" to him.......... I was not lying I was going with him to a PLACE he wanted and needed to go ..his memories ....I went with him I am so disappointed in the whole Thankgsgiving family thing altogether and will not put another family function together ...I tried I tried so bloody hard BUT to no avail ...they are back living in there fantasy worlds thinking ""ach"" she is nuts nothing wrong with him lol They all PRETEND he is okay ........Maybe they HAVE to do that ....whatever but dont be down on me all the time when I am the only one other than ( now my younger brother) that SEES what I deal with daily as he has been looking after Dad ( and I will add when he first saw him since Mom's Memorial he was in SHOCK and had to leave as he was crying) mostly except when Cait not working or at School ........then she takes dad on walks to feed the geese and see the sunfish in the pond ......I am glad we are making the memories .........


 Lyn, I have been reading these posts and I have a question. Sometimes Gma will ""make up"" stories but really it's a twist on her reality. What is the right thing to do? Do I go with it or try to correct some of the ""twists""? Do they get agitated when they are corrected? Normally Gma looks to me to supply her answers to certain things - so I'm not sure if this would be one of those times.


 Thanks Lyn. Yeah, Gma never gets angry with me for nothing! She is such a sweetheart to me. I just wasn't sure I was enabling her with her ""delusions"". So it's best to try to keep them grounded in the reality then? I have to say though that some of her stories are quite entertaining! lol


 Wow, Jeannie........that is awesome


 Important info IMHO LYN


 To the top for newer members


 NO I am not saying Blatantly Lie to them at all but I am saying that sometimes for their sake and piece of mind you need to go into their world with them Listen to them and agree with them not argue as that will not work IMHO THey still may have thoughts and memories of the past it wont hurt you to go with them as long as IT WONT HURT THEM Take them thru old photos down memory lane and such let them know you do know and empathize with them ......... I am sure more have ideas to post God Bless Our Seniors and Caregivers


 I do see that sparkle with Dad when I play "" Jonnie Ray"" or the old Big Bands "" Dad use to love to drum and he was good at it he still drums away lightly with fingers and to perfect BEAT whena song comes on he especially loves Thanks MM for your input


 Thanks MM That is so true and thanks for sharing this story Lyn


 Sometimes you Need to Go to Their World This is one of my favorite posting...why? Because I'm one of them. I know exactly who they are and what they need. Everyday is a struggle for me. I'm still working full time to residential care facility for the elderly to support my children. I have two teens who depends on me. I""m not ready to lose my job so I have to prove to my employer that I'm still worthwhile to the company. So I give my best in my job. I belong to the residents. Sixteen years of Parkinsons is no joke. I know the agony and misery of being sick. So I sing with them. We play cards, we do exercise, arts and crafts, I really spend my time with them. Some of them are really out of reality, but still they deserve to be loved. It certainly gives a happy feeling when you see them smiling. They know that they are being love when you hold their hands, when you comb their hair, pat their shoulders, or give the a little massage. They can not communicate but they can express their feelings thru their senses. Go to their world to share your feeling with them. Share your happiness, your blessings and most of all...YOUR LOVE.


 Be thankful for the difficult times...during those times we grow. I love this quotation and you can adapt it to our daily living. It's hard to be sick, physically. emotionally, financially, the whole family is affected. If you are one sided and see anly the negative side, you will be depressed. It's difficult everyday is a struggle. But I look at this difficulties as a challenge. Difficult times make you a strong person. The more I'm determined to win the battle against Parkinson's Disease. Difficult times is my inspiration to strive more for the better. I don't stop researching how to delay the progression of PD. And I'm winning everyday. I don't let my PD to be an obstacle in enjoying a normal life. As if I'm not sick. I keep on walking even my feet are twisting. Then after several steps I will notice that I'm already wallking straight. From crooked to straight because of your will to walk. Difficult times develop my courage and determination to succeed. I know you can do it too.


 Going to their world isnt always easy BUT it is a needed in very many cases and in times Please just love them revere ,them respect and care for them as you would want to be cared for LYN


 I really believe they do and to have knowledge that they are revered and respected .............not forgotten and locked away


 Bringing to top for Irishman


 Red...it would really depend on where she goes with her Fantasies .IF it it something that you can bring her back to WHAT really happened on a certain day by saying something like .""Oh GMA I remember this and this happening on that day too can you ...... or you can take her and go with the reality she perceives as long as it is not way out there.. I will go with much of what dad says BUT I do remind him or correct him on some things ..I find he does not get aggitated with me or cait but will with others I am sure you can find ways to work around this by trying lil things at a time .or if she does get WAY out there tell her 'No GMA it happened this way .as far as I remember....... The reason we have to sometimes go to their worl is that they have reverted back in time and they always dont have the days and times together or right ..places and ppl get confused in their minds .....and sometimes it is so much easier to agree and go with it as long as it not hurtful to you or family members or GMA ....... I wish you all the best and give her a big Huggle for me k Take care of you too I do so admire you for all you are doing ..there are not many anymore that will have parents or loved ones in their homes as it is a very hard job at times and can be frustrating as well especially when the caregiver is sick as you are ........Be well my friend and let me know if this helps .....LYN


 Sometimes you can use the delusions to help them, too. When I was in college I spent my summers working at a nursing home and many of the residents had what we now know is Alzheimers. I remember one lady in particular who had some of her nice furniture in her room and we dressed her in nice dresses with earrings and makeup every day. She could no longer take interest in feeding herself so I was usually assigned to feed her. I was a dumb kid with no real training but I did my best. She used to refuse her meals and say she wanted to go out to eat. So I'd walk out of the room with the tray and then come back in. I'd put down the tray and ask her if she liked this place to eat. I'd tuck in her napkin, ask her if she cared for coffee and then give her a sip. In no time at all she would be eating her meal and telling me how good the service was here and how we should come back again. She called me by her sister's name (who was long dead) and said to be sure to leave a big tip. She enjoyed those 'out to eat' lunches with her 'sister' and she ate every bite. If I would have corrected her and brought her back to the here and now she would have been saddened to remember her sister was dead and she was going to end her days in this little room. I was all too happy to let her have her fantasy...


 Yes and such a GREAT way to go about it Yes it is good to try and keep them in some semblance of reality BUT it is definitely okay to go with them to their world and my dad sure has some interesting tales to tell ......he is such a teddy bear ...... Thanks Jeannie I appreciate your input ..........For a "" dumb kid"" you did Dang well I would say ..Many nurses with yrs of training would not have thought of that one Kudos to you Input always appreciated ..........Luvs LYN


 ...........Even as the end was coming and the machines were being taken off I still went with dad on his journey to meet his Maker and be with Mom God How I miss them so.................. Cherish your parents please


 I agree 100%!"
"The ""not-so-common"" symptoms","I was hoping people out there could help me understand this more. My father has not yet been diagnosed with Alzheimers, but has many of the classic symptoms: short term memory loss, he repeats himself, gets lost in familiar neighborhoods, excessive sleeping, etc. He is 80 years old. However, there are other symptoms and I don't know if there are indicative of alzheimers or not. He no longer has the ability to have ""normal"" conversations, he has become socially inappropriate, he says the same set of inappropriate comments or jokes incessantly, his repetoire of conversational comments is limited, and what he does day is inappropriate. He will speak to every stranger he comes across, and make the same inappropriate comments. He thinks he's funny, and no matter how many times we plead with him not to make personal comments about people, he can't seem to help it. Help me understand this.","He's on medication but not for dementia. He doesn't believe there is a problem and is quite sharp in other areas (i.e. stock market). He lives in his home with my mother and at 80, he looks about 65, so instead of people being forgiving to an elderly man with dementia, they view him as ""a dirty old man"" who knows exactly what he's saying. Even his doctor is annoyed and impatient with him. I'd like to point out to people that his behavior is symptomatic, but there is very little information out there on this symptom.


 Loss of executive function can be a sign of dementia, stroke or other difuse brain damage. He should be seen by a good doctor (neurologist) for a diagnosis. Then if it is dementia the anticholinestrases may be of benefit for the short term.


 I would have him tested by a Nuerologist get him on meds.for dementia & pray he does better.Puts me in mind of Front temporal Dementia...


 Does your father take any medication to slow the progression of his dementia? If not, maybe starting him on some may help ""control"" some of these outbursts. Your father doesn't know what he is doing and telling him to stop will not help. People with dementia can lose their inhibitions and may do some inappropriate things. Does he still live at home or in a center?


 Does your mom notice a change in him? Can she get him to start medication?


 Everyone is different at different levels of dementia.No 2 are alike......


 I have to definitely agree with Snowy...he needs to be seen by a neuro....also that no 2 are alike my mom and dad both suffered with ad and are both gone now their sx and dd were very different..there was naturally a couple of simularities but......the course time frame and behaviour s were nothing alike.Let us know how you make out plz.........lyn"
Early Onset AD,Has anyone been diagnosed with early onset AD and stayed pretty much the same... Husband is just 50 years old and was diagnosed with Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease in 2003. Neuro lyme disease has some of the smae memory issues that AD has - Just wondering....any help or yout thoughts would really be appreciated. HopeFloats,"Red_34 Doc never mentioned plaque deposits - on reports that we received it did say that all findings were conflicting for a diagnosis of AD. But doc says that is what it is. My husband has on several ocassions had a spinal tap and has tested positive in his spinal fluid for lyme disease. We know that it is neurological lyme. I am not 100% convinced that it is AD - this doctor will not eve talk about lyme. He is very closed minded about this - what do you all think....... HopeFloats


 Hi SnowyLynne He is a neuro - has nos bedside manner at all and will not even consider that the lyme is causing these probelms. Husband's lyme went undiagnosed for almost 8 years before he received the right treatment. It had a good long time to do damage. I think a second opinion is a good idea.


 I'm new to this forum. I'm 46 and have been diagnosed with EOAD. I've been on Namenda and Aricept for almost two years now and Lamictal for epilepsy for almost 2 1/2 years. Anybody out there who can tell me whether I'll have to keep taking the Nam and Ari for ever or whether the medication is only effective for a certain period of time? Thanks


 Thank you for the kind words. I feel fine.


 I wish I had Lyme disease. That may sound odd so let me clarify. My neuro has searched high and low and found nothing of the kind (I asked her to do so after reading some of your postings, for which I thank you). She was understanding, but concluded that my eoad is the correct diagnosis and not related to anything but a dying brain. It sounds weird to say that and to know that your alarm clock is ticking but you don't know the when its set to go off. I have frontal lobe dysfunction (which I understand is the reason I am euphoric as opposed to depressed), but in the midst of euphoria, I get frustrated, especially on the good days (like today) when I feel like my old self. On the bad days, I just feel plain stupid and I become agitated, which is difficult for my wife and kids. I'm glad you were able to find the cause of your 'dementia'. You are very lucky and I wish you the best. Sorry to be long-winded. I guess I just wanted to vent.


 Hope ask your primary Dr to test you for Lyme..........


 Ask for him to be treated,it's way past time..........Drs can be so stupid at times......


 There are many younger people who have AD in thier mid 30's..........


 He has gone to 3 or 4 doctors who have confirmed that he does indeed have Chronic Neuro Lyme Disease. He has had numerous spinal taps and it does continually present itself in is spinal fluid. He has only gone to one neurologist and gotten the AD diagnosis. This doctor has never accepted the fact that Jimmy has Chronic Lyme - one of the most common problems with neuro lyme is cognitive and memory issues among many other issues. His Lyme initially went untreated for 7 years. If he does have AD I can accpet that and in some ways it makes me love him even more. I will always be here to take care of him.


 Thanks Red_34 - He is the best husband in the world....


 AD is unpredictable. It can remain mild while slowly progressing over the years or it can be mild and severe in a blink of an eye. Has your husband ever had testing done to see if it's Alzheimers such as brain scans? If so, does he have plaque deposits on his brain? Also, if he had the scans, does the Lyme disease show up? <-I am not that familiar with Lyme.


 Is this your main Dr or Neuro? Get another opinion from a diff.Dr...... Lyme disease can cause many problems...........


 I agree that you need to find another doctor that is a bit more open minded. I really don't know much about Lyme but it seems to me that, as in every aspect of our lives, that we need to be advocates not only for ourselves but for our loved ones as well.


 Hi, welcome to Healingwell Alexander :) No one can predict the outcome of AD. It can progress rapidly or slowly. However, the medications designed for AD are meant to slow down the progression. Usually these meds are taken long term to slow it down as much as possible until (maybe) they stop working all together. But I hope for your sake that they help for many years to come!


 Just by chance I happened to see this topic. I've had Lyme - probably for a very long time. I've had problems with fatigue, malaise, anxiety, depression and cognitive problems. Recently I had a neuropsychological exam. We had the follow up meeting but the final report isn't out yet. The neuropsychologist has a year post-doc work in the roles different parts of the brain play in cognition. I had about 7 hrs of testing. They do all kinds of tests to check out all facets of memory, concentration, attention, etc. I'm wondering if you can get a referral for a neuropsych exam. I believe AD looks very much different than the problems from Lyme on the neuropsych test. I think it would give you a lot of insight into what is really going on. I thought I was having memory problems and of course can't multi-task. The tests showed that the underlying problems were different than I thought. I have a major deficit in processing speed and also in problem solving. There was some other stuff but anyways, there are many things still that weren't affected by the Lyme. See if you can get a referral. It is expensive testing. My insurance considered the neuropsych exam a medical procedure and not a psychological test. So it was covered. Oh yeah .... all those tests made for a very long day.


 By the way, if I haven't said it before, I'll say it now: I'm grateful for this forum. It is comforting to be able to voice (even though in writing) one's frustrations without being judged or feeling guilty about having a problem that others (siblings, for example) can't quite grasp is real and difficult to handle. Thanks.


 Hi SnowyLynne My husband Jimmy was tested for Lyme Disease - he was initially bit in 95 - doc said then that it was a spider bite - he was bit a second time in 02 and was diagnosed at that time to have lyme. Since then we have found out that he also has erlichiosis, bartonella and Q fever - all co-infections of lyme disease - I truly believe his cognitive and memory issues are from lyme due to the fact that it went untreated for 7 years - that's a lot of time to imbed itself in a body and to do harm - what do you think ???


 Hi Again SnowyLynne He has been treated with antiobiotics and IV antibiotics on and off for years - he feels better when he is on them but they can certainly take their toll on the body for sure - his stomach is a constant mess - that is why I wonder about the diagnosis of AD - his neuro has never quite accepted the idea that Jimmy suffers from chronic neurological lyme disease - maybe I am in denial about the AD probably because he is so young and we have 2 young children - life can sure suck somtimes ..........


 Alexander, you are more then welcome to come here anytime and share your feelings. We understand what it's like to either have this horrible condition or knows someone who does. I do not have it but I seen my grandmother decline rather quickly and it was and is breaking my heart. So you are among friends now. Hope, Lynne is right. It is not unheard of that AD can be diagnosed in people who are in their 30's but this is very out of the ordinary. I think the typical age range is 60+ to be diagnosed. But follow your instincts. If you feel that it is not AD but rather Lyme then persue it. Have you ever taken him to see another doctor?


 Aww Hope that is just so thoughtful, kind and loving thing to do for your husband. You must love him very much. He is lucky to have you by his side. If the 3 or 4 docs say one thing and only ONE doc says another, I would stick to what the other 3/4 had said.


 Think I'd get a different Neuro......And take his Lyme dx with you......"
Any tips for Motivating An Alzheimers Patient?,"Hi... my mother is disabled. She suffers from memory issues and gets very fatigued quickly. I am her primary caregiver and make sure that her needs are met. I wish she would do more than just lay around on the couch watching daytime tv. Which is pretty much what she does during the day. I will give her a list of tasks/chores for her to do during the day. I tape reminders up all over the house for her to complete these tasks, as well as whats in the fridge to eat, or any other notice I think she would benefit from seeing constantly. The problem is that she doesn't have any motivation. Sometimes she doesn't do anything all day and just lays around. There's nothing wrong with that, but it would be nice if I could get her to develop a hobby or start some kind of project. Something that will engage her to think in a different way. Has anybody else experienced this? Can anybody give me any (out-of-the-box) tips for getting her motivated?","Hi Moon . . . Welcome to the forum. I see Red already gave you some really insightful info. I'm not sure how far gone your mom is. She may also be depressed. Does she enjoy doing anything when you are doing it together? One good activity for the brain and the body is walking. If she'll take a walk with you to a nearby friend or store . . . or around the block, it can improve mood, stamina, and general health, as well as getting oxygen to the brain to slow progression of this dd. If you discuss this with her doc and the doc determines that there is depression involved, there are meds that can really help with that too. Glad you found us. Blessings!


 Is your mother suffering from AD or dementia? If so, this can account for her lack of motivation. My gma lost all motivation as well so I would have to sit down with her and we would do crafts together. That was quite the challenge considering my gma is almost blind! :) Your mother may need someone to do things with her to get her moving again. If she has dementia or AD then she may NOT be able to start things herself. That is where you or your family comes in. I feel it's important to keep their minds working for as long as possible to help with their mind. I sometimes would play word games with my gma and she looked forward to those games. These word games were actually kids games but my gma seemed to like them. What sort of disability does your mother have?


 Another great thing I and my parents did were Collages If you can find lotsa family pics and get them together and paste them on a big pice of Bristol board It makes for a great family pic or pics IMHO Going out and collecting leaves or if you have snow already .//well thats out lol There are so many things My other thing to do was big puzzles with parents Keeping what they had in their brain still functioning ya know Glad you are here.........LYN GREAT INPUT ALL"
I wonder if I suffer from Alzheimer's Disease/Dimentia...,"Greetings all, I'm Paulos, from the anxiety forum. I'm on xanax/zoloft medications just wanted to put that on the table, and never been real bright with schoolwork and scholar ways, also I'm a 23 year old autistic male, I was just wondering maybe I have Alzheimer's Disease/Dimentia... I mean once I think of trying to learn things, reading books, or watching documentaries ... I realize I just FORGET it all after I do it, it's pathetic and horrific, am I doomed, and is my age making me stupider? In the long run, I'm just feeling stupid, dumb in the head, unable to extract/type proper words/wording and just ... speak intelligently in my opinion, lots of people say I'm hard on myself but ... I don't know, I say I am no longer at my peak from my past, but was I ever smart is my question, maybe I was in an ignorant bliss thinking I was smart in 2004, until the alcohol started in 2005... bah I feel like smacking myself.","But I know I'm going to be alone someday, not being able to pay bills and ... taking care of a house, the world scares me, my old alcoholism it's like ... I just know I'm gonna be put in a home :(


 Could be ADHD too or ADD..............Talk to your Dr......


 PAULOS: As sad as I felt reading your notes, I feel you have tremendous insight into what may be causing these alarming lapses in memory, low feelings of self worth, sadness and fear. I believe you have named the three or four things causing your feelings of despair and if I'm right in any way the good news for you is that there is hope. You mention Xanax (tranquilizer and addictive), Zoloft (anti-depressant with many side effects, not to be mixed with alcohol), Darvon (narcotic and addictive), alcohol (central nervous system depressant and addictive). Each of these substances in your body, even one of them, causes mood changes and often, disordered thinking. The combination of all four is most likely causing the extreme difficulties and symptoms you describe: memory loss, depression, feelings of low self worth, thought disorders (confusion) and fear. Three of these substances are addictive and if you are an addictive personality, it is highly possible you may be addicted and need immediate help. The good news is that there is help and if you are willing to do anything to get better, and you will get better if you get the help you need to come off these drugs, then go for it. I recommend you ask your doctor for help, find some AA - Alcoholics Anonymous - meetings where you can meet other young people just like yourself who will support you and share with you how they have come off these addictive and debilitating substances, one day at a time. I do not suggest coming off Zoloft - that is something you and your doctor can decide later when these other substances, alcohol, narcotics and tranquilzers are out of your system. There is a way out and better way to live Paulos. Try picking up the telephone and calling AA in your community for help. Also, Paulos you are at high risk of dying from combining these very toxic chemicals in your body. So please reach out, ask you Higher Power, God, or whomever you pray to for help. Help will come. It is on its way to you now. You can do it. Life will become desirable over these toxic substances ruining your will. This too shall pass. Blessings to you.


 Paulos, no I highly doubt you have dementia or Alzheimers. There can be so many reason why you are not retaining what you learn. My husband is the SAME way. Truthfully I think he has ADD. It seems to me that you are not ""hard wired"" to learn as easily as everyone else but do NOT let this upset you. Everyone has obstacles they have to hurdle and this is one of yours. It CAN be done. I know a couple of autistic people so to even be able to type your post is one of those hurdles and you did terrific! You are NOT dumb! In fact, just by reading your post, it seems the opposite. You seem to me a very intelligent young man.


 You can't worry about ""some day"". You have to live in the now and try to enjoy the good things in life instead of worrying about what may or may not happen. This is a tough philosphy to learn and trust me, I didn't think I would ever feel that way when I was your age. But now that I am older I can sit back realize that things we worry about TODAY will have no significance in the FUTURE. And if it our TODAY affects our FUTURE then there is nothing we can do about it anyway but go forward and try to change the way the future will come and how we handle it. Does that make any sense?


 Sure could Lynne! :) It could also be a form of Dyslexia. Dyslexia takes several forms and retaining what you learn is another form."
Question about my father,"Hello everyone, I'm newby to this forum & would like some advice about my father who is 76 years old (I am his daughter, aged 30). I'll tell you the story as briefly as I can. During November, he passed a flu after which he began having chest and bone pains. We went to the hospital 3 times, visited his cardiologist many many times, made a lot of tests, everything was found to be normal. His heart is ok (NB: he had a heart attack 12 years ago & had an open heart surgery & never had problems of that kind ever since). Since November, he changed a lot : he seems to be panicking about all kinds of things, can't sleep well, complains about hot flashes, he is hyperactive (cannot sit just about anywhere) & is extremely nervous and insecure. Additionally, he cannot stand heat sources (fireplace, sun, stove). The thyroid test was negative. His physician now prescribed him a medicine called ""Ebixa 10"" which alleviates the Alzheimer disease's symptoms. My father has not been diagnosed with Alzheimer, so when I asked the doctor why he gave him that medicine, he answered that my father might be at the 1st stage of this disease & that this medicine will help his brain work better. I must also tell you that he seems to have developed some phobias, for example he avoids some foods because of the fear of choking. My mother is very concerned & I'm really worrying about them both. If you have experience with situations like the one described above or if you are a healthcare professional, please do give me some advice. Could my father be suffering from the Alzheimer disease? What can we do to make him feel better? Is there anything else we should perhaps check? Thank you!","So he was never like this before having the flu? Did he ever do things before that was a bit odd? Did he have a fever with the flu? What kind of doctor presribed the AD med?


 He needs to be seen by a neurologist to rule out other problems first. They will make sure there is nothing else wrong with his brain. But they will have him do a series of cognitive and logic tests and make the determination if he has AD after the testing.


 My mom was diagnosed 7 years ago with AD, and she saw a neuropsychologist or neuropsychiatrist who did a series of tests, as mentioned above and also interviewed my mom, well that was part of the evaluation. My mom also had an MRI and in addition, bloodwork to rule out other diseases. Her diagnosis is ""probable"" Alzheimer's because a definitive diagnosis cannot be made until autopsy, when the brain is looked at for ""placques and tangles""...there is a wealth of information on the Internet that you might want to Google. Just as an FYI, two weeks ago, she began having TIA's, ""mini strokes"" and after 3 days in the hospital and every imaginable test, we learned that they were been caused my medication. She was taking Sudafed, which can cause strokes in people with high blood pressure. You need to find out what medicaitons uour dad is taking, including over the counter drugs and supplements. Best of luck, Miriam


 you may find this product like most drugs causes reactions and your dad could be having one or more Your doctor has prescribed a drug for moderate to severe alzheimers. * tiredness, sleepiness, sleeplessness, or problems sleeping * dizziness * diarrhoea, vomiting, or nausea * loss of appetite * feeling anxious * conjunctivitis. These are mild side effects of the medicine.


 Please keep us updated ok Ypatia?


 Hello again & thank you very much for giving me ideas and hope. I will keep you updated as soon as I can.


 What about anemia?Is his Dr primary care or Neurologist??


 Hello again & thank you both for your replies. His doctor (and the one who prescribed Ebixa 10) is a general practitioner. My father has done many blood tests & none has shown anemia. He did not have fever with the flu & before that he was ok. A strange thing but also very important that I forgot to mention yesterday is that he has lost weight, about 9 kilos. Does anyone know how the Alzheimer's is diagnosed?


 Your response is very precise & helpful. Thank you!


 Thank you very much for the information. I don't know much about this disease, will certainly make a research over the Internet. But we don't know yet whether he has this disease, there's only a suspicion. Now we 're waiting for the results from some other tests and then we will visit a neurologist. Thank you & good luck to you too!


 Hello there and thank you very much for your reply and for the information provided. He seems to be responding well to Ebixa 10 and he's also taking Lexotanil for a while. Not any side effects have been noticed. He is about to be seen by a neurologist. I'll keep my fingers crossed so he doens't have Alzheimer's.


 ypatia good luck with the neurologist and i hope he hasnt got alzheimers. With the weight loss .Look at what food he is having a phobia on and try giving him food instead with a high calorie content. can any one correct me would it be the corret thing to do. do we have any nutrition experts here??"
Not taking her medication,"Hi all, My mom has become very difficult in swallowing her pills. She has the ability to swallow glasses of water while keeping the medicine in her mouth. She always lets it melt in her mouth and in the end chews them up before finally swallowing them. I am totally exhausted in trying to make her understand that she needs to take them whole since they are combo drug so it can't be split up in order for them to work effectively. One of the meds has an orange coloring or that's always the tip off. Her tongue and mouth ends up bright orange and the bitter taste doesn't seem to bother in in the least. I get so angry that I just yell and yell and make her gulp down the water. I asked her doctor to prescribe liquid forms of the meds but she said they are not available and also even if they were she thinks by giving them liquid the dosage will never be right because you serve it on a spoon where you can always have too much or too little. She had suggested I have her take the medicine with apple sauce but that's pretty amateur for my mom. She just swallows the applesauce and still keep the pills in. She never reveals that they are still in her mouth. She has an excellent way to hide them behind her gum or under her tongue so when you tell her open her mouth it looks like it's empty. Whenever I ask where is the medicine she will give a smart alack answer of ""at the pharmacy"" Please help. Any suggestions?","Parkinson medication - Stalevo & Mirapex Alzheimer medication - Namenda High Blood Pressure medication - Norvasc Trigleceride medication - Tricor The only ones she has problems swallowing has been Stalevo and Tricor. They are both quite large and even though I break apart Tricor for her she still does not swallow it. Stalevo must be swallowed as one pill because it contains 3 meds in one. I always wondered why pharmaceutical companies make certain pills so BIG. Who on earth can swallow them? I threw out my nature made fish oil supplement after getting it stuck in my throat on more than one occasion.


 I'm surprised she's not on Aricep,or Galentimine along with the Namenda,as that's how it is usually done.....


 They make adult rubber underpants that have a tighter elastic band. They're kind of hard to find though. But if you can find them, put them over her store brand diapers. It might help keep things from leaking. As for the pills, I am still thinking on that one but if I come up with an idea I will let you know! LOL


 Thanks, I'll go this weekend and check it out.


 Myrio thanks for the suggestion and welcome to Healingwell btw! This works for a lot of medications but some of the meds that Bella's mother is on is more or less time released and crushing them is not an option. It can cause more harm than good.


 Which medications is she on?


 Stavelo is available in different prescript ion strengths and can be taken up to 8 times a day. You can always ask the doc about a lower mg because the pill will be smaller. She would have to take more of them but at least that may be an option. You can also ask to have her switched to another cholesterol med that is smaller. My Gma takes Lovastatin and the pill is pretty small. Namenda can come in liquid form and if you get one of those dosing syringes, you won't have to worry about over or under dosing which may happen if you use a spoon.


 Yes we tried both with Namenda but they seem to block her PD meds from being absorbed. She would shake more and have slower movements. Anyhow, any advice on how I can get her to swallow her pills? Here's something else. I purchased CVS brand of adult diapers. Last night my mom leaked from the sides so I still had to clean up a mess that she would normally have from wearing just her underwear. She often gets up in the middle of the night to pee but gets distracted with things and does not make it to the toilet and pees standing doing whatever she gets busy doing. Last night it was pushing a chair around her room. Is depends the only reliable brand? They are pretty expensive!


 i used Assurance from WalMart.They were better than depends for me......


 Hi,.. ..apple souse - actually always works in helping seniors to swallow there medicine, but it looks like u mom just doesn't wanna take them, whether u like it or not, and finds any possible way to trick u, and to make u upset.. but she doesn't mean it, it's part of her illness, which requires lots of patins as we all know.. I was taking care of an elderly man few years ago, who didn't like the meds at all, and actually what worked with him, is that I crashed his meds, then I would take a cold insure, pour some of it out and put the meds there whit-out him seeing, then shake it very good and give it to him.. he ofcours didn't finished it all at once, so I would come back in few min to offer it again.. or u can crashed them and just mix with pudding, or something else, so she doesn't see them there.. good luck


 Good Morning! I usually post on the fibromyalgia forum. My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's over six years ago. We have been playing this game with her that long, her refusal to take meds, etc. That is exactly what it is, a game and as frustrating as it is, you really can't blame them, it is the disease. It causes them to become so child-like yet if we treat them like children, they very much resent it. I realize you weren't asking me for this, you want an answer. I just felt compelled to write to let you know you are not alone in this frustration. My mom lived with me for only one year and I couldn't take it any longer, the stress was simply too much and my health really crashed. She went on to live with my sister for 3+ years and is now in assisted living, where she is really very happy, thank goodness! I think what your mom is looking for is someone to play with, to tease and she's found it in you. This really pushes your buttons and that's what she wants, it is amusing her. Maybe try giving the medications and walking away? Not saying a word about whether she took them or not? I wonder if that would work? Believe me, I feel your frustration...good luck, Miriam"
question about disruptive behavior,"Hi, I haven't posted here in a while but my fathers alzheimers is getting worse. I don't know what to do. For the last week he has not slept hardly at all during the night at the nursing home. He hollers and screams at the top of his lungs and he can't be still. He has fell once and hurt his hand real bad but he didn't break it. They have had to restrain him in his chair in the daytime. I don't mind it because I don't want him to hurt himself. We have had all kind of tests done and there is nothing physical wrong with him. There has been talk of sending him to a physciatric hospital because of his disruptive behavior. He keeps every one else upset when he hollers all the time. He can't take alot of medicine. It upsets him even worse. They have tried alot of medicine that he can take and nothing seems to work. What happens at the physciatric hospital and how long do they have to stay? I don't want him to go but I may not have a choice. I see their point. Thanks","I'm so sorry for the trouble you are having with your dad. My dad is in an earlier stage of Alzheimer's. I wish that I could say something to help. Best of luck to you all. Stacey


 I am glad to hear that the Ativan is helping. Hang in there.


 I talked to Daddy's doctor and the nursing home today. They said that there may not be anything that they can do for Daddy. They have tried about everything. The nursing home said that they have had patients that just hollered up untill they died. It is so sad. They did not recommend that he be sent out for the phyc. evaluation right now. As long as he doesn't try to hit anyone they won't kick him out, which eases my mind. I wished that I could take care of Daddy at home, but I can't lift him and I know that I can't do it. Thanks for listening.


 Thank you for replying Stacy. They had to try Ativan on Daddy to keep him calm. His first day is going pretty well so far. It seems like he's either going to doped up or screaming. A lose lose situation."
Anyone read Still Alice?,"My Dad had mild Alzheimer's with Parkinsons when he passed away a year ago. I recently read ""Still Alice"" by Lisa Genova which deals with a 50 year old Harvard teacher. She teaches, researches, and writes books. It tells of the progression of the disease from her eyes. It talks about the meds and different things to look for in the early onset of it. Lisa Genova holds a PHD in neurosience from Harvard and is an online columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association. Nana Monster","Just an update: I did read this book and it was very well written. I can see so much of what Alice went thru in the same manner in which I seen my Gma decline. Alzheimers is such a horrible horrible disease to have, not only on the people around them but for the ones going thru this. This book can give insight to caretakers that would never know what it's like. So my recommendation for ALL caregivers (and Alzheimer patients if they are able).....READ THIS BOOK!


 Hi am new to this site as of today..... I am a Caregiver re loved one with Alzheimers..... Here's my experience re the book ""Still Alice"".....I have tried to read it several times....since it was given to me...but can never get through it for some reason....think it's ""my stuff"" forsure.....the other issue is that I have read many many books re the topic in the last 12 years.....so that may have something to do with it....back to the book...I hear it is a very well written book.... thks all


 No I haven't but that sounds really interesting. We only have one member here that suffers from this (Snowylynn) and I always read her posts because I want to know what it is that they are going thru, in their own words and how it is affecting them. It gave me perspective into my Gma's world that I didn't have before. So I may have to give this book a read...Thanks Nana! :)


 Thanks for checking it out. I work in a nursing home and we have 2 floors of Alzheimers patients and I have seen many people who used to be customers of mine when I worked local retail years ago and parents of school mates. It's pretty heartbreaking to know there is little hope for this disease. That's why ""Still Alice"" is so good as it written as Alice faces the progression and her family's reactions. Nana Monster


 I have read this book n i do rec that others read it as well..but thats just my lil o..lynle opinion"
Is this typical of alzheimers disease?,"My mother is 94 and has alzheimers. Her vocabulary is a lot of mumbled up words that don't fit, along with a few moments of the proper use of words at times. She has started about 2 months ago to whine continually for hours, mostly high pitched moaning sounds, with begging and pleading words like ""please"" and ""mama"". She won't snap out of it no matter how hard my sister and I try to divert her attention to something else. She does this for hours on end, non-stop. Is this typical? We have stopped taking her out with us to the shopping mall, as people stop and stare at her now and us. She also has a terrible look on her face when she does this. My sister looks after her full time, as she never married and has devoted her life to her. I help when I can, but I am married and have a family. Any info would help. Thanks. Sincerely, Forget-me-not.","Thanks for the info. What are the end stages of this disease like? I'd like to be prepared for what is coming. Also, will my mother lose her speech totally at some point in time?


 Hi, again: Thanks for your reply. It was really appreciated. I live in Welland, Ontario, Canada. My sister and I still take our Mom out for Lunch once a week at the Mall, and sometimes to Swiss Chalet Restaurant, and Zellers Restaurant. Sometimes she forgets how to feed herself, but we show her how we do it, and then she is o.k. and gets started. She has a great appetite, and seems to really enjoy having a meal out. One time however, the waitress brought my sister's and my lunches first, as Mom's wasn't ready yet, and Mom got extremely upset because she didn't have any. We kept telling her that they were still cooking her meal, and we didn't start eating our meals or anything but nothing would calm her down. Now we always ask the waitress to bring Mom's meal first, even if ours is ready. We still take Mom out with us while shopping too. One doesn't see very many 90 plus year olds out in public anymore, I guess that is why people stare so much, too. A few times, teenagers make awful comments, like last week, one said ""Is that old lady ever ugly"", my sister and I heard it, but we hope Mom didn't. We always dress Mom up really nice, pretty dress, stockings, nice shoes, and Mom always loved hats, as she wore them all the time in her day, so we always put a nice hat with a flower on it, on her. Thanks again for your help and the ifo! Bye for now. For-get-me-not.


 Forget-Me-Not its Sassy again. Your mom is lucky to have you as a daughter. I remember going to visit my Grandma in her appartment. She would make breakfast 3 times thinking she did not have it. Then she swore there was a man living in the tree outside her window. She was on the 3rd floor. This went on for some time. She was brought home by the police a couple of times when she got lost going to the store. Good thing she never drove a car. I am trying to take care of my father-in-law who is getting worse daily it seems. Lucky for him, he's a veteran and they pay for most all of his care and drugs etc. He takes a drug called Exelon thats about 5$ a pill and had really slowed down the alzhiemers for about 1&1/2 yrs. However, it does not stop it, and now he's dropping quickly. The stress is over-whelming here for me. As I must feed him, give him his pills and take him to a thousand apts. My husband works later now and can't do as much now. On top of that, I have a 13 and 15 yr old kids that go to sports and band etc. around dinner etc. right when he demands his meals. Yeh, he yells for them now sometimes. He complains about them too which kinda p*sses me off sometimes as I do the best I can. I guess the added stress played a major role in my health over the past 2 yrs. I went into a bad flare up of colitis which I couldn't get dx until last april. Now I'm better on meds and an anti-depressant. But I still get tired and my hair falls out. Sorry for going on and on. Sometimes its good to let it out. Please stay in touch and take care...Sassy


 Happy Birthday Forget-me-not! My mom's birthday is also Sept. 10. I'm 42 and sometimes feel 82 but also sometimes feel 22. My daughter hates it when I try to wear young peoples clothes which make me look young. Now that I've lost 40 lbs. I can fit most of her clothes. However, those hippsters don't quite do the trick for my loose hanging tummy skin. So I stick to normal pants. I will wait to e-mail you because our computer needs to be re-programed. I can hardly get onto the board now. We just got more home support for Dad. Now he has a girl coming in Tue. Wed. and Fridays to dress and feed him in the morning. He goes to a adult daycare twice a week and that time in the morning is too busy for us all. So now he has someone for everyday except Sundays. What a relief. Have you thought of that for your Mom? Medical might cover it, you have to have a Doctors recommendation. Even if your sister can get away for a couple hrs on her own it can make a big difference, and she won't feel so tied down. We are tied to the house so to speak, and must be here for meals. Dad would only eat toast. And lately, he can't open the bread bags as he uses scissors and cuts the bag in half! Some things he does are quite funny actually. Yesterday he came looking for his ""tail gate"". What he actually meant was his walker! It took a while to figure that out. Well I'm off to taxi my daughter to a movie...there's always something. Take care....Sassy


 totally agree with snowy bout this it is the alzheimers ..it is now the most patience love and understanding this dd that is needed..my mom went from this my dad within less than a year,,,,it truly is a family disease imho..


 Hi, my father-in-law has alzheimer's and lives with us too. It has become almost impossible to look after him. He has home-care support too, but we cannot leave him alone now at all. The other day he tried to open a can with a 2-pronged meat spear. Anyhow, I also work in a Care Facility with a lot of alzheimer's residents. And yes, several of them make all sorts of noises, many chat away to ""who knows who"". Some seem like they are talking to another resident but are having their own little conversations. Many stare at the ground or are always touching their feet or something they think is on the floor. So as you may already know, the mind is a complex thing that, when altered can cause some to do all sorts of wierd things. I have a lot of respect for anyone trying to take care of a loved one in this state. Take care....Sassy


 Hi, sorry for the time wait, I generally spend most time on the UC forum. To the best of my knowledge, the disease can progress from the first noticable symptoms of forgeting words, etc. to not being able to speak in about 5-8 yrs. You can find out more by looking up Alzheimers on line. My Grandma went from normal to no speech and not being able to feed herself, incontenent etc. in about 8 yrs. She passed away a yr later at 88. In my work place, in the passed 6 yrs, I've known one lady who could not find her room, but could talk, remember her kids etc. and was and is a wonderful happy laughing lady. Now she still smiles and laughs, which is rare for these people. She does not know her kids, can't feed herself, is incontenant and is blind. She cannot carry a conversation, but says words. I still love to see her, but my heart goes out to her daughters who visit. It's a hard thing to see your own mom like this. Do not let any stares or quiet comments stop you from taking your Mom out in public. Trips out are wonderful, and who cares what others may think!!! We don't have much of that kind of discrimination here in Canada. Not that I've noticed. Where do you live? There are national American and Canadian Alzhiemer's Disease Centers that may be of help to you. Best of luck Forget-me-not....Sassy


 My mother had Alzheimer's for a couple of years before she died of a blood clot from hip surgery. I read several books on the disease, but have forgotten most of what I read. It can be scary for the person because they forget where they are and may even not know you. It is anxiety producing for the patient. Short term memory goes completely later on. My mother forgot how to work her checkbook first, then how to cook. When she was in the hospital after surgery she couldn't remember that she had a device, a call button on the bed, to call for help if she needed it. What was really disappointing and scary was that the nursing staff was ignorant of the disease. They couldn't understand why she seemed so helpless. She had just spent about 6 weeks with my brother and wife and they had brought her back to her home and I was visiting. One of her suitcases was in the floor and she stumbled over it coming out of the bath room and broke her hip. As a result, she died in the hospital from a blood clot. This is a terrible disease for the one who has it.


 Hi, Sassy: You sure have a lot going on around your house! Things have slowed down around here, as my last son moved out the end of August. I have 3 sons, Alan is 22, Kevin is 20, and Ryan is 18. I am now trying to adjust to empty-nest syndrome. My birthday was on Wednesday(last week) the 10th, and I was 49. Next year is the big 50. I saw my Mom and she even signed her name on the birthday card, and said Happy Birthday to me. For about 5 minutes she knew who I was, which was really nice and a special moment for me. We (my sister, Mom, and I) all went out for breakfast after that. I sure hope the Colitis eases up with the medication for you. I hope you don't have to stay on anti depressants very long. I took Prozac for about 2 months, that was 5 years ago when my boys were all teenagers and the stress level was pretty high at that time. I didn't like the effect that it had on me, as I felt like I had no emotions at all, and absolutely nothing bothered me, all of which is a really strange feeling. I finally got out of depression on my own, by taking 2 hours every day for myself, no one was allowed to bother me, and I would go for a walk, or lay down, or bake something. That really worked for me. You need the committment and the support of everyone in the family to make it work, too, no exceptions to the two hours of not being bothered for anything. Sassy, my email is lornadavies@yahoo.ca if you want to send an email instead of using this board. Would be glad to keep in touch with you. Bye, for now. Forget-me-not.


 What you are experiencing Is typical of Alzheimer's"
Family History - when should testing begin?,"Hi everyone. I'm guessing that a lot of you are on here because you care for family members with this very difficult disease. On my mother's side her father and his sister had severe Alzheimer's. My grandfather ""had it"" (showing symptoms) for about 6 years...the last 2 pretty bad before he passed. But my Aunt had it for around 12 and had been on Aricept all that time. My Great Aunt just passed last week at 89 and hasn't known any of us for about 4 years now. My question is, because of my strong family history (I know it goes back longer than that...and believe there is some history on my father's side as well) when should my mother, especially begin the testing process? She just turned 50 and I want her to do as much as she can. I also want to be aware for myself in the future - although hopefully there will be a ""cure"" or something more by then. thank you all so much","She's actually not showing symptoms at all - I actually think I'm more forgetful than her :) I just remember hearing about studies where they can start testing you and get you on medication sooner than later if they turn out positive for some things? I haven't researched it too much, so I should probably spend some more time doing that. Thank you!


 Wow thank you soo much! They say a 96% accuracy rate - that's amazing and perfect, because I don't think I could get her to go to a doctor, so online will be good. Also to know for myself - I'm only 26 now...but seeing my family go through it - the earlier the better for me!


 Is your Mom showing symptoms? If so go now!!


 I just heard of a new test developed by universities that is supposedly more accurate than older tests and can be done online. I think there's a small charge for interpretation. Here's the link: http://www.utk.edu/tntoday/2010/03/11/new-alzheimers-test/"
physc hospital,"Hi, My father was transferred to the mental hospital on Sunday because he was still hollering and screaming and knocked a cup out of a male nurses hand. He is supposed to be there for 10 days. So far they have not impressed me. He is still the same way as he was in the nursing home. They said that sometimes they can help people and sometimes they cant. I asked one of the nurses back at the nursing home what would happen if Daddy came back to the nursing home and did the same things. She said that he wouldn't meet the critera to stay in the nursing home, so basically they would kick him out. What is the next step? A mental hospital for good? They are none around here. They are all a long way from home and I couldn't go see Daddy everyday and keep an eye on him. Does anyone know where you go if you don't ""meet the critera"" for a nursing home? I am so depressed. Thanks, Dorseys daughter","Hi, We don't have anything like that in our area. I can only hope that Daddy gets better. Dorseys daughter


 Hi, They have a special care unit in the nursing home where Daddy is but if they become combative or really restless, or holler like Daddy does they make them go to the mental hospital so they can adjust their meds. If they are still acting the same when they come back they will ship them off to a mental hospital for good. I don't want my Daddy to be instituionilized. So far I cannot see anything different that they have done that they didn't do in the nursing home. He is still acting the same, but they have 5 more days so maybe he will get better. Dorseys Daughter


 My father has been at the physc hospital for nine days now and is no better. In fact they have had to give him fluids twice because he has been so dehydrated. He is not eating or drinking much. They don't know when they will release him and every day is another $100.00 that we have to pay to the nursing home to hold his bed but they don't care. Dorseys Daughter


 Thanks, Stacey.


 I am so sorry to hear that you and your father are going thru this. When I was signing my gma up at the assisted living center they mentioned that if a resident becomes agressive that they would be sent to a hospital for physciatric (sp?) care and if they were unable to come back to the assisted living center that they would have to be place there permantly for their own protection as well as others. I know this is not an easy thing to do. Have you talked to anyone at a local senior protection services or a senior advocate service just to see what other options you may have?


 I too am so sorry this is happening..here we have homes that are one area for non combative /aggressive ad people in one area and then the other ones in special care units..i am in canada/ontario.....is there places like that where you are ..plz know your dad n you are in our prayers..keep us posted..lyn


 P.S. We live in a rural part of Alabama where there aren't many resources. Thanks


 Hang in there! Thinking of you.... Stacey


 I am so so sorry..will keep you in prayers..lyn"

50 and diagnosed with AD,"Hi Everyone - Most of the threads I am reading all deal with seniors and their families that are effected by AD. Does anyone have advice for me. I am 48 - my husband is 50 - we have twins that are 14 years old. I think I have come to terms with the diagnosis - 20 mg of Lexapro doesn't hurt either. I have stopped thinking about the things we won't share as we get older and don't wake up thinking OMG one less day - My mindset is THANKD GOD - another day with him - I love him so much more than words can say - I also think my husband has - his take on it - I can't control it so I am going to take one day at a time. He reads constantly and just finished our taxes and did a great job. He keeps very active. He is currently on Aricept, Namenda and the Exelon patch. He also has chronic neurological lyme disease. I wonder how much of this is the lyme too. Does anyone have any advice or wisdom to share with me...... HopeFloats","Why is he on 3 meds for AD? generally its Aricept,Razadyne,OR exelon with Namenda......not all 3 at the same time.Maybe the Dr thinks more is better....NOT!


 Not sure if its dangerous but iffy i would think.......I'm holding my own on Galentimine(razadyne)..But then I have vasular dementia.........According to my Neuro.I'm doing great.......


 Hi Hopefloats, I am 49 and suffer from nuerological lyme disease like your husband. I spend most of my time on the lyme and ms forums and dropped in here expecting to find a mostly senior group discussing the challenges of AD. I was not expecting to see your post here as you guys are roughly the same ages as my wife and me. My uncle was diagnosed with early onset AD at age 56. Sometimes I wonder if perhaps my uncle might have been exposed to lyme disease at some point in his life. Have you posted your husbands issues on the lyme forum? Are you comfortable that you have a definitive diagnosis of AD? Praying that your husbands issues are lyme related.


 Hi Hope, I know how difficult this must be for you and your family. We are here to listen and offer spiritual comfort when you need it.


 No, I am sorry I don't have any advice, but I wish you the best. It is devastating, I know. I am so sorry. AngelsMamaDorseysdaughter


 Hi SnowyLynne How are you doing? Why not all three - he seems to be holding his own. Is it dangerous


 I would be asking the doc why all 3 as well..i totally agree its a bit iffy as snowy put it ....i wish you all the best n plz keep us posted...lyn


 Hi Betterhealth - Yes I have been on the Lyme Disease forum and have had a great experience with all of the people there. Very knowledgeable and caring. I am learning to deal with the diagnosis of AD. His grandfather suferred from it. It is/has been devasting news to digest. I have learned many things about AD. Jim having neuro lyme (encephalopathy) is one of the things that can cause early onset lyme. Plus he had a severe head injury when he was 18 years old. Hit head on by a drunk driver and spent several weeks in the hospital with head trauma. We have twins that are 14 years old. A boy and a girl. I don't tell them much - not sure they need to know right now. They take great care of their Dad. I have the mind set now that every day is a gift. Take Care, Hope


 Keeping you in heart thoughts n prayers for sure lyn"
My 87 yr old Dad...,"Hello All, My dad has just been hospitalized initially for severe low sodium. After being in the hospital for about 2 weeks, they regulated his sodium, but unfortunately he's been showing signs of dementia/AD more now than just before he was hospitalized. In hindsight, I've been able to see his relative steep decline over the past 6 months...more now than while it was occuring. My dad always had what I would consider a mild case of ADD. I used to kid with him as I was growing up about my needing to explain myself within the 1st few sentences or I'd lose his attention and would have to re-explain myself. Mom would always laugh and call it selective hearing. Well, in any case, because of that for nearly all of my 50 years, it's hard to see changes in that behavior getting worse. Dad was starting to repeat himself more, ask the same questions over and over, and we'd have nearly the same conversation on the phone each time we talked. I'm in another state...1,500 miles away with my husband. We have no children (I couldn't have any) and I have developed many health problems over the past 5 years...including lung cancer and I am currently nursing a broken leg. I mention all of that for a reason. We also don't have the money right now to fly down to see my dad...the earliest would be around October when we can have time to come up with the $$$ to fly down. Since dad also has lost most of his hearing, it was becoming more and more difficult to talk to him without my having to nearly scream on my end...and 1/2 of the time he wouldn't understand what I was saying. He insisted that he needed to take out his hearing aid while on the phone because it would give him problems. In doing so, I nearly had a nervous breakdown trying to talk with him on the phone. He was stubborn to change his phone to one that was for the hearing impaired so I didn't have to go through what I did everytime we spoke on the phone. He would tell me that nobody else complained and I was being rediculous...AGH! Well, this past July he was coming up for a visit to see us...I couldn't wait! I missed him so much and couldn't wait to see him. On the day he was supposed to come up, he missed his flight. When he called he said he didn't wait to see us and maybe he'll be up another time. I was devastated! He would not admit to missing his flight. It took 2 weeks for dad to make arrangements for his trip up here with the airlines again. This time it was for the 1st week of August. Would you believe he missed his flight again? Now I was getting worried. At least this time he admitted to missing his flight. He lives 40 miles from the airport. Being stubborn as he is, I told him if he could find someone at his church to drive him back and forth to the airport. My sister lives down there about 20 miles from him too (that's another part of a sad story...and I know the reason why she didn't drive him back and forth). Anyway, Dad at least took my suggestion of driving to a motel close to the airport the night before and he could take the shuttle the next moring. Thank goodness that worked well. He made it up here and it was a wonderful visit! I'm grateful for the time we had here because it looks like now it will be the last time he'll be able to come up again :( While he was here, in hindsight, there was only one occurance of my dad having ""unusual"" behavior. During a period of a 1/2 an hour one afternoon, my dad would get up, walk to the bedroom and check his paperwork for his flights home...wanting to make sure everything was in order, then come back and sit on the couch with me. He did that about 10-12 times. By the 6th time I was pulling my hair out from constantly reassuring him he's all set and there won't be any problems for his returning home. After his aggitation/worry finally ended...part of which was due to him exhausting himself, he was back to ""normal""...thankfully. That night, after I went to bed, I chalked it up to him over worrying due to all the problems he had getting up here...and his age too. I knew then it probably would be the last time he's be able to make it up here on his own...just didn't realize how much his health was declining til now. Before I bring you to the current status, I just want to mention a few other things... My sister has made herself POA...which makes sense since she is 20 miles from him. Since he has been in the hospital, I have been treated like a second class citizen related to my receiving info of dad's health. The hospital...and now the nursing home he is currently in for a temp status for the next 2-3 weeks while they monitor his progress...will only give me the bare minimum of his health info. They said it's up to my sister to relate the info to me since she is POA...AGH! Well, that's all fine and dandy if she wasn't a ""toxic"" sister. I trust her as far as I can throw her. She is an evil manipulator. I could go on and on about her, but this forum isn't about her issues...it's about my concern about our dad. Ok, almost done... Since she plays head games with me on the phone, and can't believe a word she says when she does call, I'm limited to what I think is true or false. She tells others...like dad's pastor different things and makes me out to be the ""bad"" daughter trying to create problems for dad...which is all part of the manipulating my sister has me fall for her mind games and pushing my buttons. I am concerned for dad's welfare! Getting back to where I was... Just before dad left here in September after his wonderful visit, my husband bought him an early Christmas present of a new phone for the hearing impared. Thankfully, with my husband's help, he was able to convince my dad that it would also benefit him to have this phone too so he could also hear better and we could enjoy talking with each other more...YAY! After he got back home, it took til nearly Thanksgiving for him to finally get a neighbor to put his new phone in...completely forgetting all we said. Again, I just chalked it up to his stubborness, independance and him not liking anyone to tell him what to do...big sigh. So since then, it had been wonderful talking with him on the phone...WooHoo!...Until about a month ago. There was 2 devastating events for him. He was told that his driver's licence was going to be taken away and one of his best friends, my Godmother, just passed away. For the next 2 weeks he had a hard time handling anything...telling me he couldn't sleep and was repeating everything on the phone over and over. Two weeks ago my sister called to let me know dad was in the hospital. she described the last day with him. She was following him to a restaurant and he was all over the road. When she mentioned that to him, dad seemed fine driving after that when she followed him home. During the next hour, she described him as having hallucinations...seeing ants all over the place and walking as if he was drunk. He also was going from talking in the present to as if he was back in the 40's. My sister got him in the car and drove him to the hospital. He refused to go into the emergency room, so my sister had to drive him back to his home. As he was then walking around the house, he collasped in the kitchen and banged his head...at which point then my sister was then able to call an ambulance. While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, my dad stood in place, while bleeding profusely from his head...and counting his change in his pocket over and over!!! OMG!!! So after the hospital regulated his severe low sodium, he now is what I would consider to be between level 5 and 6 of the AD stages. I'm devastated! I can't do anything up here in Nebraska to help him. My sister is now in control of everything. I learned today I don't have any say or rights...even though I'm also his daughter. My main concern again is my dad and his care. Another point I want to make is that before dad left here in September, I wanted to make sure that he had a living will/trust set up incase anything happened. Dad would tell me often during the past several years that my sister kept trying to get him to live with her. He doesn't want to...and for good reason. One of my sister's daughters lives with her...is an alcohalic (according to dad and friends of the family), which is why my sister is taking care of her 2 grandchildren...because her daughter can't take care of herself! In addition, one of the grandchildren has severe ADD and another associated mental disorder. So, I find it upsurd that my sister would even consider taking in dad into her care. Dad would tell me on the phone how it would be very upsetting to him to be around the disabled grandchild. So now my sister wants both dad with his AD and her grandchild with AD in the same house with her alcohalic daughter????? The last time my sister and I talked on the phone today, she was over at my dad's with him! The hospital gave him the afternoon to go back home, water his plants and grab a few things he wanted. I could hear his aggitation in the background. My sister told me that for the 1st 2 weeks after he gets out of the hospital, she will live with him in his home. Dad lives in a retirement community which only allows others to live there for a max of 2 weeks, otherwise that get thrown out. In addition, my sister has a dog, and dog's aren't allowed...so she makes her own rules. She also said that she will be having her daughter move out of her house with her grandchildren so dad can move in without a problem. Well, one might consider that to be admirable, she is also of coarse POA, but what kind of a situation is that? To have her alcohaulic daughter to take care of her children again? And the trust I have for my sister is about nil to none, do I really believe she won't put her daughter and her children in a motel til things ""settle"" with dad and the transition from the nursing home...then bring them back home...all then living in a very sick, disfunctional enviornment??? I know from what my sister told me, that her alcohaulic daughter has only a hairdressing job. How can she take care of 2 kids, in her condition, pay rent in an apt at best, and look out for them properly for the length of time dad might need full care...could be up to 10 years. Back to what happened today... I mentioned to my sister today after she insisted that sh'll be taking care of dad somehow, that dad had a living trust/will made out around October after he left here...and that if he could no longer take care of himself in his own home with inhome care, that he wanted to be in a Veteran's home. She said oh, really?...and then handed the phone to dad. Since dad was so aggitated that I was able to hear him in the background, he was yelling at me when he got on the phone. His only concern was watering his plants and making sure he got back to the hospital ontime. I tried to tell him to make sure he is happy and told him that my sister is still trying to get him to live with her. I told him to please make sure you tell her about your living will/trust. Oh boy, did he get angry with me...Don't talk to me about that! I had to let it go...there seemed to be no point...he wasn't in his right mind. At that point...I just told him I love him and hope he gets better soon. He said he loves me too. I'm sorry this was so dragged out, but it's the full picture. I guess my hands are tied and there is nothing I can do. I think $$$ is the driving force of my sister not putting him in a home. He could go through all of his assets in just a few short years. I feel like a lost puppy not knowing what to do or if there is anything I can do...it's an aweful feeling. I can only pray my dad gets the best care and he is happy...and his wishes will be/are being fulfilled. I know I'm not the only one in a disfunctional family with sibling issues which only add problems to the care of a family member with AD... Can anyone give me any advice as to what if anything I can do? I can't control my sister, I can't control my dad...so I just let go of everything and pray? Is that it? Here with a heavy heart... Susan Post Edited (Susan1977) : 2/20/2010 8:07:43 PM (GMT-7)","Susan, I do hope that someone else will have more practical help for you - some way of getting him out of your sister's house. I suppose I was not encouraging in that regard. :( Stacey


 Susan, Is there a way to get your dad's pastor to check on him from time to time? I wonder if it would make you feel better if someone (other than your sister) could give you an unbiased assessment of how your dad is doing? Do you like any of her kids? Or is the alcoholic the only one? In some way it is good that your dad will be among familiar faces. Being in a strange place can be very frightening to an AD patient. I hope that can comfort you a little. I have seen so much ugliness in people when money is involved. Even seemingly good people can have very bad judgement. You know your sister best. Wishing the best for you and your father. Stacey


 Susan, I am so sorry to hear of your situation. My father also has alzheimer's. It is just a horrible disease. It has been difficult watching his decline and I expect that the worst is yet to come. There are so many things that are just out of your hands. And it does seem that money is such a driving force and so often causing people to do things and make decisions that are not the best. My sister is not controlling my dad, but I do understand. My sister is in control of her daughter (obviously). Child Protective Services has been involved repeatedly. I am telling you this because I have to find a nice, albeit fake way to be nice to her. Doing this allows me to make sure that my niece stays safe and has just a little better life than she might otherwise. I do think it would make things easier for you if you could find a way to communicate with your sister. Maybe you are already and you are just frustrated because you know the truth behind what she it doing. If so, I completely understand. There isn't a thing I can do or say to help you, Susan. I so wish that I could, because I can hear your pain. I am saying a prayer for you and your father. Stacey


 Hello Stacey, Bless your heart for your prayers. I wish my sister was taking dad into her home for the right reasons and her home was a healthy enviorment. If that was the case, I wouldn't have reason to be worried or concerned. I just spoke with the head nurse on the night shift where my dad is... I was grateful for her disclosing to me the confirmation of dad will be moving in with my sister. My sister was telling everyone else that he will be going into a nursing home...including dad's pastor!!! I also shamefully despise her also being in control of everything including his phone calls...and listening into whatever I say to him. She has been doing that since he has been in the hospital...it's maddening! Shame on her...the manipulating of every aspect of dad is ripping me to pieces. I wouldn't be surprised if she goes through all of his assets and tucks them away for herself too. It's one thing to use his assets for his care. I also wouldn't mind if she took more for all the care dad would need, added expenses and a form of payment for her time...but I've already started to think that she will take everything. And then I think of the grandchildren...being put back in the hands of a mother that can't take care of herself...or worse...all under the same roof with dad having AD. I'm surprised that health and human services don't check for individuals leaving the hospital to make sure they will be in ""good"" care. I have nerve wracking thoughts of my dad having an ""issue/being aggitated"" when the grandchild has an issue with the severe ADD...and an alcoholic in the same house... I'm sick over not being able to do anything...at the same time, if I don't let it go, my health will be affected :(


 Your hands aren't completely tied just because your sister has POA. Yes the POA has the final say on almost everything BUT if you think that by moving your father into her home is not a good environment for your father, then you might want to contact your father's state senior protective services. They step in when a senior is in an unstable evironment or being abused (I'm not saying your sister is abusing your dad, it's just the services they offer). They might even be able to offer some advice for you."
Help on power of attorney rights,"Hi, If I have have 'medical power of attorney' for a person, what does that allow me to do? (this person may have the beginning stages of dementia). Can I meet with this person's doctor and get a medical history, health status, etc for this person? I have contacted this person's doctor, but they seem to be unwilling to give me any information, even thought I told them I have power of attorney. Can someone explain what rights I have? or point me to a website (in the archives for this board?) that can explain my rights? I assume that there must be 'standard protocol' to follow in these cases. If it matters, this person lives in Michigan. thanks","Bringing up for rr1

 Please do see the thread by Kitt on Medical POA


 Hi, I don't belong to this board but saw your thread and might be able to answer the question. Typically a medical power of attorney allows you to make medical decisions for someone once they are unable to. If the person who gave you this POA is still competent you usually do not have the ability to get info or make decision for them at that point. It is not until they are unable to do so that you may step in and make decisions for them. However, they may sign a release to give you access to this information or sign a more broad power of attorney allowing you immediate access rather than waiting for them to become incapacitated.

NEeding advice,"Ive been trying to get through to my mom I need more than 3 hours a week off from taking care of my grandmother who has sun downers and dementia. I've gotten to the point when it is a bad moment with her that I take to biting myself to prevent me litterly telling her way to put it. I know it is the disease doing this to her. But I need more breaks. How do I get it through my moms head that 3 hours is not enough time off? During the bad moments, my grandmother threatens to kill myself or herself. Then after about an hour, she has utterly no memory of it happening. It is her disease, I know it. How can I vent out my frustrations more healthy? I have tried locking myself in my room but then she just pounds and pounds and pounds on the door, screaming, yelling, cussing, threatening. This happens about once a week to where it gets severe.","Yes she takes a medication for it, but it does not help. I actually am crying when I talk to my mother. I tell her how things are, but in a respectively manner. No one seems to have the ""time"" she says. She only will do one day for 3 to 4 hours a week because it upsets her too much to see her mother like that. You think she would understand how I feel..but no. One time, my grandmother even managed to trigger my depression severe enough where it took all I had to calm down and not act stupid. I got over it, with the help of my cat. I respond very well to pet therapy, thank goodness. I just be honest with my mom and say ""I need more time off mom""


 I have 4 living sibblings, and they live on the other end of the state. And do not be ashamed for saying she's being disrespectful, because I feel the same way. And you guys really understand the full story, that is why I was asking how I could get more help.


 Also RED CROSS n other agencies provide respite care or come in for 2 to whatever the doc has ordere in hours they mk meals do shopping ect i SO SO AGREE WITH RED its yr gma n i am proud of you for stepping up BUT she has a daughter that needs to STEP IN N STEP UP PLAIN TRUTH I wish you all the best hugs lyn


 Is your grandmother on any medications for her demetia? It does indeed sound like you need more respite. When you talk to you mother, are you demanding or do you ask politely for more help?


 Wait a minute, you're saying that your mom thinks it is too hard to see her mother this way but yet you are there 24/7, coping with your Gma while having many health issues of your own??? I mean no disrespect but it seems your mother is being a bit selfish. If that is the case, then you may not be able to find a way to talk her into coming over more. But you can keep trying because no one can be in that situation all the time and not be stressed over it. Do you have siblings that can help out more?


 I would call g'ma's doctor's office and find out if they have a social worker on staff, and if so, call a meeting with the social worker and your family, sibs and mom and if not, maybe the doctor would meet with all of you. Someone has to get it through your family's head that you need more than just 3 hours a week. Sadly, most people that have not experienced caring for someone with dementia simply do not get it, they just don't. I went through the same thing. My mom has Alzheimer's and for the first year, she lived with me. My sisters took turns picking her up on Sundays from 1 until about 5. I had a woman come in during the week, but she was here ONLY when I was at work, so that really didn't help me, but my sisters just didn't see it that way. They were just ""too busy"". My health finally forced me to look for places where my mom needed to live, I just couldn't do it any longer -- I have fibromyalgia. One of my sisters finally stepped in and said she'd take my mom. It was only then that she realized what I was going through. I really believe you need a professional to try to get through to your family what you are going through. You can also try calling the Alzheimer's hotline which you can get at www.alz.org. There are wonderful people there very willing to listen and offer help. You did not mention that your g'ma had Alz, but the organization covers dementia and sundowning. I wish you well, Miriam"
Terminal restlessness,"I don't know if anyone has heard of this before or not, but I posted about this a while back, but I didn't know what it was called. No one at the nursing home had ever heard of this. Hospice told me about it. about a month before Daddy died, he could not be still. It was like he was driven to move. He couldn't be still. And he started hollering day and night at the top of his lungs. Well they did all kind of tests and couldn't find anything wrong with him . The nursing home got tired of him hollering and they told me that he needed to go to the phys hospital to get his medicines adjusted. They said that his alzheimers was getting worse. I didn't know any better so I sent him up there. He never got any better. He had just about stopped eating at the nursing home. When he got to the phys hospital, he quit eatting and they had to keep giving him IV fluids. I talked to his regular doctor and he told me that Daddy was dying. The phys hospital still didn't want to release him. They said that nothing was wrong with him. I think they just wanted to keep getting money. I made them release him after 12 days. Any way when I researched caring for the dying on the internet, the terminal restlessness popped up and that was exactly what Daddy was experienceing. He had started to die when he developed the terminal restlessness and I didn't know it. My point is: Nursing homes deal with death everyday. Why didn't they know about this? I asked two of Daddy's nurses today if they have ever heard of this and they said no. If I had known, I would have brought my Daddy home then, instead on making him go to the phys hospital. They made me and my sister feel so bad because Daddy was hollering and couldn't be still. They implied that he could stop if he wanted to because there was no physical reason for him to be hollering. Anyway, I wanted to put this out there so nobody else would have to go through what my family did. I feel cheated out of the two weeks that he was at that hospital. If your loved one starts hollering and can't be still , they can't help it and there is a name for it.","Thank you for sharing this in your time of grief. Stacey


 My condolences of your loss. Thank you for sharing. Because I refuse to let loved ones go into a nursing home, I bend over backwards. I live with my grandmother who has dementia taking are of her while I fight chemotherapy. I don't know how I do it, but it is surely the Grace of God. I used to work in a nursing home, I saw too much behind seens in there, and I refuse to put people in until I utterly kill myself trying to do it. I am so far handling it.


 Thanks for sharing in my years as a geriatric nurse i have seen this a couple of times so yes i do know it exists Some just are not fully educated about geriatrics and AD Again i am so sorry for your loss blessings lyn


 Hospice personnel seem to be well-versed on this subject, but I had never heard the term until last night. For two days now my mom has been up and down, sleeping very little, but not knowing what she wants to do. A hospice aide came and sat with her so that we could get some sleep but it has continued this morning. Medication seems to help very little at this point. Our nurse does not seem to think Mom is quite at the official terminal restlessness stage yet, but I cannot imagine it getting worse. No hallucinations so far... this is a very sad thing to watch someone go through, and it is very debilitating on the entire family. I am so sorry for your loss!


 Not all Nursing Homes are bad you really ned to check out the reports filed..incident reports ..neglect ect .. prior to putting loved one in homes i too worked for yrs in my own Retirement Home/ nursing home n everyone was treated with dignity ..respect n cared for by my staff when mom got bad i looked after her at home dad as well i did not want others looking after them as i felt it was only proper to do it myself i did hv help from Red Cross.. i was able to hv time away which is important imho just my thoughts lyn"
Child Proofing errr Adult profeeing?,"Having a fun issue... She is getting up in middle night of while I sleep and unlocking the front door, then leaving the door open and returning to bed.

Install a keyed lock high up on the door and either keep the key in the lock (and hopefully she won't see it) or take the key out. You can also install a security chain high up as well.

Best way to introduce the outside Help?,"We have been strictly taking care of my Grandmother by family. This week Wednesday will be our first time having outside respite.

 Dementia can cause some really bad insecurities and not trusting people they don't know. If at all possible, can someone be there with this person along with your grandma? When I brought someone in to help care for my mom, I told mom that she was there to help ME. My mother to this day and she is 7 years into AD, at least from diagnosis, so probably much longer, she still doesn't think she needs help and fights off anyone that tries to help her with a shower, etc...except if it is one of her daughters. She is such a proud and stubborn woman! But, that doesn't happen with everyone. It just worked better for us to tell mom the help was for me, to help around the house, and then she seemed more acceptable of her presence. Good luck! Miriam


 Crossing my fingers for you Desiree!


 I think my grandma has sun downs or something like that. She gets worse and restless in the night. Today she was cussing me out because she asked me why the cat wasnt eating so i said ""You fed her 3 times earlier today so I bet shes full"" and I got cussed out for that. *scratches head* My mom is going to come in for a weekend next month and take care of grandma so I can get a break. So lookin forward to a weekend off!


 I already planned my break LOL! I'm going to McMennamins hotel and restraunt, staying there for a night and enjoying their soaking spa. Then I staying at the weekend at a friends, and going to a childs bday party with my kid. I'm loving this adventure


 Is there any way this outside help can come over before you leave your Gma with them? To get to know your Gma a little and visa versa?


 Thats a good idea Lynn, thanks. Red, I can ask if they can come a couple hours befor ehand.


 THank you hon. I had my mother arrange to come and be with the lady for a few hours to help ""ease"" things. Lets hope it works

 It's very common for dementia/AZ patients to get more confused at night. My gma had sundowner's too but she seemed worse on cloudy days. I dreaded cloudy days! lol But I'm glad you are going to be able to take a break. We all need that break so we can take a breath and relax a bit.

Is Defensive Behavior Also A Sign Of Alzheimers?,"I came home this evening and Mom wanted me to read something she wants to send to a local publication ""adding"" information to an article they had on our little community. The ""article"" is all over the place. Not sure what prompted it, but she seems to think not all the people who contributed to this community project got the proper credit, and she wants to set them straight. I questioned where the funding came from for this project because I thought a grant may have been involved and she didn't say anything about that in her ""article"". She said no grant. I was shaking my head thinking to myself that something wasn't quite right about the info she had and she talked to me as though I was a three year old. Told me not to shake my head, that she knew what she was talking about in a very, very nasty tone of voice. Sigh. She is taking every word and every action personally these days. What do you think? She has other signs of Alzheimers. I was just wondering if this is also a sign. Thanks, V","Yes, it can be an early sign. Mood and behavior changes are typical."
Sighs...,"I wish my family was more supportive and helps me out more. I solely take care of my grandmother with alheimers. I also am in chemotherapy too. I get 3 to 4 hours a week alone, where someone will watch her so I can go to the hospital and do my chemotherapy. That is not enough time. I've asked family for more time off and they say ""it hurts us too much to see her that way, thats why I only do thea 3 to 4 hours"". Like it doesnt hurt me to see her like this? I go through it 24/7 for 6 days straight before I get the whole 3 or 4 hours off. My grandmother also has Sun downers, so her nights and days are mixed up. I am lucky to get 3 to 4 hours sleep a night. I'm tired and cranky... thanks for letting me vent.","Ive gone as far as having protective services tell them I need more than that... I still dont get more time. The only time I got more is when I actually had a mental break down last month, and spent a week in Respite. My grandmother has started dillsions of we are trying to kill her (got to love Alheimers sometimes) and took to strangling us. Anyhow, after being strangled that day off and on, finding out a friend died, and had only slept 8 hours in 2 weeks, I got extremely depressed and thought of (well you know). I had the brains to know I did not really want that and knew I needed a break so I called my councelor. She admitted me into Respite for a week. I did great after I slept! She said it was the severe lack of sleep that brought that on. I am afraid that will happen again to me. I don't know what to do.


 I honestly dont know how I do it, and I've had all my doctors ask how I manage to care for her at the same time. The only thing I think is driving me is my hard core ARMY side and the fact I used to work in a nursing home so I know what it is like, and personally, if I was the Alheimers patient, I sure would want my depends changed promptly instead of whenever they can and that can be 4 or more hours away. Now Grandma thinks the living room is the bathroom :S She is getting downhill fast. I dont expect her to live another 2 years. I know thats an awful thing to say, but mind you, I worked in a nursing home. I notice strange things that happen towards the end of time.


 Melissa, I got to give you credit... you are the first to mention my signature and to read through it. I suffer from depression, but not nerely as bad as it suggests. I delibertly am not posting in depression forums, as to not ""shove"" someone over the edge. Yes I am very gun ho, and it ticks off my doctors. I've actually tried to get outside help, Grandmother earns too much. Heres the sad part.. She only earns $500 past the limit :( I can't afford There are only a small handful of Memory Units in my area, and all too pricely. So I'm expanding my search into nearby cities to find a Memory Unit Nursing Home to care for her that will accept Medicaid. For me to actually start looking for a place is showing a lot. It means I am really at the end of my ropes. My mom just started to accept the fact I need more help, and sent my sister to help me one day a week. Problem is my sister is very unreliable. Its happened only once so far :S My moms reasoning for her to not help more is ""It just hurts me too much to see my mom like this"". I felt like smacking her and saying ""and it doesn't hurt me?"" But you know, I didn't because she is my mother. I did figure out I am scared of the owl next to me LOL! Theres an owl that goes ""whoo whooo WHOOO whoo"" right outside in my yard and it keeps sounding like someone is going to break in LOL!. (had to give you guys a laugh)


 Stop asking & delegate instead......


 I'm sorry to say this because usually, at least to me, it should considered as a last resort. But it may be time to place your Gma in a home. You are suffering both mentally and physically. How can you properly care for your Gma when you are sick yourself? I know that it may be hard to consider this, I know it was for me and it tore me up.


 I read this post the other night and it's taken me until now to find it again. I couldn't remember which forum I found it in. I was forum jumping, just reading different posts when I couldn't sleep. I have been thinking about you ever since. I can't imagine what it must be like to deal with what you are dealing with. I can only wish that I had a fraction of the strength you do. I also just saw your post about your thyroid in the chronic pain forum. I just want you to know that from everything I have read of your posts since joining this forum, I think you are one heck of a strong and amazing lady. The bottom of all your posts may say you don't care, but I see a very caring person. So I hope you don't mind if I offer my opinion of the situation you vent about on this post. :) It seems to me like your whole family is used to you being the strong one and they are so wrapped up in letting you handle Grandma and their own emotions of not wanting to watch her go down hill that they can't see that you need them for once. You are sick right now too. You need your rest as part of your treatment and recovery. Four hours a week off to receive your chemo? That isn't time off. You are so generously and wonderfully caring for your Grandmother. It is time to take care of Smurfy for a bit so that you can get your strength back, kick this cancer out of your body and get back to your life. You can't do that if you are never getting a chance to rest and let your body heal. If they won't or can't step in and help you by taking care of Grandma while you concentrate on your treatment, then maybe temporarily seeking outside help is all you can do. It doesn't necessarily have to be permanent unless you decide it needs to be because of her deterioration. I think being strangled is pretty heavy duty stuff! Maybe if you present it to your family that way? Tell them that in case they haven't noticed, you have cancer, and several other illnesses that require treatment and above all REST in order to recover, and if they are unable or unwilling to step up to the plate and help you in your time of need, then you will have no choice but to enlist outside help by temporarily having to put your Grandma in a home until you have the energy to devote to her care again. That way you are first giving them the opportunity to cowboy up, so to speak. If the won't, you at least have done all you can and can have a clear conscience. No, homes are sometimes not the most pleasant of places. But maybe family members would pitch in more and visit more if she were in a home than they do when she is in your house because they assume that when she is in your home, she has attention 24/7, but they would know this is not the case if she were in a care facility. Just my thoughts. I may not know you in person, but I do care. You are important too. Don't dismiss your feelings and your importance. :) I know I'm just an outsider, and I don't know the whole situation, only what I can glean from your few posts here about the situation. But I can't help but think of my Grandma and what she would say if she were still alive and in this situation. She would kick my behind into next week if I jeopardized my health to take care of her. She would tell me that she had lived her life and I still had the chance at many more years and that I'd better not waste them. I know I don't know your Grandma, but I hope she would tell you the same thing mine would have if she could. Hugs, Melissa"
My Mother - My Best Friend,"donna1952 6/17/10 11:05 AM My Mother - My Best Friend Ok, this is the first time I have joined a group to talk about my Mother. This is really hard as you all know. My Mother was diagnosed 2 years ago. She has been changing since she had a knee replacement surgery 5 years ago. When she came to after surgery, she was so confused and really has never been the same since. She did go home, and seemed to come out of it. She lived in Georgia and I live in Missouri, but I talked to her on the phone everyday. As in my title states, she has always been my best friend, we have always talked every day. It became apparent that her personality was changing. Per my request she gave her Dr. permission to discuss with me my Mother's health. So I called her and told her about the changes in my Mother, and she checked her out. The Dr. told me she had cognitive problems and could not reason well, but it was not altz. Although she was diag. 2 years ago with Altz.(My Mother was worried about that because her Mother had it). My Mother got much worse. She said and did things she would never have done or said before. My Mother was a very kind person, she retired from a hospital where she was a nurses aide. She was the type of person that would loan money to people knowing she would never see it again. She never talked bad about anyone. Everyone loved her, she was so kind. She spent her life taking care of people. She was used by a lot of people because of her kindness, but she never felt bad about it, only said they were troubled and needed help. She always told us kids, she never wanted us to take care of her when she got older, and to put her in a nursing home. She is now in a nursing home in Missouri. I visit her every day. She broke her hip 2 years ago(while still at her home) it did not heal, so she is in a wheel chair. She know me, and asks to go home with me at times. I can not lift her in and out of bed or the car, so I am unable to bring her home. I feel so guilty leaving her in the nursing home, and stay awake nights, trying to figure out how I can bring her to my home and take care of her. Then I remind myself, that she always told us to put her in a home. And I am ok for awhile. It seems so unfair that such a wonderful, sweet person can be in this condition now. Sometimes I don't think she really knows who I am. One day she asked me where my Mother was. But most days when I walk in, she smiles real pretty, and says ""There's Donna"".","imho you are doing what she asked for i am very struck by your caring n loving of your momma both my parents are gone now mom was a shell of self and im faily certain dad just went with a broken heart... bless you for being there for your momma hugs lyn


 just wondering how you are making out hugs lyn


 Out of love she bade you and your siblings to put her in a home. She didn't want you to have to go through all the pain, hardship, time of all the care she needs. There is a thing called Sara Lift (a machine that moves the patients from bed to wheelchair, etc) that can be used to aid in moving a person who otherwise can not. You are doing what she wants. My best advise, since she is in a nursing facility, go every day like you are, but make sure it is on different shifts every day. Do not do a spefic time, do not call ahead. I spent 4 years working in a nursing facility, and I know what happens when family is not around. The patients that has family coming everyday at any moment of the time of day gets the best care. It is indeed sad, of what the elders go through. It shocked and dismayed me to walk on shift and find out from a patient they were soiled and hadn't been changed for an hour. I put all my patients first, I worked through my breaks and just claimed to take a break, listened to them, talked to them, showed them a kinder heart, just so they know someone actually cared and had some respect. That is why, I told my family when my grandmother needed to go to a home, I told them over my dead body and I was moving in first. She still is now in her very house, with me as a 24/7 caregiver doing it all for her. I am now starting to get help from the rest of the family, for the first time in two months I'm just now starting to get a few hours to myself here and there. Since your mom wants the nursing faciliity, do that for her, so she gets good care. I tell people how it is behind the scenes- of what we hide from people to make them aware so they can avoid it happening.


 wondering how you are doing and how your momma is


 Welcome to the AZ forum Mimi :) I'm so sorry to hear that your mother is deteriorating. This disease is not easy on everyone involved. Please don't hesitate to stop in more often. I'm also so sorry to hear about your husband as well :(


 I'm sorry to hear about your mother. My dad is fighting this right now, but he is still living with my mother. It pains me so much each time I visit, because I really miss him. Sending you good thoughts and (((hugs))) Stacey


 Hi Donna. I am in the same situation. My mother was diagnosed almost 2 years ago and is fading fast. What a horrible disease. I too, am in Missouri. Well, Belleville, Il. Maybe we can talk. Take care.


 I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. It is so hard to watch the people we love decline in health and mind. We are here for you and anytime you want to chat, come to us because we can understand.


 Not all homes are like that imho i owned a retirement home and this was not the case check out their rep n if charges hv been filed or anything against home you are looking at tk care lyn


 It is so hard to see your mother deteriorate before you eyes. It was probably 2006 before I realized my mother was growing frail and getting confused. She didn't relate to her doctor, so I took her to another one. After a few appointments my sister and I decided to try a new one and that has worked out well. She has been on Namenda and Aricept but is still deteriorating to the point where she is probably at Staes 4-5. I joined this forum when my husband learned he had prostate cancer, and I see I should have been visiting the part of the forum, too."
"My Grandmother quit eating,new in Nursing home","My Grandmother recently was put in a Assisted living nursing home because she was diagnosed with Advanced Dementia and Sundown Syndrome she has been in the Nursing Home since Early December and has not eaten a thing!She doesn't want to eat and says she is ready to go to Home to Heaven.The nursing home has given her some ""shakes""that are like eating a meal and other than that water and the occasional tea is all she has had.Has anyone else had this trouble with a loved one?Any advice would be appreciated.I am afraid she will die if she doesn't eat soon and she has lost over 30 lbs and is too weak to get out of bed now!","My grandmother got to the point that she would not eat, even if someone sat with her for a long time and tried to coax her and feed her, etc. The doctor said it was advanced Alzheimers, and that she didn't know she was supposed to eat, and she didn't feel hungry. There was nothing we could do. They finally put in a feeding tube, but she never really had any quality of life after that. The feeding tube just postponed the inevitable for a few months. So sorry you are having to deal with this. I know it is not easy. Peace Be With You, V


 Some homes, will let you ""check a patient out"" and bring them back later. Maybe you can try taking her to one of her favorite restraunts with the entire family, and have everyone order food. That way she seees its ok to eat, by seeing you eat. Sometimes, like my Gma thinks the food is poison... so I just have something delivered then and say my mom (her daughter) made it for us to eat.


 I'm afraid that if she continues to not eat that her doctor may try to put a feeding tube in. I almost had to make that decision for my Gma because even though she would eat, she wouldn't eat a lot and she was losing weight at a rapid rate. I had to go to the assisted living center and sit with her and coax her to eat more. You may have to talk to her doctor to see what his/her recommendations are. Unfortunately, when they get it in their mind that they want to die there is not much to do. My Gma repeatedly told me that she was ready to leave and join Gpa in heaven. She had a nephrostomy tube (her kidneys were shutting down, so it's a stent to divert the urine into a bag) and she purposely pulled it out - it went in thru her back and straight into her kidney. I had to take her if for emergency replacement surgery, shortly after that her body grew toxic and she passed away.


 Thank you both so much for the replies!Yes My Grandmother believes she eats you cant convince her she doesn't!We have been there in shifts daily and still no eating!It really helps to have people to talk to that understand and can help so thank you both so much for helping!"
CLEANLINESS IN THE ELDERLY,"My mom is in assisted living, has AD, diagnosed 7 years ago and thankfully with the help of two drugs, has kept her at a moderate stage, although she does need help with bathing and dressing. I have two sisters, one is an RN and works at the facility where my mom lives but works evenings, 3 to 11. My mom has an aide that comes in to give her a shower 2 x a week, but mom refuses them. My sister makes sure to wash mom's bottom at night, and change her underwear. These refusals are becoming more and more, and now it has been over a week since she has taken a shower. I spoke to the nurse earlier and she suggested I call my mom and ask her to shower and they would go in there undress her and give her the shower even though it is already close to noon. I did call and of course, she became very nasty, told me to mind my own business and ended up hanging up on me I understand the ""moods"" of an AD patient. She lived with me for a full year. I just do not know what to do? Are any of you aware of any GOOD products on the market that I could use to ""bathe"" my mom without a shower? Is there such a thing? Or any other suggestions? I realize the elderly do not need a bath as often but over a week is too much and since she is in assisted living and we are trying to keep her there as long as possible, they will only do so much; after all, it is ""assisted"" living...and when my mom becomes stubborn, there simply isn't any changing her mind thanks so much' Miriam","Yes there are such things. Perhaps a medical supply store. In fact I know alz.org has an online store. Its like disposable giant washclothes. You just wipe like a baby wipe all over, and walla. There is even hair things where you can leave in the shampoo. Its like a shower cap with leave in shampoo.


 My Gma never made a hassle about taking her showers but one thing you can try is to use dry shampoos for her hair. thebeautybrains.com/2009/03/24/have-you-ever-heard-of-a-dry-shampoo/"
CONSTANT CRYING IN ALZHEIMER PATIENTS WITH NO  CAUSE,MY MOTHER HAS alzheimer AND LATELY SHE STRTS CRYING FOR NO REASON AND SOMETIMES FOR MANY HOURS NON STOP IS THERE SOME DRUG OR SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO STOP THIS ?.This situation is affecting her quality of live very much can anybody help me?,"Have you tried playing music she liked when she was younger? I used to working in nursing homes and music therapy was very very helpful.


 Is she on medication right now? If not, yes there are meds out there that can help stabilize her moods. My Gma would having crying spells too but once she started on Namenda, she seemed a bit better. You should talk to your mother's doctor to check what sort of medications can help her.


 SOunds probably lame, but did you ask her what was wrong? Gma does that sometimes and its because she realizes she forgets. So I make it fun saying everyone forgets, that I'm on medication that makes my forgetters work overtime, that its ok if her forgetters work overtime. Don't ask, my aunt started the ""forgetters working overtime"" and its funny but works lol. If asked why the forgetters are working overtime we respond with maybe being tired, maybe a medication, maybe just a bad day for the forgetters lol."
Now here's a thinkin question,"As you know im an in home care taker of my grandmother whom has dementia. I do this 24/7, with only doctor appointments and 3 hours break a week. Anyhow, I got an interesting scenero now, and I can use all the tips. My cancer returned, and I am on chemotherapy as of today. So how does a really sick hanging over the toilet person care for a person? Are there more programs where I can get more help? Sigh the joys of this....","My mother and sister and father only help when ""they feel"" it is needed. My mother is the best one about it and she is the one that gives me the 3 to 4 hours break but she also works full time so its hard on her to be more there for me to help her. Maybe I should call the caseworker that is with that one program and see what she says. All I know is that I will need more help than my family and I can provide while I'm sicker as a horse. Yes, I know the phrase is dog, but I changed it to horse cuz last time I was on this chemotherapy, I was in an ER 3 to 4 times a week getting iv fluids because of how dehydrated I get from all the vomiting and diaherea from this stupid chemo. After a few months I will use the normal pattern but bring up and out blood instead. It's what happened last time. Its beyond me why the doctors put me on a drug that made me bleed internal before sigh


 thanks lyn, i been real sick past feew days and my mom had to come and help me actually


 I'm sorry to hear that your cancer has come back :( I'm not sure what state you live in but here in MI we have a program that we can call for just about anything and they will be able to point us in the right direction. It's called the 411 program. Maybe see if there is something similiar in your area? Does your Gma have insurance? Will they cover visiting nurses? When I was caring for my Gma, I had my husband, son and daughter to help out. Sometimes even my mother in law would lend a hand. I also get sick a lot so it helped tremendously to have the extra hands. Is there anyone else in your family that can help out?


 There should be Respite care available.. im in Ontario n did hv chemo n was sick as well looked after mom n then dad til he passed away just after mom I believe RED CROSS is everywhere n they hv homecare that will come in as well and do things that need to be done such as dishes..laundry..meal prep ect I was a home care worker long before i was into nursing just a thought blessings lyn"
Newbie With Questions,"Hello, everyone, I have been reading posts for some time, but I have never posted. My father and step mother live w/my husband and myself. They have their own living room, bedroom and bath on one side of the house. My dad is 83, and my step-mom is 76. My step-mom's mother had Alzheimers. Grandma was a sweet, sweet woman who went from being a peacemaker to a reclusive person who became easily irritated and somewhat hostile. I'm afraid my step-mom has AD. My dad is still mentally sharp. His issues are more physical. He told me a year ago that mom might have AD, but we had to be extra careful around her now because she is ""sensitive"". He says he can't make her go to the doctor for a diagnosis. I hesitate to say this, but it is hard to distinguish between what might be AD and what is just her personality. She has never been a people person and is an abrupt communciator. Here is an example of something I found rather bizarre. I would like to know what you all think about this. I mowed the yard...we live in the country, so I mow about five acres...on a riding lawn mower and some grass ended up on this old dog house that she built years ago for some stray that showed up. It hasn't been used since, but we dare not throw it out. Mom was really ticked off. She was not happy at all that I got grass on her dog house. I saw her go out to the barnyard with a bucket of water and a cloth. She actually washed the grass off that old dog house. She was angry at me about it and was not very friedly for days. Isn't that sort of strage behaivor, even for someone who has always been a little different??? Mom has always been sort of nosey, but she is getting worse, I think. And she goes out into the garage, or the basement and moves things all around. She moves my husband's tools and then he can't find anything. She goes through my cabinets and rearranges my baking goods, etc. She doesn't do much real cooking anymore. During the week they eat leftovers, TV dinners, pizza and soup. They go to the Senior Center twice a week for lunch, so that is real food. I cook at lot on the weekends, so they eat with us. Mom also seems to not understand conversations anymore. She just doesn't seem to be able to grasp the main part of the conversations going on around her. She can't think of the right words to use either. Does this sound like a possible problem, or am I just overreacting? Thank you so much for your input. V","I agree with Snowy. She needs to get to the doctor. Trick her if you have to but if she has dementia, they have medications that can slow down the progression. Forgetting words and moving things are usually the first indications of a dementia forming.


 I wonder if you can arrange with a doctor ahead of time to pretend you are the patient describing what your husband says you do (which is really your step mother) and have her come with you. Say you need someone with you cuz you dont know if you can remember what they say.


 Thank you all for your replies. I came back to this board today, because I think Mom is getting worse. I ususally cook most, if not all, meals on the weekend. Dad wanted minute steaks for lunch today, so she had some and said she would cook lunch. That was a mistake. She can't seem to coordinate cooking more than one thing at once. We came home from church and she had not started the vegetables which take 30 minutes to steam, but the meat was already done. I walked by the oven and found it on broil. She thought she had turned it off. I have an appointment next month w/my doctor which is also her doctor. I think it is time I talk to the doctor about this. Mom sees her from time to time. I know this may be hard to believe, but I cannot make Mom do anything. She is very stubborn and gets very angry if I try to tell her anything. Then that upsets my dad who is 83 and doesn't need his blood pressure to go any higher. I guess I will start w/a talk with the doctor and hopefully she will be able to help me with advice, etc. I don't know where else to start. I have had a lot of health issues myself this year. I have chronic pain and I finally gave in and started taking the pain meds prescribed by my rheumatologist. They are helping a lot, which is great. I was barely able to function before I started taking the medication. Mom, on the other hand, has some arthritis, but she has more energy than I do. So, so strange. Thank you all again. You are very helpful, and kind, and I so appreciate your input. V


 Yes, it is a painful, confusing situation. I just want to do the best I can to help the situation as much as possible. I think they both know that there is definitely something going on now. Mom was getting really hateful at times. She is now making an obvious concerted effort to be easier to get along with. And, they are both being nicer to my husband and myself. One day at a time. Blessings, V


 You have a problem & she needs to see a Dr.....Like it or not......


 Yes, my Mom has dementia, and she moves things around all the time. My Dad was in the hospital, so she stayed with us, and she literally circled around in the guest room for hours, taking things out of her bag, folding them, putting them back in, hanging things up, then taking them and putting them back in her bag. She also blames my Dad for moving things. Also, she was a fantastic cook, but doesn't do it anymore because we finally figured out that she can't follow a recipe or remember what she put into the meal she is cooking. My Dad said things were raw and not cooked. It's a tough situation and my Mom's mental capacity is dwindling fast. My Dad's hospital stays seem to make things worse; she gets stressed and nervous. I totally agree with the above posters; get her to a doctor even though she doesn't want to go. I'm to the point now that I can't ask, I just tell them what! It's tough, but needs to be done.


 To some point I'm sure shes realizing that something is going on with her ""mentally"". For anyone getting older thats a really hard thing to admit. Their slowly losing their independence and understanding and thats a hard thing to acknowledge. Especially to love ones who know you better. I wouldn't necessarliary lie to her to get her to the doc but to maybe make her feel its YOU that needs to see the doc and you need her help for confirmation. No one likes to think that maybe its THEM with the issues but to need to ""be of help"" for someone else is much easier to accept. Reguardless of what you have to do... its a moment by moment decision. Theres no set answer or right answer for each situation. My heart goes out to you on many levels od what your doing now and what is to come. Hang in there!


 Vannie, it sounds like our situations are almost parallel. My Dad is 86, with heart ailments, and my Mom is just about at the same level as your Mom. Our Moms are both doing the very same things; moving things around and not being able to judge timing on meals. I just took over their finances because the bills were not getting paid. It's so hard to see this happening; my Mom was the rock who remembered everything! She worked in a business office and did financial bookwork. My husband's mother is much more advanced with this; to the point of not being able to put words together. The worst part of this is that my Mom is about a year behind my husband's Mom, so I can see what is coming. I suppose that it's bittersweet; I can prepare but who really wants to prepare for it.


 Gma starts fires on stoves, ovens and tries to expload things in microwaves. So... We stuck a child proof lock on the oven and microwave and hid the knobs of the stove and attach them during use only and hide them again. And if she tends to the wood stove, she leaves the door open and sets off the smoke alarm. *rolls eyes* it never ends lol"
Escorted out by Police,"Hit a new low today dealing with my inlaws. My mother in law has MCI (mild cognitive impairment) so she is forgetful in the short term. No other significant symptoms of early stage AD. She takes aricept and namenda. Her husband has become exceedingly paranoid the last 6-9 months; he is 82 and bedridden. She wanted to the locks changed on the house doors because he allows too many people to have keys and she feels threatened by the comings and goings. Before the locksmith could leave the house, the cops arrived and detained me. The siblings are all fighting, this is the 3rd incident requiring the police to be called to the house. Mom is miserable living with her husband but she is stubborn and doesn't want him to chase her from her home of more than 40 years. Two siblings feel we are doing things ""to him"" while we feel we are doing things ""for her."" There does not seem to be a way to find peace. He insists he will never move from the house. What to do???","Yes, could you explain further? Sounds like a tough situation, my heart goes out to you.


 PS - we do not live with my inlaws. my wife keeps track of things like her mom's doctor visits and regularly talks with the MDs about her condition. She fills the morning and evening pill containers and manages the prescript ions to assure there is medication on hand, however the caregivers actually hand her the pills to take. I do virtually all the grocery shopping for the household. I do other miscellaneous tasks too numerous to list for my father in law.


 Thanks Sherry. Since mom's diagnosis with MCI we have been pleading for help from the other two sisters (>2 years) They seem to be in denial. Now that mom has demanded to move out, rather than coming to her aid, they feel she is attacking dad by saying she wants to leave. So, it seems to be our perspective is what are we doing ""for"" mom and their perspective is what we are doing ""to"" dad. We are taking mom to see her psychiatrist. Hopefully he will be willing to write a letter stating that she would be better living independently rather than in the marital home where she feels abused/neglected. We would then move her into a high end Assisted Living facility within a couple miles of the house. That gives everyone the opportunity to have access to mom including her husband but it removes her from the toxic situation in which she finds herself. I'll try to keep posting. Perhaps our experience will help someone else!


 Yes, I was going to suggest moving her to a facility to get her out of the situation, and into a safer environment. Even being at a facility, they have the care and knowledge to not let the abuse happen under their roof. I found my reasonable parents have now become unreasonable with certain things; something I never thought it would come to. It's really tough with the aging; I do believe they become more paranoid and stubborn. Good luck and keep us updated.


 I'm not quite sure I understand the whole social dynamics of your family. Are you married to one of the siblings? Do you live with them (the inlaws)? What sort of things do you do to help? Why does she feel she is being chased from her home?


 Parents have 3 daughters, I am married to the youngest. The feeling she has of being chased from her home is the result of her husband being cruel and refusing to provide adequate caregiver assistance to her. For example, he requires an attendant 24x7 since he is bedridden. His overnight help is male and he will not allow her morning helper to come until very late morning when the nighttime caregive is leaving (he doesn't see why they should pay for two). Naturally she is not comfortable be assisted with dressing or bathing by a male helper. Another common problem is that he will ""hijack"" her helper even when he has one available. It seems innocuous enough, his helper calls to her helper and says hey, give me a hand for a minute. But, the result is that her helper does not reappear sometimes for 45-60 minutes. He has failed to provide for her safety in that he will not use bonded help, or even people through an agency. He will not require any application from a prospective new caregiver and simply hires them based upon his assessment of whether they have the ability to help him. ....Then the jewelry went missing We forced him to fire both helpers that had regular access to her bedroom by calling the police to file a theft report. Rather than be concerned about the missing property, he was concerned that we would pursue the matter with the INS since one of the women was illegal. He talked about the potential fine of $5000 but his jewelry loss could easily be $150K He refused to allow us to buy a safe a few years ago when we became concerned with the revolving door of helpers he had coming and going. That was before she was diagnosed with MCI. Again, too costly ($230 at Costco) He refuses to pay her medical bills for the doctor treating her for depression/MCI. The doctor stopped taking medicare and only does direct bill. He simply ignores the invoices and says she can switch or the doctor can start taking medicare again. I didn't intend to rant when I found this forum so sorry for going on and on.


 I'm at a loss. I have no words of wisdom or ideas for you, so hopefully someone else will come along with some ideas. You are in a tough situation because even though you're in the family, it's not by blood so your say won't have much impact as it would with one of the siblings. Has your wife ever tried talking to the rest of them to find out what is really going on? Are they unreasonable?


 That sounds like that would be best for all parties involved - moving mom out. I can understand her not wanting to leave but like you said, it is a toxic situation that I know must be grinding her down. No one can live in that sort of situation and come out unscathed. Please keep us updated!


 I would say while I am not a lawyer I am aware of case law on a somewhat similiar situation in Kansas's divorce court. The parties were required to split the assets equally."
Alzheimers and Lyme disease,"I had gotten bitten by a tick over 4 years ago and got treated. But 4 years later I was having trouble finishing sentences. I also statr started getting lost all the time. I would walk into my closet and not know where the things came from. I could not remember peoples faces. I could not pay my bills. I lost all interest in being social. Because I was not able to keep up and would say odd things. I would say things to people and not understand why they were mad at me. I had no fear of anything. I found alot of things very amusing that were not. I could not work anymore. I lost interst in cooking because I couldn't remember how to work my micorwave or oven, and I was cutting myself badly and not knowing it. I knew that something was wrong. My Dr. could not find anything wrong with me. I would bump into walls, like I was drunk. I would get very irritated if someone kept using the word""remember"" with me. I fet it was rude. I was going down hill fast but trying to lie and keep my ground. I did not want to lose my kids. I am a single mother with a 5 and 12 year old I fiannally admitted to my x what was going on. And gave him both of my kids. For me this was the last straw. My Dr. wanted to put me into a mental hospital because I was so depressed and he was not sure if he could trust me tobe alone in my house.... I lied and told him he could. I just turned 45 and use to have a succesful carreer. And homes all over the place. I dumped everything. I didn't care about any material things anymore. I finnaly found out that I still did in fact have lyme disease and that all of my probelms were due to a bug bite. I came out to Arizona to Envita to get treated for lyme, and all of my mental issues are now gone. it is like someone cleaned my muddy windshield off. I can see again and feel. And think. I can find my way, and got my 5 year old back. I am getting my life back. The Dr.s told me that dementia can come from lyme. and so can alzheimers. I had not know all of this before.I only knew that'I was losing my mind and my kids. But I am better now. If you or someone you love came down with all of these symptom like me, I had my blood test done at IGENEX.COM and I got my answers back. And now with the correct treatment I got my life back. best, marie","Hi, I wanted to give an update on my progress. I as I mentioned above was a mess and was going to be put into a institution. It just made no sense to me that I could have gotten so mentally ill so quickly and was going down so fast. I went to a place called Envita for a while. In Scottsdale. They were familair with all of my problems. I also learned that I could be infected by a mosquito for lyme too. So that may explain why I got so much worse over the summer. I get covered in them. I had different treatments. One was the Ozone treatement. In which they cleaned my blood pint by pint all week. Through my port. The other was a very large doses's of supplements, that I was not happy about having to take twice a day. And the other was chelation therapy. In which they get rid of all of the mercury and pesticides and whatever else my body had stored up over the last 45 years. And I got better. I am better. In is like night and day. Before I had forgoten how to drive, would get lost, and forgot people that I knew, faces and places. And I had many odd personality changes. With the lyme we get many physical problems as well. But I will not bore you with that long list. But fevers and migraines are easy to spot. I just got back from a 3 week trip with my 5 year old to Hawaii. I was able to drive about , and care for a child, and had a great time. It is all so sureal to have my mind and body back. I feel as though I have been blessed. But really the people at envita who put up with me for the 3 mos. are the ones who cured me. I was a handful to say the least. A nasty little temper and a mouth was another thing that I had...lol. and I was always right of course....stupid people....lol Kidding. I just an still in awe that I made it. So happy. Not one panic attack, and no fainting..and never got lost. And on and on. Just thought that I would share. If you know someone who always was so sharp and who now is going off of the edge...well..I was on the edge too, and I am now better. Thank god. The most important thing is that I now have my children back and my life back. My family back. And I am able to care for them and be the best mommy that I can be...again. marie


 How long were you at Envita? Are you still doing well? Are you doing any antibiotics? Thanks.


 I have just been catching up here as I have not been here for a couple of years. I would love Martha to give another update on how things are going for her.


 My two daughters got ill five years ago.Diagnosed with glanular fever, ibs, etc, wouldnt get better, couldnt go to school, became bedridden , all the time being told its chronic fatigue from virus. getting worse, one constantly nauseous, one hearing voices with unbearable head pain.I was in despair, thought they may die.Had every test going that the NHS would do (we live in UK) but nothing showed up. so I trawled internt for something or somewhere that would just test them for absolutely everything.( I was convinced they had some kind of infection to have all those symptoms and more) Then I found a place private clinic about 100 miles from where I live and took them there.They took massive amounts of blood, poo,wee the lot and I just had to wait for 4 weeks for results. It came back positive or Lyme!! What a relief to get a proper diagnosis but the fight had just begun.That was in May2009. They have been on constant different antibiotics ever since, some by injection, plus suppliments and meds for yeast overgrowth caused by the antibiotics. There was still no sign of improvement, up until the last couple of months. I was even doubting the only hope we had, but we are finally getting there after 18 months+ of treatment My youngest still cant walk, but they are now going into school 1 hour per week which I never thought would happen.Their Lyme test was sent to Igenex Labs in California. Lyme disease copies and causes so many symptoms, so get tested at a proper place, and keep on and on with meds.I wish I had known about lyme years before it had got right into their system, then it may have cleared up quicker. i hope my story can help someone.


 Thanks for sharing your heartwrenching story I am so sorry for what you have gone thru to find the answers and the TX......... Please do keep posting here and let us help you as well You are an asset to the forum IMHO Again thanks I have to admit sometimes with the fibro I feel Like I have AD I forget so easily and yes I even bump into walls YOUR story will HELP someone God Bless LYN


 I just read the stages of Atlz and I was at the high mark. I did wear my PJs to muy daughters school one day. And thought people were being silly about the whole thing. People do sort of look at me funny now. It is like they are afraid to ask me how I feel. I use to get lost coming home from my kids school two streets away from my home. I would just cruise in my golf cart till I found out where I was. I am trying to take it slow. I do not remember most of the people that I saw over and over for the last 3 years. I sort of recognize them. But I am just not wanting to work that hard on all of that social stuff right now. I have only been out of the clinic since feb 7th. I am more concerned about getting my house in order and helping my kids feel safe and secure about me again. I feel the most for my 12 year old, who went through hell with my illness. I am just now getting her back for a whole week. She is still very scared that I am not well. Or that I will slip back to being sick. I understand this. And only time will show her that I am finally back for her. My 5 year old is very clingy. And this too I understand. So she will not let me out of her sight and is always watching me. But I have proven that I can now cook and clean and drive and care for her. But I can understand how she is still vuberable. I am a single parent and for my kids to watch me go off like that. It was hell for them. My 12 year old is in therapy and has had terrible probelms with depression. This I hope to restore over time. soon. All I can do is be there for them 24/7 and do the best that I can. I know that I am up for it now. And I am just going to take it one day at a time. I am more than happy to answer any questions about my therapy or issues with anyone. Just tap on me to write to me directly. Sharing is caring.:>) marie

 Justamom, thanks for sharing your story and welcome to Healingwell! I'm sorry to hear about your daughters. You might also want to share this with others on our Lyme forum. Best wishes and I hope your daughters' continue to improve daily."
Taking mom on a trip,"I have been caring for my 86 year old mother with AD for 2 years. She is comfortable and relaxed in my home. She really doesn't have any desire to go out much, however I would like to take her on a trip to the Bahamas. She always loved the ocean , so I picture a room with a balcony overlooking the water. We would have to only leave for meals. i could read while she watched T.V while enjoying the view. Does this sound possible? The flight would be 3 hours. She is entering the moderate stage, though she sleeps and eats well and dresses herself. Thanks","Like Sherry, my mom reacts the same way. My mom use to LOVE to cruise...took them every single year for 15 years. She was extremely active, volunteering, working full time, etc. etc. Since her diagnosis, she does well in her space and really has no desire at all to leave it. If we have to take her out, she does become very stressed out and when she returns, doesn't know where she is, etc. etc. Also, it has become almost a fight to get her to leave.


 Maybe you can try taking her to a hotel for the night to see how she does?


 How very nice of you, wanting to take your mother on a trip! (Can I go instead??? j/k! lol) I don't know how your mother will react to being in different surroundings but I know with my grandmother, she did not like it at all. She was a very peaceful person but if I took her out of familiar surroundings, she lost it. You might want to ask her doctor about his/her recommendations.


 Thanks for your input. I put in a call to her doctor and am waiting to hear. I am hoping as long as we are together things will be fine. At my house she basically wants to watch t.v all day except for a weekly outing to a day program. As much as I hate the t.v, reading the guide all day and watching shows seems to give her structure . I am imagining that at the resort she can continue with the t.v but we will have an incredible view and nice meals."
Need help with prescriptions and insurance company,"Hi, I'm new to this forum. My father is in an Alzheimers wing of a care facility. He is well cared for and comfortable with his surroundings. I live in another state and am the durable Power of Attorney. My brother who lives in the my fathers city is the power of attorney for health care decisions. This arrangement has worked well however I have run into a dilemma that I am having difficulty breaking through. The facility where my father lives strictly controls the administration of his medicines and I understand why that needs to be. They get them through a pharmacy that is affiliated with the facility. My father has health insurance through his retirement from Foot Locker with United Health. This health care requires that prescript ions are obtained through the mail from Medco which is what happened for years prior to his admittance. The pharmacy said that I need to get some form of ""bypass"" from UNH or Medco but whenever I talk to someone at these companies, they act like it's the first time in history this situation has ever come up and tell me to call the other one. This has been going on for 2 years now and we have been paying out of pocket the whole time which has now gotten into the 5 figures of expenditures. The fact that I have to do this from another state adds to the frustration. I am hoping that someone here is familiar with this process and can help me get to the right people with the right phrasing of the problem.Thanks in advance.","please contact a state consumer advocate from the insurance dept or the health agency. you should have an advocate in that facility. write one letter detailing the whole situation. keep it current. send to the resident manager also.


 call the state attorney general---------------send them the detailed letter. the ag scares all businesses.


 They shouldn't be giving you the run around. When I had my Gma in assisted living, she got her prescript ions thru Medco. At first I just had them send the meds to me and I would deliver them to the AL center, however this got to be a bit much so then I switch the address to the assisted living center (with the approval of the manager) and I would order her refills online. The AL center would let me know when she was running low on medications. Try talking to the administrator of the care facility and see if there is an easier way around this. As a side note, my Gma's insurance was Blue Cross/Blue Shield provided thru my Gpa's employer (Ford Motor Co). I never had an issue with the medications.


 Thank you all for your responses. I knew there was something like an advocate...I just didn't know what it was called :)


 Also contact AARP...oftentimes they will get involved. I undestand what you are going through. The AL facility where my mom lives has the same rule"
End Stage Kidney Disease and AZ,"Hello group, My husband was just recently diagnosed with early stage AZ. He is 69 years old. His memory had started to slip slightly lately, but he had an episode that led to his being hospitalized with what they were afraid was a stroke, (negative); this led to further testing by a Neurologist and the recent diagnosis. Mike also suffers from End Stage Kidney Disease and was just about to start on dialysis when we got this new diagnosis. He was planning on doing Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) at home. His Nephrologist had been concerned about his recent memory problem interfering with his ability to do PD, but we haven't talked to her since we have this OFFICIAL diagnosis. I am wondering if anyone on this group has experience with whether this form on Dialysis is suitable for AZ patients. We had read that PD was easier/ more natural so wanted to do this instead of in center HD, but I am now concerned that he/we will not be able to do PD with the added problem of AZ. Last week before we got this diagnosis, he met with the surgeon and was going to have a cathether put in asap. If we decide not to do PD, we will need to change surgery plans and go with a fistula instead. Time is getting to be of the essence so your comments will be very much appreciated. Suzette P.S. His Neurologist has said he thinks he can go ahead with PD as planned. He has just started taking Namenda. I have yet to talk to his Nephrologist on this matter.","I'm sorry that your husband is having to go through so much. :( I do not have any answers for you, either you can wait to see if someone stops by here on the Alzheimer's forum that can help you or possibly ask this on our Kidney forum. Best wishes to you and your husband. Btw, my Gma was placed on Namenda and it helped her tremendously."
Carer stolen from my dad - advice please,Hello my dad is in a care home (i am british) and has front lobe dementia so he is lucid. I noticed that his Ipod had gone missing as he couldnt find it in his drawer a week or so since last using it. This Ipod was bought for him last christmas when we could not find his previous Ipod but was unsure if it had been stolen as he had just changed care homes. I have told the manager of the home but she is not really taking it seriously. Any advice as to what steps i can take to ensure i get recompense and/or how to stop it happening again? Any help greatly appreicated. karen.,"Thanks - yes i shall get him one - he is quite immobile as well but that sounds like i good idea - somehting he may get on with - dont know why didnt think of that. i am calling her today to chase if she has actually done much about investigating it. thanks you


 How about filing a police report--or telling the owner that you are about to? That should get their attention.


 If the manager is not taking you seriously, go over her head. Surely there is someone higher up then her? Did you search his room to be sure he just didn't hide it? One thing you can do to ensure that his things do not get stolen is to buy a lock case. If he is lucid enough to use one of these, then I recommend it. He can put his Ipod in there along with anything else of value to him.


 Sadly, theft is an issue, even in the finest of homes. My mom is at a place that is consistently rated 5 star (the highest rating given) and yet I have been frequently warned that I mustn't leave anything of value in her room. Mom use to love wearing jewelry and now I have to keep it at my house for her. She has a few rings and a necklace she keeps on, but that is it. The locked case sounds like a perfect solution, as long as your dad is lucid enough to lock it up and unlock it. I wish you well Miriam


 My fathers wing had an incidence of this happening. It turned out that one of the residents was (non-maliciously) taking things from other rooms. He didn't know what he was doing but they also discovered where a lot of the silverware had disappeared to."
Loss,"In 2009 I lost my love, my life, my everything...she suffered through early onset alzheimers...howlyncat was sympathetic to me...kind posts... it's been 2 years...i need help...i don't want to go on...alone","Howlyncat is not on HW anymore due to severe health conditions. But we are still here with you. Names change but we are all still friends to those in need. I am not quite familiar with your story, tho I think I recall reading it in the past. However, I understand the anguish of losing someone we love to this condition. I lost my Gma a year and a half ago to this horrible disease. I loved her with all my heart and I still miss her dearly. ((hugs to you Lynnie)) I understand and I care.


 Hi Lynnie, My mom has Alzheimer's, diagnosed over 8 years ago. I realize it is not the same as having the love of your life disappear right before your eyes, but in some ways I do understand. I agree with Robin. You need to speak to someone. I went into therapy, psychotherapy for the past year and it has helped me tremendously. I wish you well Miriam


 please....i'm begging...please


 Lynnie, I'm so sorry for your loss. You sound so down. Have you ever tried grief counceling? I think it may help you...many hospitals offer group seesions and sometimes churches offer it as a service. You might even want to check out the depression forum here. I stopped by this forum to check out info because of my mother-in-law. I just happened onto your post and could not ignore it. I post on the fibromyalgia forum here. Lynnie please get some help for yourself. Losing people we love is very difficult. I wish you the very best and I will put you in my prayers. Hugs, Robin


 Lynnie, how are you doing? Just checking in to see."
Aricept question,"My Mom (96 yrs old) has been suffering from fairly severe dementia for almost a year. Before that she had been declining somewhat, but it seems to have gotten pretty severe pretty quickly. Her doctor tried Aricept a few months ago and Mom had horrible diarrhea, bad enough to land her in ER. We stopped the Aricept, but now the doctor wants to try it again. My question is -- what do we hope to accomplish with this medication? Will it lessen her confusion? Or is it intended to merely stop the progression of the disease? While she was on it a few months ago, we didn't notice any benefit, although she only took it for two weeks. Second question -- does the medication actually accomplish whatever it is we're trying to do? Anyone with experience out there?","The meds for Alzheimer patients are designed to either slow down the progression or lessen confusion/emotional/aggressive tendencies. Aricept will not reverse the damage already done but it can help slow down the rate in which it's happening - perhaps even stabilize her. It takes a while to build up in the body so two weeks isn't long enough to see if this would help her. However, if she was having a bad reaction to it (diarrhea wise) then it might not be a good thing for her to be on. Have you tried asking about other medications?"
B12,Hi everyone. I wanted to share this. My Dad fell and broke his hip and he is 78 and drinks a lot of beer. He really was in bad shape and not drinking after the operation but it still seemed like he was not in his right mind. We used to blame it all on the drinking but he wasn't. the doctor told us his Dad was the same way and what improved his mental state was B12 shots. I really thought that sure was a bit of a far stretch but sure enough after a month of the shots (weekly) my Dad's mind is working so much better. And the nasty personality part went away too. He would jump down your throat if you asked what he wanted to eat. I know that isn't exactly an alzheimer symptom but he was not making sense and talking to himself and the TV. hope this is of some help,"Little that I know is B12 very good for Brain, memory.Once I told my Neurologist that I have a family history of Alzheimer's, and I too feel that I lack memory power.He asked me to have atleast 200gm of milk everyday, in any form.He also asked me to get B12 test done.Have never heard of B12 shots, probably because I didn't get the B12 test done at all.:)


 I am a firm believer for all illnesses to ask for a metabolic panel to be ran. I happened to go to a VA hospital in Ann Arbor MI because i have many issues. the Dr. there ran one and found my B12 was super low. I know you can take it in a pill but B12 is an intrinsic factor and i believe is made in your pancreas. (digging from my college brain that is froggy..) He told me the only way to build up back to a sufficient amount.... it should be above 200-900 is by injections because your body doesn't metabolize it as well. I took shots for 7 days in a row. I have mine checked about every year. It made a huge difference on my fatigue at the time. It is a simple blood test that often is over looked. But with the way people eat, we often are filled with chemicals or preservatives and are not getting quite the nutrition we need. the internal med doc i had because of my illnesses i was about 290 and he wanted me at a high range. When i got to 800 I stopped injections. Any way. Google B12 intrinsic factor. It talks about how important it is for your nervous system. I also read that it is stored in the liver, and they do sell sub lingual tablets but the best way is injections. I hope people read these because it talks a lot about how it affects Brain fog, optic nerve, (vision) and i think it just answered a lot of symptoms i have recently had that had or have been increasing. Bucci... thank you for posting.


 The only thing about B12 now, in contrast to B12 back around, say, 1976, is that every supplement I have looked at only doles it out in MICROgrams instead of milligrams. I started bodybuilding back in 1970, obviously well before the current craze. I used a balanced B vitamin, in which EVERYthing was a 50 milligram (or 100 milligram) dosage, so there was sufficient strength in it. I was pretty disgusted when I bought it earlier this year and saw that nearly every manufacturer -- including the company that I used back in 1976 -- only provides them in doses 1/1000 of what they used to. Another good one is B15, which is, unfortunately, not easily found in stores. It is called calcium pangamate. I used to use balanced B, 1200 units of E, and 100 mg of B15 before working out. I found working out easy (but then, I was around 20 as well!) and got results very quickly. B12 is an excellent energy vitamin, and I think doing a panel, as the other poster noted, is an excellent idea. It is not, however, something doctors routinely think to recommend. Most tests results simply come back ""within the 'normal' range"" which is silly, as every body is different and some need more of a mineral or vitamin and some need less."
Zyprexa for Alz/dementia?,"Has anyone on this forum ever heard of zyprexa working for people with alzheimers dementia? I am asking for a family member. I usually hang out on the auto immune and crohn's forums. I figured this would be a good group to ask if they have heard of this. My family member has an elderly grandmother who just screams at the top of her lungs for hours on end, so they put her on zyprexa..... They don't think it is helping. Thanks for any thoughts or discussion-:)","My mom was put on Seroquel, by her physician, for agitation. She was put on a very low dose and it seemed to help, but it did cause her to be drowsy. She also takes Namenda and Aricept. Miriam


 thank you for your responses!!!


 Did her doctor put her on Zyprexa? The problem with dementia or Alzheimer's is that sometimes certain medications don't work right. Zyprexa is used to treat Schizophrenia, bipolar or other psychotic disorders. The chemical make up (in the brain) of a person with AD changes. For instance, sleeping medications can cause aggression and or restlessness in a person with AD. There are other medications that can be tried to help control her outbursts. Also too, if she is taking Zyprexa with certain medications, there can be interactions. http://health.yahoo.net/goldcontent/olanzapine?brand=Zyprexa


 My wife is 70 years young and she takes Namenda two times a day they cost so much and I see no improvement. Has been on them for three years. thinking of taking her of of them."
I need to vent!!,"My sister and law and I alternate every few months, caring for my mother in law. I'm kind of at my wit's end. She REFUSES to bathe... probably because she's afraid of falling. I'm a vegetarian, so she eats hardly anything I cook. Maybe coffee, half a banana, and some cookies for the whole day. I tried buying Ensure for her, but she keeps getting thinner & thinner. She sleeps til 2, and there's not much to do here (I work from home all day, sometimes take her to bingo. Husband & I try to play Scrabble with her every night). I just see her wasting away & depressed .. and I don't know what to do. :( ------------------ These websites are not permitted per forum rules. Post Edited By Moderator (Red_34) : 3/30/2011 12:45:03 PM (GMT-6)","Honestly, it is a tough thing to see them waste away. My mother has a swallowing disorder, and she is a whopping 82 pounds. And now because of her Alzheimers, we have to remind her to drink Ensure when she can get it down. The only thing she really eats anymore is ice cream, chocolate, and a little Ensure. She never was one to take naps and now is napping all the time, and doesn't even want to get up from the corner of her couch. I'm not sure what to do at this point either so I try to keep my Dad going. How old is your m-i-law? Would she take meds? I know my Mom refuses.....


 They act up in the evenings. I,ts called sundownin. Before evening comes close curtains and turn all lights on. Play spelling games. I found my mother was very good at spelling words Like family names, where she was born and spell it!!! Who knew... I also took her outside and put her barefoot feet in the grass. In winter I stopped her wheelchair at the door, and when people walked in she got the winter air blast...and reacted to it by holding her hands up and saying whoooooooo thats cold. Well Mom with ALZ4 thats what I want you feel.....Lifes changing seasons that you are suppose to feel. the rest of your and my life...


 i tend to agree with trying to see the funny side and humour them. My grandfather had alzheimers and my grandmother in law has alzheimers, and my mum is going through the process of being diagnosed at the moment, i'm pretty sure we're going to get a diagnosis next week (she's only 57). it's very stressful for me, and i'm not looking forward to it at all because she's severely depressed and i can see that this first phase will probably be very long. But my partner seems to deal with his nanna really well by humouring her, by prompting her to repeat her funny stories from ""back in the day"" over and over again, reminding her of all the funny things. by humouring her instead of being so sad about the way she is, by the fact that she has no front teeth because she won't go to the dentist, by the fact that her hair is out of control because she won't go to the hairdresser, so when he visits, it's just a laugh, instead of sad. She is obsessed with moving back to her home town, so when we see her, he is always asking ""when are you going back to melbourne?, can I get a ride with you?"" etc. to allow her the freedom to think that there is going to be a nice trip for her in the future as opposed to more years at a nursing home. he asks her about her sewing, and she always tells us that she sewed all the kids clothes and this and that, and we just humour her and tell her she does a great job, even though she hasn't picked up a needle in years.


 I would contact the Alzheimer's Assn www.alz.org and speak to one of their counselors. I think they can direct you to the right agency for help. Yes, people with Alz also have depression, anxiety, agitation. Some become withdrawn and some go the other way and become very combative. The disease causes major confusion. My mother became very depressed and I worked with her doctor and got her on an antidepressant right away. If she does have some form of dementia, it would be good to work with a doctor that has a social worker, someone for you to talk to and possibly get your mom in too to talk to. Also, there are support groups and again, the Alz Assn should have this information for you. I hiope this helps, Miriam


 I was going to mention SUNDOWNING but it has been said. How good it was that they had a name for a specific mood. And its right on. Call Visiting nurses about their help plus others. I paid anybody I trusted $10.00 anHR. VN was paid for thru some program.


 There is more than one pill for memory loss and dementia. My mom is on Namenda and Aricept and there are certainly others. My mom has been taking the combination for 8 years and she has been stable. She is still in the moderate stage, although leaning towards the end of it. She refuses to change anything, whether it is her diet, or her schedule. I think some of it is that the need to have some control over their lives. Since they are becoming so dependent on others, they need to feel they can control something, like when they decide to bathe. It is very, very common for people with dementia to stop bathing. We can only get mom to bathe one day a week. The other days, we try to wash her privates. I wish you well, Miriam


 Thanks for the info - wish I would have had it for my late husband, father, mother and mil. Drs. do seem to only want to use manufactured drugs and not even give nature a chance. Will pass this info on to other caregivers.


 Is she on medication?


 You need to find caregiver help in your town. I' 53 and the accident baby. I cared for my mom till she died of ALZ 7 years ago. Then My dad ..my best friend, got to be 89. His last year was horrible with singles. My relatives would say... you know why your dad is still alive don't you? I knew he was here for me. That part of telling them it's OK to go and I will be OK. is the famous last words they need to hear and I needed them to hear me say!!!! It was time for us both. Them are the words are loved ones want to hear. IT'S OK TO GO...WE WILL BE FINE. YOU'VE TAUGHT US HOW TO SURVIVE BY WATCHING AND LISTENING AND LOVING YOU BEING YOU!


 hi,my nanny had dementia,luckily for all the family she was the sweetest thing ever. Up until she had to go into a facility, she lived on her own and would walk outside in a city near Newark,NJ. not to safe until one night by a miracle, was found on the steps of elizabeth general hosp.with a broken shoulder. From there we all pitched in to try and take care of her. But it was hard. I would visit with my children, when we could take her out for walks or lunch. And luckily my cousin was a nurse at the nursing home where she did die at.If you have a loved one who has to be in a facility my advice to you is.Make sure you drop by at all times. I know how difficult it is to say goodbye to someone who doesn't even remember your name. One day my grandmother asked me if I say that flying horse outside her window. I said sure Nan, it's a unicorn.What can we do but try and make them as comfortable as possible. With love and compassion.Patience, patience and more patience.Don't try and take on the responsibility alone. It's really taxing on your nerves never mind your physical well being. My advice, if you can medicate her with moods or appetite go for it. What else do you have to loose. good luck, i live with my mom who is 82 and starting to show signs of dementia. It's really nerve racking. I'm sick with polymyositis. So stress ofsets my pain, and my mental health, well, I see my shrink on thursday thank god. good luck to all. remember your not alone.peace and love to all. sue


 Hi all, i've posted before on this site. Thanx to all that replied. I was wondering how do i go about having my mom checked out for early signs of dementia. She is begining to get really combative, angry, miserable. the smallest things will set her off. She's a recovering alcoholic, so medication is really hard to suggest. She thinks she'll be on dope as she calls anything but tylenol dope.It's a very difficult situation. I had to come and live with her in oct/09.I have polymysotis.An autoimmune disease. I've been on an uphill climb, but stress hits me like a ton of bricks. There is so much tension between us that the dog even has the runs. Our communication skills are not the best. She's a screamer, controlling and very jealous.Every day is a battle. I've sat her down several times and tried to convey my feelings.Needing boundries.My privacy.And demand respect.She's always interupting me when i'm on the phone,or if i'm at neighbors house's she'll come looking for me and cause a scene. We use to have a good relationship over the phone, but now that i live with her it's a whole new ball game. She treats me as if i'm 5. She wants me to be on call 24/7. I have to ask permission to give the dog a treat!!!!!Now that i've lost the prendisone puff and took off 30lbs. Befriended a few women in the complex, have gone out a few times. omg... she's soooo mad, jealous,judgemental and cruel.After being in a 12step program for over 15years you'd think she would have some serenity. Which leads me to believe that alcohol only masked her problem. I truely believe she needs an antidepressant.But how do i go about telling her that???Do i go behind her back and call her doctor?she is so tightly wound up. Such rage and meaness. It's so hard to be nice to her when she's so verbally abusive to me.Is that a sign of dementia???I recently read an article about vitamin B12 helping. I'm wondering about her arteries to her brain. Every day she is complaining about migraine headaches. She was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure.She just is miserable. She has said such mean cruel abusive things to me and then forgets.Or maybe she doesn't but is lying.Sometimes i hear her talking to an AA buddy and can't believe what i hear. Just lie after lie after lie.....I'll approach her and she'll just laugh it off while i'm crying my eyes out.She resents me living with her, she wants to throw me out. But i've lost everything and gave all my things to my daughter who lives 3,000 miles away.I've got nothing or nowhere else to go.I hate living here as much as she hates me here. I can't do enough to please her. Garden, cook, laundry,shop, cook, clean, nothing is enough.I'm at a loss here.The stress is over the top.And it really hurts to be abused by my mother who should be my best support system.I'm very vulnerable, cry, depressed, scared, not sure of my future,still on meds for my disease.Not being able to take care of myself financially. I waitressed all my life so i can not do that line of work anymore. The little bit of SSD i get would not allow me to live on my own.Gave my car to my daughter. My credit has gone down the drain, when i became ill, i was unable to keep up with my credit.I can handle all of that, but the only thing i can't handle is her. Does anyone have any suggestions????I'm at such a loss of resources.My depression has escalated and stress will enable the immune to come back. Don't know what to do. Can anyone relate?????Please help if so. Thanx for listening it does help to get it out....sue


 I agree that you need to talk to someone but it sounds like she may have more then possible dementia but another form of mental illness for example Schizophrenia or BiPolar. She may even have something really wrong with her brain. Has she ever had a MRI of her brain? If not, I highly recommend she have one - if not to rule out conditions (brain tumors or aneurysms can cause migraines and aggressive behavior) but to see if plaques can be found. Someone with AZ MAY have plaque formations on the brain (but not always). Was she this bad when you were a child? If this is fairly new then she should be checked out. The first place to start is her doctor, he/she will not be able to discuss her case with you but you can voice your concern. When my Gma got dementia, I called her doctor. Luckily he is a geriatric doctor and had access to many social workers and other resources.


 There is only one pill that I know of that you must start them on as early as diagnosed. ARACEPT...


 I would agree with MT lady. As I posted in another post today, I also gave my mother Namenda (the actual non-generic name is Memantine) back in 2003, when I saw an article in the New York Times. Memantine (Namenda) was not available in the US, and one had to get a doctor's prescript ion, fax it to a company, and they got it overseas. At that point, it cost $550 for a 90 day prescript ion. It sure worked well. I was taking mom to daycare, and told the nurses to watch her. After -- literally -- 10 days, the nurse (who was older than my mom, who was 79 at that point), asked if I was giving her ""that drug."" When I asked why she was asking, and did she see an improvement, she emphatically replied, ""YES!"" Mom was apparently very lively again. The memantine, in my mom's case, worked for around 6 months. I noticed a falloff in its effects after that. I had insisted to the doctor that I wanted combination therapy, Aricept and Memantine together. He resisted, but we made a deal that if she hadn't improved in 90 days, I would give her the medication he wanted to try. That never happened, since the Memantine worked. However, synthetics cannot penetrate the blood/brain barrier, where all the ""sludge"" is slowly covering the nerve endings, so they cannot communicate with each other. I found Turmeric (sold in health food stores) actually restored partial memory, but even more, her self-awareness (a sense of appropriate behaviour , like whether she had made a fool of herself when the pastor came over to give her communion one time). Since I'm a gay man who lived in San Francisco from the early 70s until 2002, and had had nearly all of my friends die of AIDS, and develop dementia at one point or another, I had a lot of experience in gauging how bad their dementia was (we used to ask them to name their mother, father, sisters and brothers and ask math questions, like what's 10 x 5, in order to gauge when they could no longer answer those questions and were deteriorating further). Turmeric, if you look at studies, has been offered as a way of slowing deterioration, and, as I mentioned in my other post, it DOES penetrate the blood/brain barrier, since it's a natural substance. It seemed to almost act as a ""detergent"", maybe by scrubbing the sludge off the synapses. Even my brother, who is slightly mentally slow, noticed that mom seemed more alert (although I initially told him he wouldn't see any results for 30 days, just to throw him off. I didn't want to influence anything he saw. After about 8 or 9 days, he came to me and said, ""I know you said we wouldn't see anything for at least 30 days, but..."" I had noticed it too, and knew that my mother showed signs of improvement on the Memantine after 8 days as well, but he wasn't around then). I am highly disgusted (and wrote the New York Times two days ago), about the fact that doctors won't suggest natural (aka ""homeopathic) remedies, since they have not done enough ""studies."" I wasn't going to have my mom deteriorate just because they'd rather give her drugs than suggest anything natural. I had taken an Alzheimer's training course when I moved back here (East Coast) from San Francisco in 2002, and asked the doctors at the Alzheimer's training sessions why they didn't recommend ginko (at that point, turmeric had not been known to help in slowing down the progression of Alzheimers). Their response? ""Well, we can't be sure of the quality of it."" Anyone who was an AIDS caregiver knew that ginko, as well as vitamin E, only worked in LARGE doses, not small ones. Again, I thought this dumb: our parents and relatives are dying and they're worried about a NATURAL substance that doesn't kill off the vitamins in the body (have no doubt about it: man-made drugs use up vitamin B and other vitamins in your body to process themselves through your system). I was completely disgusted earlier this year, when doctors proclaimed ginko had no effects. I thought they were completely moronic. In the AIDS crisis, we all figured out -- long before AZT, and we were the ones telling the doctors things we'd found worked (vitmain E in large doses [ 1200 mg or higher -- E is an anti-oxidant and provides oxygen to the brain. It also works great if you're a runner or work out. You'd notice you're much less fatigued]) and ginko IN LARGE DOSES, meaning 1000 mg or higher. Small doses of ginko don't work at all, and the doctors used 250mg in their tests. I was completely frustrated that they didn't have to sense to consult people, such as those of us who were caretakers in the 80s and had a network where we consulted each other about what remedies so-and-so was receiving and did it work about this. All of us knew it worked only in large doses, and wish I knew who to write to about that study, so I could verbally lambaste them for such idiocy. Turmeric works, as I said in my other post, but has the side effect of causing constipation after a few months. Big deal. I'd rather have a mother (and she was at Stage 5, out of 7 stages of Alzheimers) who got back some of her memory and who knew when she was demonstrating inappropriate behaviour (well, to HER it was inappropriate, such as making a fool of herself in a public place or when the pastor came over to give her communion), then wait for them to find a cure. Besides, neither ginko nor turmeric can harm the person, although it's a good idea to observe them and give them a series of questions to answer, so you can tell if they're becoming more forgetful. I asked mom to name her 10 brothers and sisters and asked math questions (she helped people do tax returns, so it was easy to ask ""how much is 10 x10"" or ""What's 12 divided by 100, to which she replied, 'Glen, you can't divide 12 by 100"" so I replied, ""Fine, what's 100 divided by 12?"" She was able to say ""8..."" and couldn't remember the fractionalized portion of it. Pretty good for doing it in your head at stage 5 of Alzheimers. I do realize some people's relatives become violent: my mom did not, and she remembered who I was until the end -- when she had a stroke. Anyway, enough babling. Germany used Memantine (Namenda) for 20 years for dementia (I can't remember if it was for vascular dementia or another form), but as MT lady mentions, it works. I gave mom the Aricept, Namenda AND the turmeric all at the same time (the turmeric I would give her 300 mg 3 x a day = 900mg). If you want to try the drugs first, do the combination theory, but I beg of you to at least TRY the turmeric for a month or so. The constipation doesn't set in that quickly and, unless they have an allergy to it, it does help. Look up information on the 'Net. I just wonder how long it will be before we understand that Nature does the best job of healing our bodies. I also wonder when medical professionals will open their minds and not be afraid of lawsuits if suggesting natural drugs for Alzheimers. They may be avoiding lawsuits but meanwhile our loved ones are sinking deeper and deeper into madness. As a survivor of the AIDS crisis (I never got it), Alzheimer's is, to me, a ""repeat"" of a war I've already been through once, and experience being the best teacher, I found vitamins and natural substances working surprisingly well.

tips on dealing with halucinating,what is recommended?,"what is recommended when the patient is originating responses to visual and/or auditory halucinations?


 Hi, My father was an Alzheimer's patient.Usually in late evenings, he used to get terrified visualizing that somebody is trying to harm/hit him.He used to look at the door and start shouting, sometimes uncontrollable.we noticed that this mostly happened if he woke up late in evening after a post lunch nap.So, we used to schedule his day so that he doesn't sleep till evening, or we used to keep him away from the front door of the house, used to keep him engaged elsewhere.Sometimes, it worked, sometimes didn't. I remember such incident that happened when I was around, I had to hold my father tightly but lovingly, was telling him constantly and assuring that I am with you, I am your daughter and no one can harm you.Then we cajoled him to come inside, made him lie down, hold his hand and I asked my mom to bring some new topic or sing any old songs that he liked.Then I asked him if he remembers the line, and he could sing most of the lines.Soon he was better. Later on, when he caught up Parkinson's, his hallucinations were severe and of different nature.Those could only be moderated with help of medicine.Those are painful, and those not let my father sleep even.It was in later stages of PD.I wish your loved one doesn't have to go through it.


 Can you expand on the circumstance please?


 If the person has Alzheimer's there may be medication they can take to help calm them down but hallucinations aren't ""typical"" of AZ manifestation. It can happen but usually not until the middle to end stage. If the Alzheimer's sufferer is on pain medication, this can increase hallucinations. However, the best thing would be to discuss this with their doctor to find something that may help.


 Come on moderators, your dizzy is back! And does this remind you of my problem or what???? 1. call doctor 2. Let him have his hallicuation. do not approach, they can and will get violent, including the small skinny fragile looking ones (i got physical evidence on me too lol) 3. Not sleeping/days and nights mixed up = sun downers 4. have a evaluation done, it seems a med adjustment needs to happen (yea red im actually saying it) 5. do not hesitate to talk to us, especially red or me (hehehe love ya red)"
Red!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I havent been on in awhile, so I thought I'd log on and torture... I mean talk to you How have you been? Did I remember to tell you we put Grandma in a home? I actually like the facility too. I've been very sick lately. Including, trying to kick the bucket. Go figure, it isnt the brain tumor that tries to get me... but being ""put under"" (cant spell that word, starts with a) (the word when a doctor makes you sleep in lala land while you have surgery) . I have to be put under for MRIs cuz I am clasterphobic. I went for my MRI in Late July, and went into ICU while scaring my mom (and you know that is actually hard to do). I dont remember much, but I remember waking up and having a chaplain in my room. Next I know I'm in ICU, and having stuff on me everywhere, including oxygen. I needed 5% oxygen for awhile. I also had low blood pressure, tachy heart (heart too fast) @ 158. I still have my heart issues, but that is all. I am now on heart meds. But the good news is both (coughs yes, i found out earlier this year a second) brain tumors are trying to shrink and they expect i may go in remission soon. lets turn that may into a yes And my man and I broke up last week. we were together 9 years. So whats going on with you? I sure hope it isnt as bad as mine","oh i do got a story to tell you. grandma got real bad. remember how she kept attacking me? well one time she got me corned and attacked me like crazy, hit, bit, strangled, pinched, punched, pulled hair, even tried to pull my pic line out. Still going after 20 minutes. I took my cell phone out of my pocket and dialed 911 and shoved it back in my pocket. i just kept saying ""grandma stop doing __ (whatever she was doing)"" ""grandma you are hurting me ""grandma you have alheimers"" ""grandma you live at ___"" and it worked... the police and medics came out. she attacked a police officer (boy am i glad i declared alheimers cuz he just took it liek i did when it could of been worse). The police talked her into going into the hospital by saying she can get away from me. she attacked the people in the hospital... and won a free trip to the physc ward... where.. you guessed it, what you said all along that needed to happen, a med adjustment happened. My mom decided to wake up and smell the coffee then and realized how much I was litterly bending over backwards doing 24/7 care with her. she decided to put grandma in a home but let me pick where cuz she knew i used to work in a nursing home and i dont want her in any kind of home except the best. her new medication is great! she knows who i am, and says she loves me! i even offered with the new meds to continue care, but mom chose a home. Masahiro has done a lot of changing, it seems like I dont know him anymore. I love him, and I always will. He's became very rude, undermeaning, and more. Its hard to get him to listen, to talk without starting a fight. He and I are remaining friends. In fact, when I had to be with him (hes a bus driver and by chance i had to take that bus to go to a doctor appointment) he was acting like his old self. so i told him while he was in himself that hes changed a lot and he hurt me (he basically would imply im trash), and we actually agreed on things. He wanted to break up, but I talked him into staying friends because I love him and I also know that deep down this is not him and taht he cares somewhere. He is a bit older than me, 14 years, so I think I'm not sure, that he may be having a mid life crisis. I dont know what to do.. But so far I've know you've had great advice about everythign! He and I have been together 9 years, and I really dont wanna lose him. Hes my life, my love. In fact he and I share a connection, that has to be love. We can know things without saying it - right down to me sleeping while he is working and me waking and calling and saying ""whats wrong? what happened honey?"" and him saying ""i was going to wait cuz you were sleeping."" i know what we have is real, i just do not know what to do. he broke it off weith me, saying he didnt want to talk to me, changed his number, didnt want to see me ever again. since i had to take his bus to a doctor appointment, i did manage to talk him into at least being a friend still.


 Yes, Masahiro is his name. He is Japanese. I really dont know what got to him, he wont talk. How can we work on an issue if he wont say what it is? I do love him though, and I think deep down he does too.


 I will try... and see you did have advice!


 Hi there Smurfy :) No, you didn't mention that you had to put your gma in a home. It's good that you found a home that you like - that is one of the most important steps I believe. How does she like it? You definitely have been thru the wringer haven't you??? But great news that the tumors are shrinking! I hope that up trend continues :) I'm sorry to hear about the break up with your guy. Was it mutual? My health has gotten better. I started on a new medication for my Ulcerative colitis called Remicade. It's an infusion that I get from an IV at a hospital. I've only had one infusion (next one is on next Wed) but so far it seems to be working pretty darn good! :) I also had to have hand surgery. I was a bit hit or miss MIA here on HW. I had trigger finger so I had surgery to cut my tendon sheath but I found out that my tendon was fraying too. I had that done in July and I am back to pretty much normal. My hand still gets stiff but I expect it will get better and better. But overall I would have to say your story beats mine! lol


 I'm glad to hear that your mother finally stepped up to the plate and helped you. I know what it's like to take on the burden of caring for someone with AD or dementia. I had my husband to help as well as my kids but I had the sole responsibility (my brothers were useless) to care for my gma. Luckily, she never got violent like yours did (she was a gentle soul). I'm also glad to hear that she is now doing better. Regarding the med adjustment, sometimes when you are seeing things too closely you forget about the big picture. Masahiro (that's his name yes?) may be just running from the fact that you've been so sick? I know that it's hard for a loved one to understand a chronic illness and that they can feel pretty useless and impotent in the face of it. Perhaps, causing them to get angry and lash out. I'm just guessing at that tho because I don't know the whole dynamic of your relationship.


 I wished I could give you some advice on what to do with Masahiro. But I am not the best to go to for that. I've been with the same man for 24 years and never had issues...happily married for 22 years. So maybe just give him time and space??? Maybe he will open up when he's ready?"

How to help neighbour...,"I grew up down the street from a couple I call Granny & Granddad. They are not my grandparents but growing up I spent a lot of time at their house visiting my friend, their granddaughter, who lived with them. So their names just stuck. I haven't seen them as often as I would like in recent years but I hear from their granddaughter that they're not doing very well. Granddad has what the family thinks in dementia. He doesn't remember how the TV works, how to clean himself after using the washroom or who his great grandkids are, etc. Granny is too scared to leave him alone and doesn't leave the house anymore. My friend says that when she visits Granny, she cries. Their family doctor has applied for them to get help from a government program but nothing has come of it. This couple has 6 children and 6 grandkids, and everyone is shrugging their shoulders at the situation. One of the sons does live with them but it sounds like he is overwhelmed. I want to help. I want to go down to the local office and report what's going on. It's ridiculous to me that 2 people who gave so much to their family in their prime are being left to live like this. What can I do?","Thanks for your reply. I've asked the granddaughter why someone doesn't go down to the government office and get answers. It all comes down to finger pointing. They say the son who lives there doesn't do enough. They're not my family and I shouldn't pass judgment, but I'm worried about them. I might go down to the office myself next week and see what I can do, without stepping on toes. Thanks again.


 That is so sweet that you want to help this couple! I applaud you for that :) Is there anyway for your friend, the grand daughter, to ask about to see if the family is willing to help out? I mean you can always go over there and offer help as much as you can but ultimately it is up to the family to do something about it. Even though you grew up down the street from them, you are still an ""outsider"" and unfortunately, as much as your heart is in the right place, this is a family matter. HOWEVER, if you think that this Grand-dad is being neglected or abused than you should step in and contact the proper authorities.


 minou, You can call your local adult protective services and report them as possible vulnerable adults. All adults should be able to live free from fear or harm and have their rights and choices respected. I commend you for wanting to do something to help this couple. Kindly, Kitt"
I need to help my mom,"My mom has end stage liver cancer. Her biggest worry is my dad. She cannot rest peacefully until we figure out what is going on with him. She thinks he might have beginning alz. so I thought I might ask you guys. He says nothing is wrong and wont go to the doctor. I live in another state so I dont see the symptoms my mom and sisters see on a regular basis. He is 61 years old and his main problem is memory related. He doesn't remember what people tell him from day to day. For ex. my mom has a lot of hip pain from her cancer and it hurts her much less if she can get up herself. She has told my dad over and over to not help her because it makes it hurt more. He does it every day. When they drive somewhere he forgets the order of errands they were doing...Walmat, Sams club and the grocery store. He turns to go to the grocery store when they were close to their 2nd stop at Sams club. There were other things but I cant remember them all over the past two years this has been happening (yes I see the irony lol) He has also had a few issues of raging incidents over the past 2 years. He gets really mad at something and yells and paces around the house. My mom can calm him down eventually. Yesterday he threw a chair out of the bathroom into their bedroom hard enough to bend the metal chair. This is so very unlike my dad! So what are your thoughts?","Thank you Kate. He doesnt drink but I never even thought about that. My mom feels safe so no problem there. Is there a difference between dementia and Alzheimers?


 He is on medications. I will tell my mom to mention that if she can get him to go to the doctor. Thanks for your reply and concern


 Social services can assist. They even can get a home nurse or doctor to observe


 Forgot to mention he doesnt do the typical things an alz. person might do like putting keys in the cabinet or forgetting what keys are for.


 Odd that you mentioned tbe vascular dementia caused by mini strokes. My dad has had heart issues. His heart races to double the normal rate. I wonder if that could cause what you talking about .


 Does he have any breathing issues? copd ..That can cause the heart to race.


 Social services can assist. They even can get a home nurse or doctor to observe"
Alzheimers a side effect of statins,"My mother has apparently been a victim of drug side effects. She was on cholesterol-lowering meds for years, and now I find out they are responsible for her memory loss. I just wonder how many are going through what we are going through with parents that have memory problems, and I wonder how many might possibly improve at least a little if they were to stop those meds. I sincerely urge any of you that are either on statins yourselves or have parents that are on them to check out spacedoc.com and get educated about what these drugs can to do your brain. It is sickening to realize that the medical profession continues to push this stuff onto an unsuspecting population. Mom is in the Alzheimer's unit in a care center because of this stuff, and now I find out that statins are also to blame for the muscle damage she sustained that now has her wheelchair bound.","Interestingly, there seems to be as much literature about how statins prevent alzheimers as there is about them causing it. Looks like everyone is still guessing at this point."
How early Can someone get Alzheimer's?,"My mother is 58 going on 59. She was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's because of recent traits she has been displaying (I.E being later then normal for things, forgetting the little things like her keys, cell phone and getting frustrated and mad, getting lost in same town that she has lived in all her life). I live 1500+ miles away from her and I have a sister who lives 2 miles away. My sister wants me to give up everything, including my partner and job, here in Seattle and move home to So Dakota to take care of my mother. Why does she think this is fair? Should I? Is it a fair compramise to have my sister take care of my mother and me handle the legal/Finicial aspects of this for her? Also what can I do to prepare myself with this? I have never known anyone with Alzheimer's.","I wanted to let everyone know of an update. I have contacted DSS in my hometown to get her the help that I know she is going to need. It was a hard decision but I had to do it. As far as my sister. Her excuse is simply I don't have time. How do you have time for your own Mother? I even let her know that i could take care of the admin(paying bills and ect) for her.


 One more thing I forgot to mention to you -- I would not expect my sisters or brother to drop their lives and move here to take care of Mom and Dad. Nor would my husband's brother expect him to move back to Philly to take care of his parents. We do the best we can with our situations. Take care and hope things work out for you.


 I think that that is a very good compromise. Aging parents are difficult. Alzhimer's is a different ball game. No childshould be left to carry the weight, but you don't have to up rot your life either. That may only lead to anger and resentmeant toward both your sister and parent, and derease the quality of care they recieve. With my grandfather on my mother's side her sister in Maryland take care of the leagal and paper details while my mother takes care of appointments and general care and my cousin does meals, medications and day to day. Your sister may need medical transport to take him to appointment or consider an adult daycare. Alzhimer's is taxing and you don't want your sister to burn out either. Visit as mcuh as possible so that your mother will remember who you are. Somehting I am sure you want but will make taking care fo her when you are around easier. It is hard to gauge where the disease will take you next or how fast the trip. Good luck.


 You're in a tough situation especially because you live so far away. No one can really tell you what to do, you have to decide for yourself. If your sister is taking care of your mother alone, with no support structure, it is going to be hard on her. Being a care taker is rough. But perhaps you can make a compromise with her somehow. As for being prepared - that are so many different manifestations of Alzheimer's. It can remain mild with only a few memory issues or it can progress rapidly to where she will not be able to feed herself or recognize who you are. No one can say for sure how this will progress. But one thing that is extremely important is to let your mother know you love her. I suggest you read up on everything you find on the internet about AD. The more you know, the more you will feel in control. AD is very turbulent and can be rough not only on the person it affects but those around them.


 You were right to find some help for her. But please know that your sister is right too; it's not that she doesn't want to take care of your Mom -- it's just very time consuming and difficult especially when you are trying to take care of your own life stuff. My siblings all live about 2 1/2 hours away, so I'm left to care for both of my ailing parents (Mom has Alzheimer's) and at this point, I have no sick time left because I've been running to help them. The whole family agreed when my Dad broke the femur in his arm last year to find 24 hour care rather than place him in a skilled facility. THat's when we found out my Mom's memory was failing. I've had this service now for over a year and at a minute's notice they have been able to adjust hours to meet my parent's needs. Now they are down to 8 hours every day so someone can bathe my Mom and feed my parents, grocery shop, etc. I'm there as much as I can be, but I do hold down a full time job, and have a family to take care of as well. Plus my job requires travel. And I take care of paying their bills too! Try to work out things as a family and it will be better for your Mother. My husband is back on the east coast right now trying to do the same thing. Work together...it makes life much easier for everyone.


 Perhaps you can move mom to you? There are also programs through DHS where she can have in home care


 I have worked with Alzheimer's patients that were far more advanced then your descript ion at an earler age.. My father died from the disease but he seemed to progress very slowly till the end.. He died at age 84. For probably 10-15 years before this I believe he had it but he was trying to hide it.. In the end it was sad.. I sat by his bedside and he kept trying to get me to leave because he didnt know me.. Its a heartbreaking illness.. I wish you the best.."
Don't know what to do about my dad,"Hi, I need help so any suggestions will be helpful. My dad has had a very mild form of alzheimer's for several years. He was living on his own in a senior apartment building in so. CA for 9 years. Before that he lived in Vegas. Well, about 1 and 1/2 weeks ago my dad told the apartment manager he was leaving and he got in his truck and drove to Las Vegas (even though he usually doesn't drive). He checked himself into Circus Circus. He was acting irratically and security ended up sending him to the veteran's hospital for observation. They let him out after 3 days and he went back to Circus Circus. Then, a few days later, he started acting weird again and the police called me to tell me he was acting disoriented. The problem is he has been independent. I don't have any legal authority over him. When I talked to him on the phone he refused to go anywhere with me. He is a big man with a bad temper. There is no wayI could force him. He has left his apartment. They don't want him back as he was making threats before he left. He is a veteran. I have called several gov. agencies but have gotten nowhere. They just tell me to call adult protective services. I have no where to put him . He can't stay with me as I have diabetes and a knee problem and can't take care of him. I can't afford to put him in a nursing home on my own. I don't know what to do.","You may want to try giving your father turmeric. I moved from the West Coast to the East Coast 9 years ago, because my mother reached the point where her Alzheimers had progressed to her not being able to live alone. I gave her Aricept and then, in 2003, Memantine when it was not yet available in the US and one had to get a doctor's prescript ion and then get it from overseas. It is the standard combination therapy now, although far too many doctors still just use Aricept. In late 2004, my then boyfriend told me about listening to NPR and they noted that Turmeric was being recommended. China and India have the lowest rate of Alzheimers and it was traced to the consumption of Turmeric in the diet. I got some and gave it to my mother, who became noticeably more alert in a rather short period of time (I noticed, when I gave her Memantine, she improved within 8 days. That turned out to the standard time I could see improvements for her). Newsweek published a story on Alzheimers in the April 2005 issue, where the research specialist noted that the drug companies, after she issued a statement about turmeric, approached her and asked if she was trying to ""put them out of business."" By that point, mom had been using it for 4 months and, considering she was at stage 5, demonstrated a return of partial memory (she remembered events that happened a month ago), but more strikingly, a sense of appropriate behaviour (""Did I make a fool of myself when the pastor came over?"" was her question to me one time). Doctor's don't recommend anything that's not in drug form, but if you decide to try it, be aware that it can cause constipation after prolonged use, something another friend, who was 80, also mentioned to me after I recommended it to him. He was worried he was losing his memory. He said the turmeric helped, but he stopped using it because it caused constipation. I thought, so you'd rather lose your memory again than take something for the constipation, but that was his choice, so... If you decide to buy it (health food stores sell it), make SURE it says it is 95% curcuminoids on the bottle. I use it for arthritis, by the way, and it works well for that. I'm 60. There are no other side effects, by the way. If you try it, you need to give him 900mg a day or even 1200mg. I had taken care of all my friends with AIDS prior to this, so I'm very aware of what doses work. If it had been known that this worked during the AIDS crisis, maybe we could have avoided the dementia so many of our friends developed. It DOES work, but sadly, people don't realize that synthetic drugs -- Aricept, Memantine (which is also very good) can't penetrate the blood/brain barrier, and consequently, cannot get in to ""scrub"" the sludge that coats the nerve endings and thereby prevent the electrical impulses to ""jump"" from one nerve ending to the next one, but Turmeric is a natural ingredient, and the body does not prevent it from entering the brain, which is where the damage is being done. I can't, obviously, force anyone to try it, but my experience is that it shows results faster than synthetics, and if you give it to him for a month, and he doesn't show any signs of improvement, there is no harm done (as I said, the constipation doesn't seem to start for a few months). Good Luck.


 you can call dhs for elderly. there are programs at home where a nurse/cna/so can can be with him. further ado, i think he needs mediciation. you should try talk to his doctor


 I haven't been here in a few years,not much new about AD.I still take Galantamine(Razadyne)still doing very well according to my neuro......It will be 14 yrs.in Dec.since I was diagnosed.........I'm in a wheelchair now,due to COPD,so I just wheel everyplace........


 Did you actually call adult protective services? They might be able to offer you more suggestions. Something is ringing in my head right now - past mentions - so please forgive me if I get this wrong. But it seems that if a person is a threat to themselves and to society (such as driving), you can have your father picked up and tested by a psychologist to determine if he is responsible for his own well being or unable to care for himself. This is a rather drastic step tho. Where is he staying now?


 Has anything been helpful? Please keep us updated. We have been where you are at now, It does suck. But .......you will look back and if you listen to us will not regret not doing what we advise. I feel like like an expert advise 0person because my mom died of ALZ 4 and dad was taken down with shingles cause I had his last 9 teeth removed not knowin he shoud of been on antibiotics before the surgery. Whatever............


 mcbrion, do you just give the tumeric in a powder form with some water Or how???


 On this web site http://www.orbiclinic.com/news/ # I found very interesting article about Alzheimier's diseas."
children,My mom and I where planning on taking my 4 year old daughter on a trip to see my grandpa next week. Tickets bought and everything. My uncle says we need to not come see him because my grandpa cant handle a 4 year old. I heard that children where good for people with Alzheimer's. Is this true or false?

 My father could not handle children at all. Some in his care unit loved them but my Dad was they worst and I had to stop my children from visiting him. I wanted their memories to be good of my Dad. My sister did not choose the same and her daughter unfortunately has terrible memories of my Dad. That is tough and if your uncle is around him on a regular basis I personally would trust his instincts.


 I can only speak from the respect that I was an activity director at an assisted living facility and an occupational therapist working in geriatrics. Typically we encouraged visits from young visitors to our residents. You dont mention the extent or living situation so its hard to say. The residents very much enjoyed visits from children playing simple games, coloring and similiar activities. Has your uncle mentioned exactly why he thinks its not a good idea? Just wanted to mention that it is very hard on older children that had a significant relationship with the person. They expect the person to remember them and when they dont its very upsetting. I understand your son is younger, but just for anyone else reading. It can be quite tramatic.


 Some love it some don't. Perhaps its your uncle that doesn't want them around. What I'd suggest is getting a near by hotel and only going for an hour to your fathers to see how it goes, then give both of them a break. Try an hour and half the next day and watch to see if your dad gets agitated. Remember, they can get violent during ""bad"" moments."
i have some questions regarding alzheimers and memory loss.,"Hi Everyone, My grandmother is 91. A few years ago she starting forgetting things. Example... If she turned the heat down or turned the stove off. Its now at the point shes not remembering if she turned the heat on 40 times a day, or asks whats for dinner every 10 minutes thru the day. Its her saying oh your here after she wakes from a nap. when my moms been there for 4 hours. its her thinking other people are someone else. Its grammy thinking she already ate whens she didnt. The question I have is, is this Alzheimers or dementia? My family is in denile that its just memory loss. I think its much more than that. I knew a woman at the age of 99 who had no memory issues at all. I'm just concerned. No one is listening to me in my family to get her checked out further and my youngest aunt is the caregiver to my grandmother and she lives with her and its getting worse and worse. Thanks for any advice... Donna","hi sherry, thank you so much for your information its just hard to see her like that. she always said once her mind started to go then she wanted to go to heaven. i wish her wish came true for her. she is ready but god keeps her here. i'm blessed to still have my grammy. i love her so much. getting older and seeing ones you love get older its tough to handle at times. thanks again for writting me


 Hi Lonie, My sister always has my grandmother tell stories of the past and she'll remember them like it was yesterday Its so wonderful to hear the stories and it makes her so happy. I just adore and love her much, hard to see her like this. I'm taking in all the advice and possitive thoughts Thank you for writing me


 Hi, I dont know anyone with alzheimers personaly, but found cures for many things. Aluminum has been found in blood with alzheimers, this means you have to detox the body.herbal Liver and kidney cleanse. Drink lots of water! If you had a programable frequency generator you would program these frequency's. Alzheimers_1 (also see ALS sets) - 430, 620, 624, 840, 866, 5148, 2213, 19180.5, 742.4, 303, 23.2, 3773.3, 943.3, 471.66, 470.9, 941.8, 3767.3 Alzheimers_2 – 19180.5, 2213, 5148, 866, 840, 624, 620, 430 Alzheimers_TR – 430, 620, 624, 866, 5148, 2213, 1918, 742.4, 303 , 23.2, 2900, 864, 790, 690, 610, 470, 484, 986, 644, 254, 30, 33, 6 This detoxes the body, stimulates nerve cells, kills parasites. Ive cured from macular degeneration with whats called the VariZapper, frequency generator. you can program the above fz with a varigamma. colloidal gold, sold in most health food stores, rejuvenates detioration in the brain. surf the web, for varizapper/gamma, microcurrent and herbal cleanses. alzheimers can be cured!


 My mother's memory has been getting progressively worse over the past 3 years or so. She is now in the Alzheimer's wing at the care center though never diagnosed. I have just recently found out about how years of cholesterol-lowering medication can steal your memory, and I firmly believe this is what happened to her. You HAVE to have cholesterol for brain function, and dementia is becoming a well-known side effect of the medication. If she has been on that miserable stuff, check out spacedoc.com for a world of information. Since she's been off of it, we no longer have ""circular"" conversations over the same stuff every few minutes. Her memory is still full of holes, but she IS some better.


 Dementia is very common in the elderly. The odds of someone losing their memory as they age are great. For some, it's a fact of aging...unfortunately. I don't want to sound harsh, because believe me, I have been there with my grandmother. But your grandmother is 91...she is at the end stage of life. Is she in pain? Discomfort? If not, then it might be wise just to let it run it's course. The medication they take for dementia tend to have side effects and you have to ask yourself....do you want to have your grandmother go thru the side effects for a medicine that may or may not work? Please understand that I say this sincerely (since it's hard to understand the tone in a post). I know this is rough...especially if it's someone you truly care about . No one wants to see someone they love suffer in any way or form. But if she already has a caretaker and if that caretaker IS taking care of her than that is the important thing.


 Hi Jovigirl -- yes, this is very tough. My Mother has dementia, and she knows that her memory is failing. She doesn't remember anything, so we just say she lives in the moment. I'm glad that there is someone who is taking care of her and watching over her. I agree with Sherry that at this point, the doctors probably wouldn't be able to do anything except give her a med which would have side effects. The one good thing taking her to the doctor would be if she wasn't feeling good or was in pain -- which she might not even realize. My sister took my Mom in to have some skin cancer removed, and she didn't remember that it was done. She couldn't figure out why her arm hurt. She can still carry on a conversation but as you said, we go over the same thing again and again. It took the family a long time to accept that she lives in the moment, but now that we do; we just go with it. Take care, and what a wonderul granddaugther you are! Oh, one more thing -- is try and bring up memories from long ago, for some reason their long-term memory is better than short term.


 Very sad that many people have to finish life this way. I often wonder who has it worse the person with the illness or the ones who have to watch it happen.


 I worked in the Alzheimer's ward and Dementia ward in the Nursing Home I had employment at. In all honesty, it sounds like she has dementia, not Alzheimer's as she still recognizes you. From my experience, the patients with Alzheimer's were in their own world - didn't recognize us, didn't know their own name, didn't recognize family, and eventually they forgot how to even speak and feed themselves. We had to feed them when it was advanced, change them (as they also forgot how to use a restroom), dress them, do everything for them. In the experience with my working in the Dementia ward, as well as my maternal grandmother that I solely took care of, and now my paternal grandparents that I assist with daily living now has been more stable. I have seen the dementia people able to dress themselves, sometimes forget whom we are, remember us sometimes, get us confused, use the restroom, bathe, feed themselves, and of course all their confusement


 Im a granddaughter too, in a similar boat. It is pretty early on,but the meds have run their course and it is catch-up time. She was still living alone up until summer. She was diagnosed with lung ca. So someone is always there now. First for surgery, then because of chemo. She still sees herself as living on her own. So I have until January/February to figure out how to get family to recognize. It is frustrating, lonely. It has taken alot not to turn this into a big family drama. (I tend to speak my mind). The thought of that negativity being around my gma makes me keep my feelings to myself. I have had an aunt lead me to believe that she was staying her nite (first after 3 nites in her bed) w/ gma (Dr.s told us very specificly that she couldnt be left alone at all for the first week)---she dropped her off at her house after picking her up from hospital then she left her to go see her bf that she had been with the last 3 nites....really....She is now the one staying with gma and carrying her to her second chemo treatment and nursing her the next couple weeks. I am down with my chronic condition. I keep in touch reg. but I have given my aunt the opportunity to be there for her mother and to get a better understanding about her dementia(alz). Even family can be strange at times."
Need input from real live caregivers,"My grandmother passed away from Alzheimer's in the 1990s. Although I was not her direct caregiver, I saw how devastating the disease was from visiting her and the effects it had on other family members. I am now a writer researching Alzheimer's for a book project. I have hit the library, consulted the internet, talked with several doctors, and still cannot come up with a definitive answer so I am asking for your help. Here are my questions: 1. The opening of the book is a situation where the character is living alone and undiagnosed, and wanders away from home. Later chapters have this character, for a few hours or days at a time, functioning somewhat normally. Her speech is mostly coherent and she is capable of routine tasks under the care and supervision of others. Is this realistic, or based on the late-stage wandering, would she be less cognitively aware and suffering more physical symptoms? 2. The character lives rurally on her farm. In attempt to help her feel normal, her niece (the primary caregiver) will allow her to drive short distances on the farm under supervision. Is this realistic? It is my sincere hope that my book, although fiction, will draw attention to the plight of Alzheimer's patients and their loved ones. I appreciate any input you can share.","1. Yes a person with AD can still be a wanderer with occasional moments of lucidity. The extreme late stages of AD is where the person dies due to lack of proper nutritional care and/or lung aspiration because they forget to eat or swallow. Wandering is more or less considered to be in the end mild/ to late moderate stages. 2. No, this is not realistic because AD patients tend to forget what a key is and where to put it, let alone where the gas or brake pedal are. Early stages perhaps it would be realistic but it sounds like you are basing your character off someone who has moderate AD."
Husbands Dr says it's Dementia and not alzheimer's,"I just wanted to post an update on my father in law. So far things have changed but not for the best. My father in law is more confused than he used to be. The other day he went out to change the oil in his truck which he has been doing for 10 years. He got under his truck and had no idea where he was at, he commented how he was lost and didn't understand what was going on. My husband had to get under the truck and show him where the oil filter was located. The moodieness is still on going as well as basically doing nothing around the house. He used to help with the ice trays and little things like that and now that we help with it he doesn't do it at all. I have noticed he does this with other things as well. I am not sure if this is the dementia or just him feeling like since we are here we can do it. He still is capable of doing things for himself and little things around the house and I would like to see him continue but my husband enables him. I feel like I am constantly picking up after people and it's getting tireing. I just really need to know if his behavior of not doing things to help out is a normal part of this illness or something else. I am still trying to educate myself about dementia but still need all the advice I can get!","Thank you for your response. I can definately say he is not confused when it comes to not doing things to help out like he used to. That is one of the reasons I had wondered about him just decideing he didn't need to help. I believe he just doesn't want to do it anymore! Which I really don't apprichiate we do alot for him so that we can help him. I don't like being taken advantage of though and it really does feel like that. I am a compassionate person but I have my limits like everyone else


 My husband and I have tryed to talk to him about it, He just laughs so I just get more upset. My husband has been trying to call his attention to these things and it doesn't make a difference. I think maybe were going about it the wrong way


 I'm also thinking he's embarrassed as well because he may not remember how to do some of those simple tasks. This is how my Mom started out. She knew it had to be done...just couldn't remember the process and was embarrassed to ask. I second the post to stop doing the simple tasks and see if he can do them. It's hard to tell at this stage because they seem somewhat rational, so it's tough to figure out. My Mom used to laugh about her forgetfulness too and shrug it off; one time my Dad was in the hospital, I came over to visit and went to his room. He said my Mom had just left, so I went to find her, and she was sitting in the lobby. She had no idea where the car was. That was the huge red flag we all needed. I talked to my Dad and he admitted that she could no longer do the simple stuff. Even dinners were half done because she didn't turn the oven on, or forgot something to go with it...something totally off for a person who was always totally with it! Take care and hugs.


 To Traveler, I thank you for your advice. I try to do things like you and your husband do, like giving hints and things like that so that we don't end up doing it for him. I do agree that when their going through this that they need to have stimulation so that it helps to keep them active. It can be very difficult to know what is going on from day to day because he doesn't talk about it. We just try to do the best we can without making him angry lol!!!


 It's hard to tell what is what. He may not be doing things for himself because maybe he thinks why bother, someone else can do it or it can very well be part of his dementia. If he shows confusion over something, than its probably the dementia. Or if he throws things on the floor and doesn't bother to pick it up (when in that past he would), it might be the dementia as well. You guys know him better than us obviously, so it's hard to say because we don't witness it nor do we know his history.


 I totally understand! Have you talked to him about it?


 I know this sounds a little weird but....have you tried just NOT doing things for him? I don't mean the big or important things, but the filling of the ice trays. You mentioned your husband seems to be enabling him. If it really is laziness or a desire to have things done for him, the enabling definitely won't help. Eventually, he's going to get tired of hot drinks, and hopefully will take the hint and start filling the ice tray, that kind of thing. If it is the dementia though, and it ends up that trays are in the freezer but theres no water in them, or he leaves the water running, or things like that, then you'll know. It could be that he's embarrassed. If he's having trouble doing things (like the incident with the oil change), he might not want people to see how bad its getting. So he just allows people to do for him and hopes noone notices what's happening? My grandpa has horrible dementia now as a result of fluid build up in his brain. But before it got really bad, it used to be that he would purposefully avoid doing things he had trouble with, so that people *supposedly* wouldnt notice. Hs laughing off your concerns could be a part of that too.


 I'm new to all of this, but I've begun to notice that my FIL - who has moderate (??) dementia - too is frequently too embarrassed to ask for help with the simple things, but that it changes from day to day what he needs help with. Last night, he forgot the whole process of putting his dentures ""to bed"" (again), so hubby and I worked together to help him remember. This allowed him to do the task by himself, with as few hints and just telling him what to do as possible. We don't want to give his brain less stimulation, so we try to have him try to remember without allowing him to get too frustrated. When he gets too frustrated with the chore, he just decides it's not that important!


 I do understand, Lisa. It is a hard thing to know just how much they can comprehend at any given time. I've had a brain infection due to Lyme disease and have experienced a short lived bit of cognitive dysfunction, and I know that I dealt with a lot of frustration at not being able to express myself and not being able to make sense of the world around me any longer. It's quite scary actually. I too had a lot of anger at these circumstances, so hang in there!! All we can do is our best each day."
Support Through Intergenerations & Family,"My name is Sarah. I recently graduated from CSU Fullerton with my master's degree in gerontology. Through my studies I was very interested in dementia among older adults and how family members, including adolescent children, are affected by the disease. Alzheimer's disease can be very devestating, due to the various declines from stages. As a result from my project, I published a schoolage children's book through kindle called **********. The purpose of my story is to educate children on how they can notice certain behaviors of their loved ones in their own home and out in the community. With the help of parents and communication, children will be able to openly express their feelings and emotions. Children will also be aware of family support and connection they need, and ways to contibute as a family team. Creative thinking through young children enhances older adults to reminisce about past memories. Through intergenerational activities, older adults can better enhance their quality of life. Thank you for your time in reading my story to share and I would love to hear from you soon! When you get a chance I would love to share with you on the creation of my book and your feedback! Post Edited By Moderator (Red_34) : 2/20/2013 9:30:46 PM (GMT-7)","Thank you


 I wish you well on your book and its awesome that you are raising awareness for Alzheimer's but unfortunately I had to edit out the title of your book as this is not allowed on this forum. Best wishes"

confusion on waking up,"My 90 year old mom is in mid stages of AD very high functioning and able to look after herself. In appearance, energy she looks 60 ! When she gets up in the morning and after her afternoon nap, she is very confused as to where she is and cries bitterly that she"" doesn't want to live like this"". It last anywhere from 30-60 minutes. Any thoughts, shared experiences or suggestions? Thanks!","It's good that your mother is still so active. My mother wasn't active at all when I began to care for her. The first thing I did was start a walking program each morning before breakfast. In no time at all she was able to go faster than me, and she became animated, and much more healthy overall. She had memories resurface once in awhile. They were gone sometimes within minutes. Once I went into the bathroom to check on her, and she looked up at me and said, ""I'm going to go somewhere and kill myself."" She'd taken her depends off and thrown them in the bathtub. Thankfully, that short return to ""normal"" was over by the time she was out of the bathroom. I've always suffered from anxiety attacks, and the least twinge would cause me to become sure I was dying, and I'd have it checked out. Then one day I got a new kind of tea I hoped might help my overall anxiety. It was Tension Tamer Tea. I drink a cup a day, sometimes every other day, or when I feel anxiety creeping up on me, and find I'm so tranqul that even two conditions that I have, maybe even more of them, could prove fatal. Even knowing that doesn't really bother me. Maybe this tea would help your mom.


 Hi, there are days where your loved one actually recognizes something isn't right. My Gma when I cared for her, rest her soul, she would recognize something wasn't right and couldn't figure out why she couldn't remember things. My GMA would also say she doesn't want to live like this. I think perhaps it is a norm for dementia patients. As funny as this sounds, I would say to her ""Don't worry Grandma, Its just your forgetters working overtime. It happens to everyone, even me."" She would laugh a little then say ""Really?"" Then say ""I wonder why this happens"" and I would quickly quip how it happens just because of stress, or medications, or not being relaxed enough, not sleeping enough, I would think of any excuse to make her happy again. It worked too, I would have her happy again. It was always about the same time too. The best way to look at it I have found, is that they go back in time. The memory goes back to when they were a baby, and the body just stays in an adult body. If I were to stop imagine, what it would be like slowly losing my memory I would hate it too. So you just got to make the best of it. Come up with some stuff they would laugh at, like my forgetters working overtime. Perhaps you can try that."
Constant Diarhea,"Good Morning everyone! My FIL has been home with us the second time for a little over 6 weeks. And every other week he gets Diarhea...We can NOT seem to fight it. We give him immodium just as the doctor says...it goes away for a week than comes back with a vengence! There has been no medication changes. But the last doctors appt the doctor tells us to put some pounds on him but HOW if he poops it all out. He is to the point of having to Thicken his liquids, and soften his food but NOT too soft. He can actually eat a bologna sandwich if we sit with him. He cant use the bathroom any longer because he is now unable to walk. So he wears Briefs (depends) He has NOT gotten any bed sores thank goodness and his bum is clear. But the Diarhea is HORRIBLE and his stomach OMG its so loud almost like a train coming through. Has anyone had this issue with Alzeimers? I bleach down his bedding and bed after every bout of diarhea so he doesnt havent any nasty bacteria flying around HELP","Incontinence is normal for someone with AD, however persistent diarrhea is not. What medications is he on? Diarrhea can be from a wide array of things. Has he seen a gastroenterologist?


 I'm sorry that you all are having to go thru this but once again...what med(s) is he on at the present time and has he seen a gastroenterologist?


 I would suggest that you look into probiotics for him. Chances are with that kind of issue with diarrhea his good bacteria in his intestines is out of balance. Then get him in to see a GI doc that you know is good.


 Yes, your loved one must be seen by a GI. It can mean so much, a virus, intestine problems, side effect of medication, food intolerance, drink intolerance, celiac, chron's, ibs, so much


 The diarhea could be unrelated to his Alzheimer's; it could be ulcerative colitis or any other gastrointestinal or digestive disease. A decrease in digestive enzymes goes along with aging. Why don't you try looking in those directions. If your doctors don't want to address it, get a new digestive track doctor. Something is very wrong.


 Thank you everyone. It is so interesting. None of his meds have changed...And the docs just keep saying take immodium? The visiting nurse came today and said the same thing that his system must just be messed up? Are you kidding? this poor man has lost enough dignity by his son having to change him as it is but CONSTANT diarhea? The nurse told us today that if it was a stomach issue than it wouldnt be ON and OFF? His stools are already VERY loose as it is and he has lost a tremedous amount of weight. We do not know how much because he cant stand up to take his weight but its very noticable. We are filling him with Pedialite and Gatorade just as the doctor told us to do so he does not get dehydrated. I am so sad for him but I am also sad for my husband he sees no end to the mess. And believe me when a doctor speaks my husband takes it to heart so if the doctor were wrong my husband wouldnt know because he does exactly what they tell him to do. I am just at my wits end with the runaround from the nurses and doctors. Im sorry for the vent session but watching this amazing man dwindle away to nothing is so sad.


 He is on Exelon patch, Metformin, Glipizide, Depakote, Plavix, 250 mg aspirin No recent changes in Meds and no the doctor has NOT referred him to a GI doc


 It really is a sad situation, but he needs to be seen by a GI. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous for the elderly because they can dehydrate so fast. My Gma, who lived with me for 5 years had dementia, she was having D so I took her to my GI doc. Her d turned out be diverticulosis. The GI had us increase her fiber and put her on fiber supplements. She never really had much issue with it afterwards. Have you tried fiber supplements to help bulk up his stool yet?


 Yes, get him to a doctor asap. Emergency room perhaps? This might get him into the hospital where they can do some tests and figure out what the issue is. Also, my Mom was very low in weight (84 lbs.) and when she moved into memory care, they started giving her a product called Magic Cup. Very easy to swallow and it's full of nutrients. She nows weighs 105. She has a swallowing problem, so between the Magic Cup and Ensure she has gained the much needed pounds back. Take care, and hugs. I know this is tough for you and your husband -- vent away anytime. That's what we are here for! Carol"
HIV AIDS articles about gay men is absent from Healing Well,"Hi everyone, A new member of HW, and a 2 decade trained HIV Health Advocate - I hoped to share this website with newly diagnosed HIV+ clients, but I noticed NO articles in the list about the two largest groups of people with HIV in the US - Black Americans and Gay male Americans. HIV is caused by decisions in social settings - black and gay social settings mostly. why have I seen no discussion of the needs of leadership or in coverage of social issues related to Afro-American or gay-male-American issues? Hope to soon - this will make your website relevant to people with HIV. I see articles about Women and HIV. I see women and children with HIV - how about addressing the two most infected social groups. Thanks for addressing unintended racism and homophobia in your coverage!! Thanks!","Yes, wrong forum -- but I did check the AIDS forum and if you search around, you can find a page that has many link to articles relating to AIDS, and one in particular about being and gay and minority. I think HW tries to reach out to as many people they can. Remember that the threads you see are by actual people who have issues. Please check the AIDS forum out again -- and I hope that you find what you are looking for. And welcome!


 I think you made a mistake. This is the Alzheimer's Disease forum. Sherrine


 And since this is a peer-support site, our content is closely related to those who use the site. I think everyone would welcome posting of this sort on the HIV/AIDS forum, so if you have information or links to post that would be helpful to others and perhaps stimulate a new conversation."

"Please, advice needed.","Background concerning our mother: She is 80, was diagnosed in 2010 with alzheimers and, after a few changes, is currently on aricept 10mg daily. She is physically healthy except for severe osteoarthritis with both knees well past the need for replacement and rheumatoid arthritis. She has ALWAYS been an independent, head-strong, never wrong personalilty. She, long prior to mental changes, has never recognized the need for nor agreed to designating a POA or living will. To relinquish such control isn't our mother. She has also, throughout our lives, let us know that she WILL NEVER go to a nursing home; it is a fear for her. She loves her ""things"" and her home is very important to her. Although her short term memory is poor, she has lived at home alone and writes her checks and does quite well with her personal tasks. Two of us alternated giving her medications each day and preparing evening meals; although we (3 daughters) have been on pins and needles knowing that she was a high risk for falls and that it was just a matter of time before something would happen. A little over 3 weeks ago it happened, she fell suddenly in her home just a few steps behind me (I was carrying groceries in). Trip via ambulance to ER, total hip replacement the next day, stayed with her around the clock d/t confusion and aggressiveness (we expected), transferred to rehab hospital for about 2 weeks with little PT education retained d/t poor short term memory. She needs 24/7 observation primarily because she will do as she wants, let go of walker etc, in her mind she is fine and doesn't need help. Often forgetting when and what even happened. I brought mother home with me and hoped that she would eventually accept living in my home; again, she is very high risk for falling plus she is still healing and under hip precautions. However, she has been relentless in demanding ""I want to go home, I need to go home I have things to do, you can't stop me I'll show you, I don't need any help"" along with periods of crying, anger, letting go of walker etc. I feel like I'm keeping her prisoner in my home. Because of her short term memory, we put her off each day by telling her she will be seeing her physician ""tomorrow"" and that she has to have someone with her 24/7 for now and that she has been with me only a day. This doesn't stop her actions but, eventually, by end of evening she starts settling down some. What do we do. She is far from forgetting her home; and when she says she wants to go home she means her physical home not her childhood. There are only the 3 of us; one works nightshift and babysits grandchildren on off nights, other is on disability herself, and me. We don't want nursing home plus the way mother is they would be calling us all the time to stay with her for safety or would just medicate her to a zombie. Please, any advice is appreciated. I'm wearing out fast.","Thank you for the suggestion. No, we haven't because we didn't know; will call and check into tomorrow. Until the accident, mother had been able to continue life in her home. So very independent, she just can't accept that as she is getting older that she needs help and how big a safety risk she is. Today she had a near syncope episode with me walking behind her; if I hadn't been right there to hold here upright til DH could come and assist me in getting her onto bed, she would have hit the floor. As soon as she felt stronger her first words, as always, were ""I want to go home; take me home"". She didn't even realize what had happened or how dangerous it was for her. When we talked to her about it she still denied she needed the help. We girls just keep saying that we'll take one day at a time and we'll figure it out. We just want to keep her safe; but she's not going to be happy. Again, thanks for input. Guess it helps to just vent a little.


 HenryC, I have to agree with interstategar that your Mom should go into a nursing home. My Dad passed away 2 years ago from Alzheimer related medical problems ( he was 83 ) and we had no other choice but to put him into a nursing home the last year of his life. He ended up getting around the clock attention that he needed, and we could not provide for him at home. Just a word of advise, please pick a GOOD nursing home. Do you homework and check ( online ect ) to make sure the home does not have many complaints against it and check what complaints have been filed with the state, if any, against that home.... Good luck to you and your Mom!


 Henry C ............ Please don't think of what you may do or need to do for your Mother is in any way cruel. Finances may limit your choices, but let me tell you a brief story of my Mother - who was diagnosed with severe Dimentia nearly two years ago, and who did suffer with it (unknown to me) for many years prior to that: Her first 15-months, after the diagnosis by her Primary docter, was spent at home with a 24/7 caregiver thru an insured and bonded agency. The cost of that was approximately $5000. per month - and, of course, the cost of operating her home, food, clothing and her insurance costs added another $2500. per month onto that. Mom never did get used to her having to buy groceries for the live-in caregiver ... but, I think you can picture that! And yes, medicare offered no assistance! Nine months ago, after leaving the hospital again (from an episode at night at home) - the hospital staff Psychiatrist said she must be admitted into a facility that had registered nurses on staff - and she cannot go back home. The caregivers did not have the medeical expertise that she needed at this stage of her dimentia. I looked at 6-places from a modest-priced nursing home ($5000.+ per month in this area) to several nicer homes with a separate dementia wing ($6000. to $7500.+ per month). What I found, and where she went, was a small facility that specialized in Dimentia and diseases affecting the mind with a maximum capacity of 60+ patients between 4-buildings. The caregivers there have been very good, and the programs very well structured with lots of small games played that excercise the mind. Encouragement to participate (not my Mothers greatest attribute) is very strong - and a patient just sitting in their room for a length of time is really not allowed. Each of the 4-small buildings has 2-building pets - typically a dog and a cat or two dogs. And the caregivers often bring their own children to work with them ... all positives to an aging mind. And - all the residents/patients have entertainment come in about 6 times a month .... in other words, somethings to live for! This Dimentia Assisted Living home does cost about $6000. per month, and it is not available for Medicaid!!!!!!! Whereas, many of the nursing homes will have x-number of beds that are approved for Medicaid. So ....... that's where it comes down to finances. In my case, Moms money will be virtually gone in 6 to 8 more months - so her house just went on the market. When sold, it will allow her to stay another two years or so at this facility. Only then, will she go into a Medicaid facility! Other background: Mom said for years ""I will not go into a nursing home""! Grandma (her Mom) died in a nursing home 20+ years ago! Mom is 95 years old .... and was driving until 2-years ago! Yep .... my Mother is ""head-strong""! Aren't they all???


 Have you thought of calling DHS and asking for an elderly intake worker? They have many programs. The caregiver can get time off programs too, and the elderly can also do some programs... it depends on what is best. just talk to them :)


 She needs to go into a nursing home. The cost of private care 24/7 is ENORMOUS and isn't covered by medicare. My mother was 90 when she first started showing signs. At 92 she claimed she just needed help with housework and errands. You can't win keeping her at home. She will be difficult no matter where she lives. For your own health, contact a lawyer and start the process for guardianship, not Power of Attorney, which she can revoke. The lawyer will arrange for 2 doctors to claim her incompetant, and you can legally make the decision for her to go into a nursing home. You will handle all her finances and all her legal decisions. Trust me, the best thing for my mother is when I became her legal guardian. She's safer in a nursing home, and if she's still social can interact with other patients. She's not safe at home.


 hi Henry i was sorry to read about your mother there is no easy answer and certainly not a one fix all solution. I would suggest you get better knowledge about the disease and would recommend ""and still the music plays"" by Graham Stokes it consists of a number of short stories from Grahams experiences helping those living with dementia also John Ziesel ""Im still here"" From Amazon £20 total Understanding and finding ways to relieve your mothers agitation and fears will be challenging but beneficial to both you and your mother maybe i could lend you a few from my experiences Elderly people in general dont like being corrected by those younger than themselves, fact nothing to do with dementia. So say you are doing the washing up after lunch and you mother has forgot she has just had lunch say ""sorry mum forgot just let me finish the dishes and i'll sort it, much like the story about your mum seeing the doctor, she will accept it go with it and forget. no confrontation no agitation no correcting them. Don't underestimate your mum. I had an occasion when i was working in a care home over several days. The corridor was about 100 yards long with another 30 yards at each end. A large gentleman ""shuffled"" back and forward all day, never looked up never spoke just tried the fire doors at the end of each corridor. I saw him approaching and moved out of the way to let him pass he said quietly as he passed ""thank you"" Says it all to me. Try to think how you would feel if strangers came into your home started to make tea, started changing things dressing or undressing you. So each time a ""stranger"" to you mum comes in simple knocking of the door and introducing themselves can improve the situation. Think about it from the handicap your mum has and you will adjust you and those supporting you and your mum and things will improve. we once did a clock for a customer, her mother in law was a Welsh speaker, i offered to do the clock in Welsh subject to getting the translations from her mother(didn't want to get dialect wrong and cause more distress) months later i got email thanking for the clock but saying the mother in law who lived with the family had been a problem was now teaching the family Welsh and the atmosphere had totally changed. She now had a purpose and worth hope these help and offer you some hope kind regards John"
An email I got,"Just thought I'd share this, it fits right in here hope I gave you a chuckle No offense anyone A mature (over 60) lady gets pulled over for speeding... Older Woman: Is there a problem, Officer? Officer: Ma'am, you were speeding. Older Woman: Oh, I see. Officer: Can I see your license please? Older Woman: I'd give it to you but I don't have one. Officer: Don't have one? Older Woman: Lost it, 4 years ago for drunk driving. Officer: I see...Can I see your vehicle registration papers please... Older Woman: I can't do that. Officer: Why not? Older Woman: I stole this car. Officer: Stole it? Older Woman: Yes, and I killed and hacked up the owner. Officer: You what? Older Woman: His body parts are in plastic bags in the trunk if you want to see The Officer looks at the woman and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes 5 police cars circle the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun. Officer 2: Ma'am, could you step out of your vehicle please! The woman steps out of her vehicle. Older woman: Is there a problem sir? Officer 2: One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner. Older Woman: Murdered the owner?

 Hahah Lol Thanks for sharing UA


 Cute :)


 LOL!! What a way to get out of a speeding ticket!!!"
Lessons I learned dealing with In Home and Facility caregivers,"The cardinal rule in my view is take all your loved one's valuebles ie jewelery, collectables, cash, checkbooks, EVERYTHING and put them in another address where caregivers don't have ANY access. It doesn't matter how reputable the company is, that does background checks, people you know, that aren't immediate family members (unless they can't be trusted either.) There are people who do this type of work to steal from the helpless elderly. I was my mother's legal guardian, and she had cash and my deceased father's wedding band stolen from her home,and when she moved into a nursing home, had her wedding band stolen from her finger. At her home both private caregivers, and screened employees with no record stole from within her home. In the latter, they let someone in the house to steal for them. The police never caught them. She claimed that she left the door unlocked and didn't here anyone come in. The company I hired on their contract has a clause in there to keep valuables secure or remove them from the house. I overlooked the wedding band. The cash was stolen by private independent caregivers my mother hired herslef before I became legally responsible for her care. She was stubborn and wouldn't allow me to take control until it was too late. Trust no one when it comes to the above mentioned items no matter how nice they seem to your face. Most people are honest but the crooks act very normal, and friendly also. You cannot tell the difference. Trust me on this.","Please take the ""cardinal rule"" from above seriously. My Mother was diagnosed and declared with severe dimentia by her primary care doctor about 2 years ago. After leaving the hospital in early 2011, she returned home - but (by doctors requirement) only under the care of live-in caregivers thru an agency. That lasted 15-months until the last time she was admitted into the hospital after severe dreams and hysteria. Since last September, she has been in an Assisted Living Home specifically for Dimentia. After just over 24-months of care - either in her own home or in the Assisted Living for Dimentia patients - her finances are dwindling down big time!!! Several months ago, I closed her safe deposit box - and earlier this week her house went on the market after fairly minimal re-work. It is now, after going thru her house, that I find all of her gold bracelets that were photographed by her many years ago (from the safe deposit box) are simply GONE!!! In her last two declining years, she could have given some of them away (she was prone to buying love if you will), they could have been stolen by the caregivers - or (knowing her) she could have hidden them from the caregivers, and of course, she can't remember anything about that! It is sad ... but mostly because of an older virtually helpless person is at the mercy of, at times, so many greedy people. Example - I did later find out, a year ago, two of my cousins from out-of-town were each written $500. checks by my Mother as a gift. One of the cousins had a small diamond necklace that was supposed to be given to her (after my Mother died). Magically, that necklace along with the gold bracelets are all gone. In fact, I found her jewelry box last week buried in a drawer - and it was completely emptied................... so sad!


 To Bella33 ....... Our family size is small unfortunately. My step-father passed away 18-years ago, and my Mothers only brother (and his wife) passed away over 15-years ago. There are no other living aunts or uncles, and I have been living (and was working) out of a home over 20-miles away from Mom's house - still do live there. I do have one daughter, that very unfortunately, my Mother drove out of her house at dinner 21-years ago - and then got into my daughters business with her mother-in-law about 15-years ago right after the baptism of my oldest grandaughter. I'll simply leave it that my Mother had a substantial drinking problem for decades!!!!!!!! My youngest daughter had been away in college for most of that timeframe getting a B.A. and an M.A. And, as for me, I did actually call my Mother every day around 5pm from the time that my step-father passed away until last Summer ... yep - every day!!! I am battling a couple of major problems - COPD for the past 5-years, Prostate cancer first diagnosed in 2003, treated - and then it came back and spread two+ years ago - and it created a problem in both of my kidneys - so I have been in the hospital 3-times with kidney failure in the past 18-months. But ... I have been paying all of her bills the past three years - and have been over to her house at least weekly for three years - so the family has been very much just ME! The ""buying the love"" thing has been there as long as I can remember. A psychologist that I went to for months after Mom threw my daughter out of her life, said my Mother has a very low sense of self-esteem ... and that started before my existence!!! You don't know how often I wished I had a brother and/or a sister!!!


 To Bella33 ..... Thanks ................. I have tried! You just proved, with what you said ... something I keep telling my Mother who always wishes she had a big family - ""big families don't always work""! I'm sorry it's not working well for you. Some things have been tough with her - but she is still my Mom! Keep on keeping the faith!


 That is just so wrong. Yes unfortunately no one can be trusted. These crooks will get bad karma.


 May I ask a valid question? Where were you and other family members during this time of need? I'm not surprised people steal from their employees who are feeble minded. They figure if the family isn't there to watch them then too bad for him or her. The way you said sounds like your poor mom was often trying to buy people's love. Why is that do you know? My mom also hid her jewelry during her paranoid state. To this date I still can't find a couple of pieces of expensive items and I had a catalog of her stuff. What are you going to right? The only way to prevent is not to watch out because you just don't know. The only way to prevent is to do it yourself and if it's not possible then well....


 Guess what? I have an older sister and 2 older brothers. I'm the youngest and I'm still the only caregiver to my mom. You know how it goes. If you know someone is taking care of things then you leave well enough alone and go on with your life with blinders on. That's my siblings. I confronted my sister about this years ago and her solution was to send our mom to a home so we can all be free. I said hell no because I could never live with myself knowing this would be done out of convenience for us all. My mom was a saint and always put her needs last. As a matter of fact we were always joined at the hip so her needs came last and so did mine. My sister has been married for 30 years and is pretty well off and does not need to work and her kids are out of school and in the work force. You'd think she would help me more but no. She belongs to the church and do more for them then I care to elaborate. My brothers are totally out of the picture. Out of sight and out of mind. Growing up no one told me how my life would end up like this. My youth is gone, my propects are gone. I just take it one day at a time and ***** about every little thing I have to do extra. haha To tell you the truth I wouldn't know how else to live my life since I've been doing it for so long. I love my mom and til death do us part. You've had quit a long suffering life like me. I can totally relate to you and your misery. Your health is your biggest asset so hang in there and know you did everything humanly possible for your mom if not more. I applaud you!


 I am a big believer of Karma. However I have yet to win the lottery and my sister still lives the good life so hmmm..... I wish you a healthy recovery and good things will come your way."
"MIL has dementia, family fighting","My mother in law has dementia. 3 years ago I told my husband something was wrong. He spoke with his sister (the favorite child) and nothing was done. This happened over and over for about 6 mths. I finally corned my sister in law and told her there was a problem and gave her some advice in what to do. For the 13 yrs I've been with my husband his family has treated me like a cute dumb girl (I'm 10 yrs younger than my husband). My MIL especially would make rude comments about me in front of everyone then say it was a joke. Since she had gotten sick I got in a bad accident (hit by an 18 wheeler). My first day off work I took her an appointment. Ever since I have listened to the family (my hubby, the daughter, who is also married and the husband, moms husband but not dad) fight. They fight over everything. My husband tries to play peacemaker, my brother in law ignores or only supports his wife . My sister in law and father in law explode on each other. I watched this for months and saw my MIL just get worse, so I just started handling it. Now almost 2.5 yrs later I'm the prime caregiver, in pain management and my father in law had a heart attack. The fighting has not stopped, in fact its worse. My sister in law shows up once every 4-6 weeks, ignores anything I've set up (elder care that comes in, food prep, doctor appointments, clothing, hygiene care) and does what ever she wants. For the day or 2 she is present (she lives in area, but still only comes by once a month or so) I've spoken to my husband. Begged him to talk to her, His mother gets worse after this craziness, her husband gets mad and I've got even more on my plate calming everyone down. Instead my husband comes back saying he's stuck in the middle between his wife, his sister and his mom's husband. Since my mother in laws husband had the heart attack this have gotten worse but I've managed both the heart attack situation and her dementia. All doctors have told me to continue on as is, they are doing good. Now I'm hearing constant phone calls from outside friends and family giving my husband ""poor babies"" and your doing a great job, keep it up. No body in this situation is doing anything but me! When they do try to help they ignore everything set up and I spend more time away from my family and my medical situation having to fix it. I want to grab my kids and leave. Leave this whole family to deal with it themselves! But I know doing that will hurt the people who need it the most my mom in law and father in law. What do I do!?","I'm so sorry you are feeling so overwhelmed and ready to leave! I second smurfyshadow - please consider talking to your husband about everything that you shared here and how you feel. Praying for you!!


 Welcome to Healing Well! Have you talked to your hubby on how you really feel about how you are ready to leave with the kids? It sounds like a good sit down talk is in order. Where is your mother in law staying? With you? If so, you can by all means not allow your sister in law in the house and say she isn't welcome. Your husband certainly needs to know how you feel, all of it hon. Talk to him.


 To jad18 ....... So sorry to hear you're in the middle of this. Your husband is too, but it sounds like in a much different way. I would wonder if you and your husband would gain benefit from seeing a couples counselor. Not for the typical reasons ... but it does sound like your husband, at least, is not recognizing what you're doing, and that it's mostly for the benefit of his own mother. He does need to take a stand with his own family ... and probably should be the one to make peace with and/or to tell his own sister to butt out - since she chose not to be one of those to take care of her own mother. I think it would be very beneficial, if when meeting with a couples counseler, that you should make your own statements - about your own feelings regarding the care of your MIL. It should make you feel better, and it might even make your husband realize sone things he has been taking for granted. I am an only child, and hardly a child .... but a divorced Dad of two daughters with some serious health issues of my own. I have dreamed of having a brother or a sister - or both - to for one, help me with all of the things you've been doing. Now you make me wonder! But anyway, in looking ahead ... many difficult decisions will have to be made for a least one if not two seniors in the future. My Mother, three years ago after a fall that hospitalized her, was told she could not go home unless she had 24/7 care ... which is what I did. It worked well for 15-months, even though a couple of evening episodes happened that were scary. She was then hospitalized after one of those episodes. And after several weeks of psychiatric observation in the hospital, she was allowed to leave - but only if going to a facility with a full-time nurse on staff. So for almost a year now, she has been in a well-run facility fairly close-by that specializes in dementia and parkinsons patients. It has taken her a long time to accept not having her own home - and most importantly - calling her own shots! But she has. She looks forward to many of the games they play there, and getting her hair done twice a month, and her nails done twice a week, and the entertainment that comes in 5 or 6 times a month. And everything is clean and well-managed - but costly! Last month, her homehad to be sold. It was vacant for the past eleven months - and frankly her savings were getting low. Please keep in mind, you don't want the whole family arguing about any of the things in the above three paragraphs - when they come. And they will come. And you do want the full support of your husband before those times come. He needs to bear some of the pain - and work. Best of luck to you ..... think about that couples counselor. Rob"
Retirement home with assisted living.,"This is sort of extension of my post ""My Mom hates the nursing home"". For all that replied there, Thanks so much for your advice/recommendations. I thought I would start a new one, as it was getting long and winding. To recap, I'm very unsatisfied with the nursing home my Mom is currently in. I think that she would benefit from a more social environment, so I've made appointments at two local retirement living homes. The first one was extremely impressive. Top notch 5 star everything. Unfortunately, in the end, it was just too independant for my Mom, who's dimentia is too advanced. It bothered me that they didn't seem to care whether she was a good fit or not, they just wanted her in there, and have called me about a half dozen times. Enter the second home. Not as fancy and new, but I was very impressed with what I saw. The assisted living package is an additonal $500 a month, but it will give her all the assistance with personal care, and getting around that she'll need. There's a big emphasis on activity there. I will need to get my two brothers on board with exploring this option further. I certainly hope it's a good fit for her. It's hard for me to make a quick decision, as I'm not exactly impartial, and I do find myself thinking with my heart at times. We'll see what happens.","Hello 73monte: It sounds like you've pretty much made the decision - and are waiting for the input from your brothers. This is so hard ... hope all three of you come to the same conclusion so there are no doubts later. Best wishes to you.


 To 73monte: The last thing I would want to do is to add confusion to your decision. But, my Mom is in a Home for Assisted Living for Dementia and Parkinsons patients. It is a very specific need home - and not a nursing home. The care-givers are trained for those two diseases. They know what they're doing ... and they have an RN on staff at all times. It's not just a place for activities. The patients are strongly encouraged not to stay or hibernate in their room for a reason ... cause dementia gets worse that way!!! I have no siblings, so my decision didn't need to either be popular or money motivated. I love my Mother and want what's best for her. And as far as I'm concerned, I'de rather see her lifetime savings make her as comfortable as possible with the proper care as long as it can - than think about how much is left for an inheritance! After all, it was her money. It is a very difficult decision ... weigh all things in your own best judgement ... and never feel any guilt about your decison. Follow your heart ..........


 I agree with SO much of what Franklen wrote. My mom has Alzheimer's, diagnosed 10 years' ago. Lived with me for one year and it nearly destroyed my marriage and my physical and mental health. And, I had a caregiver here because I worked full time, but my office was in the home and my mother refused any help from the caregiver and insisted I take care of her, which I wasn't able to do during working hours. It was constant stress, CONSTANTLY. When the caregiver left, I cared for mom, from about 4pm until she went to bed at 9PM. Then my husband would come home and he would want time with me, but wasn't able to because I was tending to mom. As I said, it nearly killed me. Mom went on to live with my sister, then into assisted living and now in skilled nursing, awaiting public aid. She is completely out of funds. Fortunately, I have her in a facility that is 5 star, highest rating in this area, all private rooms and they accept that she is public aid pending and they are only taking her social security check for now. Franklen perfectly described what the Alzheimer's/dementia floor is like. Yes, the staff is specially trained to work with AD/dementia patients, but patients have rights. So if someone refuses to shower, they do not push it. My mother went SIX weeks without a shower. Believe me, I was there, I visit her often, I was going every week day, but now have cut down to two days a week and my sisters go on the weekends. I tried everything to get her to shower. Thankfully, they are able to get her to wash up at the sink in the morning. She goes through periods of refusing to eat, and then refusing to take meds. I believe she does this because she doesn't want to lose control, that is the only thing she has control over, if she showers, or eats or takes medications. I know, for her own well being and safety, she cannot be in our homes. She falls constantly because she refuses to use a walker in her room. Her bed now has an alarm, so staff knows when she gets up to use the bathroom so they run there and walk her to the toilet. Thankfully she has not broken anything. I feel as if she is going through hell and she is taking me with. I am NOT blaming her. It's just so difficult to watch her on this journey. I see a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist for depression and anxiety and take medications. I find myself looking at her and thinking how sad this is, what she has become. She is so insecure, she does not leave her room except to go eat. There are many activities, none of which she will go to. She stays in her room, all day long. I beg her to let me take her outside to a beautiful courtyard, take her by wheelchair...no. Take her out for coffee, for lunch, for dinner, buy her something...no. All she wants to do is stay in her room and yet she calls me at least four times a day to tell me how lonely she is and asks ""when are you coming?"" when I was just there an hour before. Believe me, I know it is the disease, but it is still so hard to deal with, to wrap your head around it all. Well, I really went off on a vent here.... Miriam


 To 73monte ..... I hope your Mom is feeling a little more comfortable now in her surroundings. It does take some time. The last time I saw mine, two days ago, she was in and out of napping. She was sitting in the great room along with 10 or 12 others ... the TV was on a music of the 50's channel for the first hour and not many people were paying attnetion to it ... a lot of napping going on at 1pm to 2pm. Then one of the caregivers changed the channel to Lifetime for the next hour ... but there was little change in how interested everyone was. I think ....... the residents had gotten so used to the level of activities that normally are being done daily, the lack of activities was putting everyone to sleep. My only point is ... we humans can get used to nearly anything - even if it's very difficult in the beginning. I do believe that activity of some sort is invaluable to someone suffering from dementia. Prior to that, the last two times I was over, the weather was really nice, so Mom and I spent our time together outside. And funny enough, her stories were all about ficticious things that were happening to where she thought she used to live. In reality, I realized she was talking about the place she is in - and has been in for over 11-months now. It is sad that her memories of her own home are gone ... but that's the disease of dementia. What has replaced those memories are things that she thinks happened where she now lives. She thinks they were years ago, but ... if they ever happened, it was months ago. Please try not to feel any guilt for trying to do the very best for your Mom that you can do. Peace and hapiness


 Praying for the right doors to open for your mom and that she will be well taken care of!!!


 I don't recall how old your mother is. In Canada I don't know what portion, if any, that the government will pay for her care. I do remember mention of the fact that your two brothers are not much help. Say the fee is $5,000 or more each month. If she is advanced in age and doesn't want to be in a institution, why not keep her either in her home with you and others taking turns, or one person full time, or taking her into your home. In return, the full $5,000 or more goes to the person or persons who take on that duty. In most cases that frees up about $4,000 of that $5,000 that would be spent and that $4,000 is or can be tax free. Equal to perhaps $6,000 taxable earned income. More than most people make on their job. The costs are seldom more than that found in a institution and the patient/parent is usually happier. Either in their own home or that of a family member. Lots of seniors don't like ""activities"" and all that socializing. With dementia and Alzheimers it can often add to the confusion and anxiety. They also like to add a little something when the patients don't fit in. Sedatives and things to calm agitation. More when needed. Care, even in the best places is sketchy. There are only so many attendants per person and those with the most trouble get most of the attention. They all sound good before entering. They all have smooth sales presentations that make it out to sound much better than staying at home. Yet it seldom is. One needs to make unannounced visits, just walking in, to day rooms and the dinning facilities. Long ago I would go into dozens of these places in the course of supplying cleaning chemicals and detergents. about 40 years ago. The activities are as much for the families to see as for the patients to actually enjoy. Look at those patients who are not in the activities. That would be most patients. Either in their room or in the halls, alone. Each place is different, but we often focus on those few who both enjoy and join into the ""activities"". Personally I wouldn't want to have anything to do with the activities. I knew my father wouldn't join in, no matter how well they were done. Unless a parent is someone who enjoyed such activities throughout their life, then it is highly unlikely they are going to start enjoying such when they have dementia or Alzheimers. Sorry if I'm not so upbeat or looking on the bright side, but having seen and visited these places I don't see much happiness. More like holding cells that are made ""safe"" from falls. Everyone should ask themselves if they'd like to stay there and join in with these activities. Eat in these dining rooms. Stay 20 hours a day in their room. Now, there is a big difference for those who actively seek out such living in assisted living where most of the people are still sharp. Whose main limitations are physical. But in those where mental decline is the chief cause, I wouldn't want to end up there. Just because people can't think well, doesn't mean they don't know things are wrong and unpleasant. If there is money for a $5,000 a month facility and there is also money in perhaps a house, then there are assets to keep a person out of a facility, but all family members have to agree to free up the assets. Perhaps even more than the $5,000 if the extra thousand or so creates a substantially better quality of life and comports with the desires of the patient. Lots of families don't have resources, but they often have human resources. Even less desirable physical surroundings can be superior to institutions when the people doing the care are caring and can help I a personal way. People who know the person and their past. Who can relate to the small amounts of memory that remain. I realize every situation is different and everyone's financial ability is not unlimited. But human help is more important than fancy buildings and such. Seniors like to stay at home, or at least around people they know. That is the way it has been for thousands of years.


 I realize I was presenting the other side of the picture without trying to make the decision easier. Each case is different. Each dementia or Alzheimers individual is ...well, a individual. Each family's financial situation is different. Often times the burden is not shared between all the siblings, especially when there is only one daughter. Clearly we'd all wish all our parents would age well and then die peacefully in their sleep without ever having a difficult period. I guess I'm just inclined to make the case for families doing more, even when it causes disruptions and hardship. I did it for several years, almost 7. I'm not sure I'd do it again but at the time, there was no particular point I could stop and put my father where I knew he would be in such mental turmoil. I got the house for my deeds but the process fell right in the middle of my working life and when you add it all up it was no gift. We would have easily have spent the value of the house for care, and the individual wouldn't have been nearly as comfortable or as well attended to. Still, it was total disruption of one's life. Everything else is neglected. Especially ones social life. I have still not recovered from that. Ideally there are other siblings who give some respite. I got about 3 hours a week, which only allowed one to rush about buying all the items needed to make it through the following week. Hardly a break. So I don't want to make it out to be a picnic. Its a chunk out of one's life. Too bad we don't live in villages any more. Where families are all around us, sharing the common duties. All I would say is that if one can do it and decides to do it, that the other siblings should expect there to be a fair trade off in value of services rendered as well as understanding the added value of the quality of life that the parent gets. Some times they feel that someone helping at home shouldn't cost them as much as a institution would cost. In fact the care at home is worth even more if it gives the parent a superior level of care. Don't want to overly focus on the monetary matters but too often the sibling who does the care is expected to be some kind of martyr, where as others are quite willing to pay a institution whatever they ask. I would add, that I wasn't married. That situation can completely alter the decision for many as their spouse has to be considered in the decision. Not a easy choice. That is for sure and it depends on so many things such the age of the parent. Life expectancy. The path at the end is predictable in Alzheimers. I would add one final thing. If the patient is heading further into Alzheimers do only the minimum in medical care, aside from comfort, and make sure you have medical care power of attorney for those decisions. A close friend of mine who had placed his father in a institution was so angry when his doctor gave him a pacemaker. At the time his father was already well into Alzheimers, but my friend hadn't gotten medical power of attorney. He ended up comatose and in a completely rigid state for his last year or so. But his heart kept beating like clockwork as the nursing home kept getting $5000 or $6000 a month (back then). Do the best you can for both you and your mother under your own very particular circumstances.


 Miriam, You're making feel guilty for even posting here. What I've complained about going through with my Mom is nothing compared to what you've done. You're a saint for taking your Mom in for a year and sacrificing your whole life in the process. It sounds like you've done everything humanly possible to give your Mom the best quality of life considering the disease she has. I hope in time that your Mom will mellow, and become more receptive to her surroundings. My Mom was extremely unco-operative, crying, wanting me to get her out of the nursing home for the first 2 months that she was there. She doesn't love there now by any means, but she has adapted somewhat. I hope things improve for you as well."
moving Mom between siblings,"I have been fortunate to have a sister willing to step up and take care of my mom 24/7. Challenge comes from another sibling who believes a better path is for each sibling to take a turn caring for her. So a week here and a week there between 3 siblings. The only place she WANTS to be is in her own home but due to her dementia that is no longer possible. She could hurt herself and we all agree on that. So we are trying to determine the better path...move her from one sibling's home to another every week or so. My gut tells me familiarity is better...meaning no excessive hopping between homes. This doesn't exclude an occasional visits. Just calling one place ""home"" versus calling three places home. Thoughts?","Hello ...... I would think your Mothers greatest desire would be to stay in her own home. I have personally watched my Mother go thru several stages of dementia over the past couple of years. And while I don't have any siblings, and my house has all of the bedrooms on the second floor - I also have several severe health conditions myself including cancer coming back three years ago. Initially ..... I think your Mother being in one place only would be a close second to being in her own home - especially if it's with a loved one. With the deterioration of the mind with dementia, her new home with a loved one will soon become her new and comfortable home - I believe! Now ... does your sister have any kind of training ... and is she very patient ... and does she get her feelings hurt easily! These are all important factors, and there are short evening courses (often free) for caregivers that could help her anticipate what to expect. I did, until they stopped the program, go to a community weeky forum for caregivers. It was moderated by a young trained lady (probably in sociology) and the sole purpose was to provide an escape for each of the caregivers for 90-minutes a week. We heard stories of others. We were able to get suggestions and given direction by the moderator. I would highly suggest that for someone considering being a full-time caregiver. If .... there is a marriage or children living at home .... being a full-time caregiver could very easily destroy a family. So ... perhaps that's where the other sisters can come in .. for relief .. to give the caregiver a break - and family too if there is one. Consider also, that dementia is usually a disease that gets worse. I've seen that in my Mother over the past two years or more. Not just incontinence which is pretty typical - but at some point, just moving around from one space to another. Two years ago, my Mother needed a cane to walk - and was just beginning to use a walker. In the past 4-months, she rarely uses the walker anymore - she's moves by wheelchair now. And that requires wider doorways and no steps .... etc. etc! In my Mothers case, the doctor told her in April/May of 2011 that in order for her to be released from the hospital togo home - she must have 24/7 care. So she had an in-home caregiver for 15-months. It's expensive. Then, as the dementia got worse and her nightmares became a little visious, she went into the hospital for observation and medication prescript ions. Her doctor then said he would not release her to go home - even with 24/7 care. She needed to be in a facility with a full-time nurse. She has been now for a little over a year. One other thing, that in time, she may fall often. My Mom is starting to fall out of bed very often - and it's in the middle of the night. When she falls, it takes a very well trained person to lift the dead weight up without hurting her. It could take two people. You have a good start, some good thoughts and planning - but consider ... your Mothers condition will get worse. And nearly no one person can handle the responsibility of taking care of someone 24/7. Please consider one more thing, many dementia patients can get ornery ... or even nasty sometimes. And believe me ....... it is much easier for them to scream at a loved one than to a nurse or non-related caregiver. It's not fair ..... but it does happen. I've heard it myself way too many times from my Mother. It is very hurtful - something to give consideration. Well, your family has much ahead ... but if done as a family, I think it can be a manageable duty. Good luck to you and yours. Rob


 I think jumping to 3 different locations would highly disorientate your mother. People with dementia do better in a structured and stable environment. So personally, I feel that you all should have mom stay at one household but encourage the other siblings to take her on outings or to dinner at each others houses on occasion.


 Thank you Rob and Red 34. All helpful info."
Mother and tv,Hi I have a question and has anyone come across this I play my mum lots of DVDs musicals and comedy movies when watching them she assumes the people are real and they are talking to her like if I make her a cup of tea she asks me to ask the people on the tv I amuse her by asking them she can not watch the news or any one getting hurt as she gets upset ifs this apart of dementia another question it is hard to have a conversation with mum as she talks about things that do not relate to the conversation and when I take her out she thinks sometimes people are calling for her yes she does wear hearing aids I have had them checked and her hearing and there is no problem as well she sees people or things that are not there mum wears glasses and told she has macular degeneration iam getting this re-assessed in 2weeks Thank you,"Her Optomerist yes we have seen a dr that has diagnosed mum with dementia thank you rob


 Well, you are doing the right thing by going along. I help out my paternal gma with gpa who has dementia. He is a military vet, and he is worse than ever with the ""spotless"" house. Gma tried to clean the top of the stove, and argued there was nothing there. I happened to come to visit and she told me what was going on, and I went up to where he was scrubbing the stove and said ""papa, can I help you?"" and made it sound like I really wanted to, he accepted my offer, and said I would have to use elbowgrease, and watched me. By not argueing, and humouring, I avoided the behavior he gets cuz of the dementia.


 This is little confusing. Who said she has macular degeneration? My Mother did have it ... and she does have dementia at a fairly developed stage. There can be many things imagined by someone with dementia, but have you seen a doctor for diagnosis of that? I've watched people with serious dementia (where my Mother is at) and their reactions can vary tremendously. Some I've seen seem to be happy all of the time. Others are very distant. And yet some others are very crabby most of the time. I doctor is the best place to start. Don't let the word Psychiatrist scare you. That might be the best place after you see your primary doctor. You do need a professional trained opinion ... and maybe some tests. As long as there's no violence by your mum ..... everything should be very workable with a solution. Best wishes ............................................ Rob


 Hello ...... Have you considered having the macular degeration treated? My mother went to three of the treatment (maybe 5-years ago). She was a little stubborn, didn't like wearing the sunglasses and head coverings, or having to have someone drive her there. So, she told me she's not going anymore. It's not helping her vision. I told her it's to prevent further damage - not to improve vision. She said ..... she's stopping ... and she did. Good luck on the re-assessment. I hope the dementia she has is not too stressing on you or your family. It can be ... but it depends so much on the dementia individual. Wishing you the best. Rob


 Hi, it's a common symptom of dementia, thinking that people on TV are real, and imagining things. But if it is new, it's as well to get your Mum checked out by the doctor as it can be a sign of fever or infection. Another thing which is typical is thinking they have been somewhere they have seen on TV. We had a friend who was telling everyone they had been to the Olympics because she'd seen it on TV. You are right playing along with her, as if you try to argue you'll only make things worse. There is a new book out for caregivers which explains all the things which can happen and what to do about them: it's called ""A Healing Hug for Alzheimer's"". You might find it helpful."
Agitation caused by family-what to do?,"Hello! I'll try to keep this concise.. I have been working as a live-in caregiver for an 88 year old woman with stage 2 alzheimer's for about a year now. For the most part, things have been going really well. The majority of the time she sleeps through the night, hallucinations have been mild and there has been zero aggression. I am with her almost all of the time (I'm only able to do this because I work with my partner who takes care of the house!). I took a week off for christmas this year, and during the time her daughters covered nights for me. One of her daughters is very kind and understanding of her mother's condition. She doesn't ask her to ""remember"" things and is very mellow. Another daughter, whom I'll call Becky, is diagnosed schizophrenic and is often quite unsettling to her mother. She frequently brings up past events trying to get her to remember, and talks constantly at her, not with her. Becky has a boyfriend whom her mother has had major issues with in the past (during her earlier stages of alzheimers and before she had the disease). While I was gone over christmas, Becky had her boyfriend over for dinner and they stayed up quite late (the woman I care for usually goes to bed around 8:30, and Becky had her up with her boyfriend until around 11). Well, that night the woman I care for did not sleep and became extremely agitated with her daughter, paranoid that she had ""someone"" in bed with her (her boyfriend had left for the night). Well, ever since I got back from that trip the woman I care for had been having night time hallucinations surrounding children and babies quite frequently (3-4 times a week, when she would maybe wake up once a week to go to the bathroom before this incident). In the hallucinations, she is concerned she needs to help the child or put it to bed etc. showing that she is concerned for her children. These would intensify any time Becky would come for a day visit. Things progressed in this manner for about a month and a half. Then, one night she had a fall in the middle of the night because she thought she heard a baby crying in the other room (I have a motion detector to let me know when she sits up in bed, but she was already out of bed by the time I got down the hall!). She had a pelvic fracture from this incident. She has been recovering well, and the hallucinations entirely stopped! Becky has been around much less because of work, also. Becky came back for a visit a couple days ago, and this morning when I came in to check on the woman I care for she was hallucinating about children again. I am very very worried that this pattern will start again. But what can I do? Becky is a very unstable person in general and she deserves to be able to visit, but I think the way she interacts causes more harm than good. I feel that the woman I care for's hallucinations/agitation stems from unresolved family issues (her being upset with Becky's boyfriend). There's no way to resolve this, and I'm not sure how to responde when she hallucinates. I tell her the children are alright, but she is pretty obsessed at the worst moments and can't be distracted (her short term memory is pretty much gone). Any suggestions would be much appreciated! Sorry this was so long! Thank You!","Thank you, Red! That is a good idea. She may be able to help. Currently, the problem is that of the four children, Becky is around the most (but she definitely visits so that she feels better, not really for her mom). It seems like the other kids have a better understanding of the situation. They do visit, but at this point they see that a quick visit is probably better than a long one, and the frequency doesn't matter so much. But, this also means they're out of town more. Well, she slept pretty well last night so hopefully this will pass without incident. I administer her medication currently, and I have made the more responsible daughter aware of the issues with hallucinations that come up. She currently takes an all natural sleep aid. I have heard there are some drugs used to treat hallucinations in alzheimer's patients, but it seems like they have a lot of side effects. Thanks again!


 Is it possible the other three children could sit down with Becky and explain to her that her visits should be shorter for the mothers benefit. The mother does need her rest. And if the request comes from family - and not you, I would think it might be more seriously considered by Becky. And then there are no fingers being pointed at you by Becky. Rob and Gizzy


 This Becky may not know what she is doing. And pointing out this to her may not be the best either especially if she is Schizophrenic. What if you were to talk to the other sister about Becky? See if she might be able to help? Is your charge under medication at this present time?


 Hi I and my 2 older sisters take care of my mother who has dementia 81yrs old iam having the same problem when my older sister stays with my mum she gets into these angry and quite moods and sometimes aggressive and talking about babies and children and wakes up at night and stays up .and will not take her meds (not for dementia)my older sister is constant worrier and has anxiety but when I or my other sister stays we do not have this she is happy sleeps well only to go to the toilet yes she does sometime talk about the children and baby's I do not know if this is true someone told me to get her a baby doll do think this might help I think I might my sister to come and visit but not to stay


 My FIL had hallucinations that would really disturb him as well. I got the idea to try to convince him that either I or my husband had ""taken care of it"" and sometimes had to explain how, but it worked because he had trust in us. One time he just knew that there was a wall of water on the other side of the closet that was going to come crashing down on him in the middle of the night. There is no water or even pipes near that room or the adjoining room. I finally convinced him that my husband (his son) had been working in there all day long and had finally not only drained all that water out but had everything fixed so that it wouldn't happen again. These are not hallucinations to them, they are real (as you know) so if we treat them as real, sometimes it can help. It would be worth a try anyway. We also had issues similar to what you have experienced, and had to ask that person (his other DIL) to never bring up the subject again. It didn't fix the issue (he continued to have issues with this person), but it did keep my FIL from having more hallucinations because of a visit."
Hyperactivity with Alzeimer's ?,"Hi everyone My grandma is 90 and she has been diagnozed with Alzehiemers in 2002. Throughout the yrs the progress of the disease has been slowed by medication. 3 mths ago she broke her leg, eversince she has been forced to stay in bed ( she was on a wheel chair before) and has experiencing ups and downs. As expected with the disease she has good and bad spells. She is staying with my mom who is her main caregiver and both my aunt and uncle share the job with her whenever possible. Problem now is she sometimes gets into a hyper alert phase where she can stay for 48 hrs without sleep at the end of which she starts severe hallucinations and slurred speech. She has to be given a sedative to be able to sleep, this happens about every week. Any suggestions as for the reasons and what can be done","We tried diff sedatives as per doctors advice, however these seem to work for only about 2 or 3 days and then the cycle would start all over agian? Any medications that has worked with ur gma?


 My gma was the same way at the end. She fell and broke her arm and it seemed that she became worse after that. I was getting exhausted trying to keep up with her because she would be up and down all night. Even sedatives didn't work on her. Has your mother talked to the dr about this? Perhaps the doc can give her something to her to help calm her down.


 I suppose if she was very active before, being stuck in bed is not helping. It is one of the things which make it almost impossible to care for a person at home. I hope that you find a solution."
Dr. recommendation for memory loss in Los Angeles area???,"Can anyone recommend a doctor in the Los Angeles area for memory loss? I'm only 39 and have trouble remembering things like general details of a movie or TV show I had just watched a few days or weeks ago. It's been like this for a couple of years now, and I think it's time for me to see a physician. Thank you!","Thank you for the prompt reply. I will try my primary care and go from there.


 They don't have docs solely for memory loss issues. I would recommend you start with your family doctor first and go from there. Good luck!"
Duration of lack of sleep stage,"My gma has gone into non sleep mode now for abt 7 or 8 months, it goes for days and then she gets one night sleep with or without the help of sedatives and then back again to lack of sleep. Needless to say this is taking it's heavy toll on my mum who is her main caregiver ( and is 65 herself) , my question is how long does it usually take for this stage? Is there a subsequent stage when she will get more sleep or is it downhill from here on?","I'm afraid that sometimes people will never change from this stage. I knew someone who wandered all night until she died. It might be time to think about a home for everyone's sake.


 I know with my gma, seditives have the adverse affect on her. It can vary from person to person. You can try natural things in the mean time, take her on outings and keep her engaged with activities (puzzles, favorite show, movie, a meal out, visiting friends, reading a book to her, baking, cooking, so on) and you can give her maybe some sleepytime tea towards bedtime."

 Erwin, Many of the foods you listed as the ones you eat are major gas producers. If you use the link below, it goes to a good PDF article on dealing with gas. It lists the food and whether they are low, moderate or high gas producers. It also lists other strategies for reducing gas.

Will they really keep her alive?,"My nan is 91 and has advanced Alziemers. She has been in a special care home for nearly 2 years. She is aggressive, has no memory, doubly incontinent and is heavily medicated to calm her down when the carers have to wash her (several times a day). This morning she fell and has fractured her hip. She is in hospital awaiting surgery this afternoon. I'm amazed they would even attempt surgery and wonder if they would ever just let her slip away while under anesthetic? The thought of her trying to recover from this is horrendous. The home can barely cope with her anyway so she will never go back there. It seems so cruel our respected and loved elderly have to suffer like this.","Yes, my dad has power of attorney and she does have a do not recusitate. I just think its so crazy as if it were an animal we would have had it put to sleep. Well, its wait and see if she comes round from the op now.


 Well she has survived the surgery. There are no details yet, mum and dad are going to see her tonight. It leaves the nhs to cope with a frightened old lady who will deficate in her bed several times a day and usually takes 4 or 5 people at the care home to get her cleaned up ( she doesnt think its ger mess). Im so worried the nurses will hate her and leave her to it because shes so unpleasant, but obviously not her fault. They just dont have the staff for her. I want to phone them up to say be nice to her!


 Yes we are UK. Apparently her home may actually have her back which would be the best option as she may find something familiar in that.


 I am so sorry. I hope that I am never like that. I would much rather be let to pass away.


 Hello Zara1: Watching a loved one go thru all they can go thru is cruel ... but hopefully the patient has very limited ability to understand what's going on. I had a grandmother, just over 20-years ago who died while in one of the more archaic homes for alzheimers. She was about 4'-11"" and spitting mad with or during much of her last year in that home. My mother has been in an assisted living home for dementia and parkinsons for 13-months now ... after living at home for 15-months with a 24/7 caregiver. I have watched her fade, especially the past few months - not violent yet, but that could happen .... but I see fear. And I think it's fear of feeling alone. She just turned 96 last month. I can't imagine anyone in the health industry would just let her die ... but does she or did she have any kind of an assignment for health power of attorney? If she has a ""do not recusitate (spell?)"" .... it might be the best for her pain management ... and provide the least amount of guilt for any family member. Best wishes to you and yours. Rob and Gizzy


 Yes, I'm dealing with this same thing with my Mom -- she has kidney failure and sleeps all day and her back is really painful. I'm trying to talk my sister's into getting pallative care or hospice care -- after all, what are the docs going to try and do, save her? She's 85, but doctors are into saving lives, not creating comfort. At this point I'd rather see her comfortable and out of pain which is what the pallative and hospice care would do. If your Dad has power of attorney and health care directive, he can step in and stop the madness. My Dad was in the hospital with advanced cancer, and they kept trying to give him blood transfusions, even though he had a do not rescuitate and no heroics. I came in one day and talked to the nurse outside the room...told them to stop. He needs comfort now, not life saving techniques. I'd rather that so-badly needed blood go to someome that was in dire straits...I know, sounds awful, but my Dad felt the same way. You are right, we are much kinder to our animals sometimes. How does your Dad feel about your Nan having the surgery?


 Well, the surgery is done, and I hope she does well recovering, poor thing. It sounds like you are in the UK? Thinking about you and your family.


 I certainly hope so, this must be so hard for your family. Hugs to all of you.


 Just an update. Nan is still in hospital, refusing any medication or physio, but managing with help to get to her chair. Se seems slightly better for no doping meds although they are having to manage her behaviour gently and slowly which must be so very frustrating for the nurses who must have other things to do. Mum and dad are very pleased with the care. We are waiting to find out where she will go as the home she was in have refused her back. She's not eating much, just snacking on a biscuit now and again. Apparently still got a firm grip in her hand though!"
Alzheimer's and insomnia,"Hi everybody My grandma has alzeihemer's and she does not sleep, she can go for 2 days without sleep, sedatives work for a while and then they stop, any ideas ?","When she does sleep, does she keep regular hours - sleeping at night and awake during the day? My FIL got them turned around frequently. Have you tried something like Xanax or Valium for her? We tried Xanax for my FIL, but it didn't work so well, but the Valium - even though it was low dose, did the trick!"
Eosinophillic Fasciitis,"May 6, 2013 I entered a toxic environment house of a client (a ""Hoarder's Home"") with no protective gear on just trying to be helpful and as a result ended up with this very rare diagnosis. I have found this website so helpful in symptoms of the horrible Prednisone I am on and thought perhaps there might be others out there who have this medical diagnosis or have even heard of it. Dizziness, tooth sensitivity, blurred vision, dry eyes, dry mouth, shakiness,horrible headaches in addition to the medical condition symptoms of swelling, pain, itchiness, hardened tissue, loss of range of motion, stiffness, tightness like a blood pressure cuff on it's last squeeze! Treatment started in August 2013 with 60mg of Prednisone and Physical Therapy 3 times a week, compression stockings and compression sleeves to assist the Prednisone and Physical therapy to keep the swelling at bay. Physical Therapist are awesome and also do lymphatic massage. October 27th was the last taper from 40mg to 30mg and it apparently was too fast in that all the symptoms came back again so now am back on 40mg tapered to 37.5mg and on Dec 3rd to 35mg. Every blogI have read has people who have had this medical condition for years and have had contractures etc that are fiercely depressing. I am supposed to be treated for a year and this is supposed to be gone. Am hoping there may be others out there who are on this site possibly like me or at least who have this condition that are not a permanent disability!","Birt, Welcome To Healing Well! I am not familar with Eosinophillic Fasciitis, so I used google. From the sounds of it, but do please correct me if I am wrong, it is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation. Treatment happens to be chemotherapic agent medications (autoimmune suppressants) from what I see too. I don't have this particular problem, however, I have necrotizing gramultous inflammation pseudotumor and Wegener's Disease. When I first got sick, I was treated agressive. I was on long-term high dosages of prednisone, given radiation and put on chemotherapy agent medications. I surely understand your frustration and why it gets depressing. I had and still do have so many mixed emotions about it. The prednisone was extremely hard on my body, as it is a medication that should not be used long term actually. I went from 238 lbs to 340 lbs, developed purple strea (sp), hot flashes, moon face, muscle cramps, muscle spasms, glucose readings (bloodsugars, as I am diabetic) went haywire including having to be put on insulin, extreme fatigue. The bright side is when I got off prednisone all those side effects went away, and I went from the 340 lbs to 210 lbs. From reading on medicine cabinet, it looks like the treatment is extremely similar to mine. Right now I am being treated with Methotrexate Injections, Folic Acid, Flexiril, Gabapentin, Morphine, Percocet. I feel like I could open a pharmacy with all the crap I have to take! Has the DR suggested radiation to help shrink the inflammation? You can get only so much radiation in your body, so they use a term called ""life-time"". My location is behind my left eye. They gave me life time radiation of left eye. It just means I can't radiate more on my eye. I do not know if it will help you, but it helped me a lot. Do you go to a specialist? I am very interested in hearing about this disease you have. If you don't have a specialist, I always suggest teaching hospitals. For example, I go to OHSU, Oregon Health and Sciences University. I have found teaching hospitals have more specialists, newer medical equipment, newer testing, state of art medical training, the current medical training, and if you can't pay for it the hospital usually writes it off if you can't even do a payment arrangement. I signed a waiver for my doctor stating he can bring in interns, other doctors, visiting doctors, out of country doctors and so on. I decided because I am 1 of 500,000 people to get this problem if I could at least help one patient to not be the guinea pig I am, it is worth it. The drs will know how to treat it then."
First time visit to a secure dementia unit !  Does it get easier ?,"Dad has had dementia for 5 years , recently had a bowel operation and he is declining fast so we now have to put him in a dementia unit. I saw a lady in the late stages which terrified me and it was so clinical .it is the only place available . Am I just in shock or is this what the norm is ? The staff were nice .","Thank you , the problem is he is suffering sundowning and gets violent . So we have tried him at home and it was too hard on mum.i am not sure of round the clock care as very expensive


 He was on something with a t a yellow wafer


 Hopefully you can find a suitable solution. I wish you all the best!


 Placing your loved one in a nursing facility is a heartbreaking task. Sorry you and your family are enduring this difficult transition. There are a few things you need to do asap: if you have the Power of Attorney, request that the facility give you a copy of the Physician's Orders. This is a listing of all medications, and standing orders for every treatment that has been ordered along with the frequency and duration of each treatment. If you're not the POA, ask that person to request the Physician's Orders. With that in hand, you'll know which medications are being used. Look each one up online, download information and keep it in binder so you can refer to it. If you're not sure why each medication is being given, call the charge nurse and ask. The thing about meds is that they are often misused. Alzheimer's patients are like you and me--medications leave them feeling sickly. Many times, getting 1:1 companionship and assistance for your loved one will deter the behaviors. Don't forget, persons with Alz. suffer from diminished ability to communicate with words. But they CAN and DO communicate, with their behavior. Behavior isn't merely good or bad; through behavior, the person with Alz. is telling us something. Our job is to figure out what that person is trying to tell us. It's not easy, but if you observe carefully, this can be done. Once you know what's wrong, you'll be in a better position to correct the issue. Also, there ARE long term care facilities that use psychotropic meds sparingly. They're not easy to find, but they ARE around. With high staff to resident ratios and a ton of engaging activities, persons with Alz. are able to function at their fullest, without medications! Believe me, if I had it to do over, I'd find this kind of facility for my mother and place her there. So, do me a favor--do this for your loved one. My thoughts and prayers are with you.


 I don't recall if your dad was having difficulty swallowing before he went to the hospital, but, regardless, check to see if swallowing issues are a side effect of any of the meds he's on. Check the same for aggressiveness. Also, what is his oxygen intake like? Low oxygen can also cause violent episodes, panic, etc. Running away almost makes sense, given his situation--we are hard-wired for flight vs. fight. Don't forget, hospitals aren't equipped to deal with this type of behavior, except with meds. Transferring him to a dementia unit may provide him the respite he needs, given the staff there knows how to help him. Be sure to make an appt. to speak with the charge nurse before he gets to the unit. This will be a step toward establishing a solid working relationship; it also demonstrates your commitment to his care. If you're not happy with what this unit has to offer, find another situation for him, preferably before he's discharged from the hospital.


 How do I. Know about the oxygen intake


 Here are a couple more possibilities: 1) is your dad dehydrated? Ask the staff how much liquid he's had since his surgery. They should be able to give you a day by day report. Dehydration is a huge problem, particularly among the elderly. Having said that, not drinking 5-8 glasses of water/day will affect anyone, not just those who are elderly. 2) Might your dad have a urinary track infection? UTIs can cause very difficult behaviors. If your dad hasn't been tested for a UTI, ask the staff to do so. Given all the possibilities we've been discussing, don't forget what Sherri said: that undergoing surgery and coming out of anesthesia can be very confusing, esp. for someone with dementia. Also, in the elderly, it takes longer for the anesthesia to wear off, so your dad may be suffering from side effects of that. The effects of the anesthesia together with the side effects of whichever other meds he's taking may be contributing to his behavior.


 Thanks everyone Yes I saw them put a clip on his finger ,but he refused it . Mum is in her late 70's very healthy but also very tiring for her so we help with cooking her meals and staying with dad .i looked up 7 stages of Alzheimer's and dad is at 6 . I went back o the dementia unit and felt a bit better about it they staff have been there for a very long time which I thought was a good sign . I spoke to my brother of my concerns and he just says the home will be good as dad will have his own doctor and they will sort out the meds there . Dad goes on Tuesday my brother wants him to go in an ambulance I thought that might frighten him Dad is 80


 Interesting that your dad does better taking liquids when they are thickened--this is a great strategy! It's important that he takes in sufficient liquids; if this is the way in which he get liquids into him, keep it up. I'd also ask for a swallow evaluation; that way, if and when he's transferred to another facility, the information concerning his swallow function will be included with his reports. Between his behavior and the dark concentration of his urine, it sounds as though he is dehydrated. Dehydration and also cause medication reactions...which might explain some of the behavior you've described. Keep up the good work; you're making good inroads.


 When my gma had her bladder removed, her kidneys started to shut down and she ended up with a nephrostomy tube coming out of her back. Every 6 months she would have to go in and have it replaced. Each replacement was harder on her mentally as the years went by. People with dementia have a hard time with anesthesia and pain medication. It highly disorientating to them. Your dad may bounce back a little when he recovers but unfortunately there is no guarantee. And yes, there are other options available. Once he recovers from his surgery, he can go home with you or another family member, you can hire a full time care giver that can go to his house, if he lives alone, he can go into an assisted living center that caters to dementia patients. But whatever you do, please do not put him in a nursing home. Nursing homes are very institutional and can be an unfriendly place.


 Is he on medication to help stabilize his sundowners? Such as Namenda?


 I hated the place , it was horrible I have just woken from a nightmare about it .i have written to my brother about any alternative


 Thank you , it is such a worrying time


 He is still in the general hospital at the moment and is having really bad days . Mainly wanting to escape Up all night Trouble with swallowing Violent episodes I will find out today the meds he is one and yes look them up He is meant to go to the dementia hospital on Tuesday and every fibre of my being hate it ...thank you everyone for advice


 OMG , it sounds so technical ! Of course it does we are dealing with a persons life !!! I phoned my brother with all these questions in a previous post and he diddnt want to know He is going to New York tomorrow for work from Australia and will be away for the transgression from the hospital to the secure dementia unit. I had big honest talk today and he just said the home would be better as he will have his own doc , etc Thank u for helping me , Yes ,my hank you so much .i went against to the unit again today and one of the nurses I knew indirectly , I tried to form some sort of personal bond that dad is my loved one . Thank u


 Re: Oxygen intake: ask your dad's nurse what his oxygen level is. They should check this when they check his blood pressure; they usually put a clothespin like object on one of his fingers to get a reading. Good oxygen intake gives a reading in the 90's, but google this to be sure (this is part of being an advocate; doing the research and becoming informed lends authority to your questions, which, in turn, causes the staff to take notice and respond accordingly). BTW, if the nurse doesn't know what his oxygen level is, ask her/him to check it.


 To Captainchrissie: I don't recall seeing your Dad's age ... or the health of your Mother. But, irregardless of both, care for your Dad will be demanding. It may be too much for your Mother to handle even after his surgery recovery period. And whether it's in his own home with 24/7 trained care or in an assisted living enveronment for dementia, it will be expensive too. One thing for certain, as someone else here said, a ""nursing home"" is likely the last place you would want to see him go. As painful as it may be, you want to visit a number of facilities for care and try your best to evaluate them. Since your Dad is still in the hospital, you have a little time but probably not much - unless he could go into a rehab facility for a few weeks before needing to go into a more permanent place. However, few rehab facilities are equipped to handle dementia patients. There is, I'm afraid a good deal of research ahead ... but it's needed to make the best decisions for your Dad - and your Mom. From what I read here, the POA (power of attorney) would be good for you to have - at least the medical POA, if your Mother has a hard timemaking decisions. The blood oxygen level may be more necessary for an Alzheimers patient than a Dementia patient. Ask your doctor. A brief background of my experience and medical conditions: I have had COPD for over 5-years, so I'm very familiar with the blood oxygen level. In fact, I have my own meter I use occasionslly at home. It's a very simple quick procedure, and in my case - when I have my blood pressure checked, they check my blood/oxygen level at the same time - because I have COPD. That's essentiallyObstructive Pulmonary Disease caused by Emphysema. Last Saturday, when I was at my Psychologist, I asked him specifically what the difference was between Alzheimers and Dementia. There is a substantial difference in cause, in treatment and sometimes even in age of diagnosis. I asked because my Mother has been suffering with Dementia for over three years now ...how much more ... we'll never know, because she hid it so well. Her trip started officially on Easter of 2011. She had been living alone for over 15-years (since my Father died) and was still driving in a limited way as late as 2011 when she was 93-years old. She fell in her own kitchen on Easter Sunday. I found out, and met her neighbor at the hospital that morning. After three weeks in the hospital for observation mostly, her doctor said she can go home - but not alone. she has to have a licensed and insured 24/7 caregiver ... which we did. My house is a 40-mile round trip, and it's a two-story - so movingin with me was not an option even with a caregiver hired. Then, she is a very independant person ... refused to leave herhome ... so for the 15-months, she lived with a caregiver and I was over once or twice a week plus on the phone daily. Last August, the Dementia got worse .... episodes in the middle of the night and slightly violent. She was admitted into the hospital because she insisted someone in her house, late at night, was trying to kill her. She was under observation for over 4-weeks, and then I was told she could not go back home - even with a caregiver. They did not have the medical expertise to handle her at this point. And so, my search for a place for her started. I went to 6 different places, two of them were equipped (I thought) for her. then one of them called me back and said, after looking at her hospital records, they would not be equipped for her - but they did give me a recommendation And that is where she is now ... and has been since September of 2012. It is an Assisted Living Home for Dementia and Parkinsons patients. It is infinitely better than the one ""nursing home"" I went to see and not much more expensive. It is the closest, in its physical presence, to a large home ... actually 4 large homes - each with a capacity of 20 patients max. They have terrific programs there to stimulate the mind. They do not allow the residents to just wither away in their rooms in front of a TV alone. I did a financial study recently, and I found that it actually was costing a little more money for Mom to have a live-in caregiver at her ownhome than living in this Assisted Living Home. But - she was alone, except for the caregiver - and only one SS check and partial pension check was coming in. There's no question about it ... either is an expensive proposition. In my Mom's case, her lifetime savings have been going for over two years now - and will not last much longer. Since her home had been sitting there for nearly a year unoccupied ... I decided to sell it months ago. The closing was two weeks ago ... and now her new bank account has enough in it to keep her at the Assisted Living Home for close to three more years. Difficult decisions ...... maybe too hard for your Mother to make. In both of their best interests ..... you probably should have Power of Attorney for both medical and property. And that's a tough thing to face too. I know, I had to do it! Good luck on your decison-making ... and to your family. Rob


 They are always saying his urine is too concentrated . He refuses to drink much , I read about thickening the liquid a bit and that helps"
Mixed Feelings,"I was out of town this week, doing dr appts 350 miles away and visiting family and friends. I went to see a dear friend in a facility that has dementia. He is like a father to me. The state of his health has alarmed me. I spoke to the nurse - and she said his daughter was his power of attorney, and handling all care despite the facility advising he needs to be on certain meds and his daughter is refusing it. I visited 10 minutes with him, he had just got out of bed to see me, and had to get back into bed after 10 minutes. A few months ago, I called his daughter and asked for her father's phone number as I had got a new phone and for some reason it did not transfer over. She deleted my friend status on facebook, and never returned my call. She is cutting me out of the picture, and litterly from what I saw is waiting for her father to pass. I don't have the money to fight her in court for power of attorney but I have to do something. She isn't getting him the medical attention he needs, failing to get medicines the nurses say he needs, not looking out of him what so ever. He refused his lunch, saying it wouldn't agree with him. It was only 1/4 cup soup and a half sandwhich. He lost over 100 lbs from what I saw. What can I do? How can I get him a power of attorney what will provide what he needs? I did ask the nurse if he was sound of mind enough to change power of attorneys, and sadly he is not. Does anyone else have some advice?","I figured I'd be a stranger as I am not next to kin. I know his son and him are not talking, maybe I should clue him in and try to get an ally? I will call the hotline, and thank you for that.


 I could actually see my friend chose the cycle of life over a ton of pills. I have mixed feelings because I believe there is a fine point of life and comfort til the day verses pain within life til the day. He has restless leg syndrome and dementia. I believe, however, not sure as the nurse did not say what meds he should be on, the medication was for his restless leg syndrome. I believe on the fact of how restless his legs were (they shook a lot), and how fatigued he was. I am a very strong willed, caring, loving person and I of course love all my friends dearly. My friend is older, but like a grandfather. My maternal grandfather passed away when I was not even ten years of age, and my paternal grandfather had dementia since I can remember til he passed on a month ago, today. The grandfather part came from this friend, and it is probably the special bond and friendship that just tears me seeing this happen to him. Paternal grandfather was a touchy one to get close to, and I happened to be the only grandkid to get close to him within the last few years. It was a common factor, and he amazed me with stories on end. I had my army pt shirt on, and he asked me if I had served (LOL, have to love the dementia part). I heard stories of his service, in WWII. It was real interesting. Sorry for being off track, but the bond between family is strong for me, and my friend whom is like a grandfather is family in heart. Thats why I want him to have the best care ever.


 You'll probably have a hard time getting power of attorney if a close family member objects, Smurfy. Courts would view you as a ""stranger."" If you feel he is being abused or neglected, report him to the Adult Abuse hotline in his state. Their authority is strictly defined, but they can intervene if a neglect allegation is confirmed.


 Smurfy, I'm not trying to sound mean, but perhaps the daughter is doing what her father asked, and not providing any heroics for him. There is a point where meds aren't going to help the situation. I'm not sure what meds the facility says she is not providing, but remember they might be looking at profit as well. The reason I say this is because my Mom who also has dementia all of the sudden stopped eating (although she never ate very much) and the woman who a month ago walked around with the aid of a walker is down to 80 lbs., and very weak. Trust me, she has a very loving family who monitors her daily by being up at the home. It was the staff at the facility who suggested to my sisters that we bring in Hospice. I try and get down once a month to see her, and her condition this time was alarming. I was shocked to see the her so small and withdrawn laying in bed. There is no malice -- just the cycle of life. I can't say for sure if your good friend's daughter is not treating her father poorly, but as Judy said, the hotline is a good way to ensure that he is not being abused. I just thought I'd give you another scenario from a family that is totally caring for their mother.


 I hear you SmurfyShadow. He sounds like a wonderful man, and created a very nice relationship for both of you. He definitely deserves the best care possible, and I love that you are there being an advocate for him."
Alzheimer's,"Hi, I am new on here. I seem to have nobody to talk to, at least not someone who would understand. My father is 89 years old and has been in a very nice nursing home for 7 or more months. I love my Dad so much and at first I started going to see him almost every day. He seemed like I was helping a little. My step mother and I are the only close relatives so we started going every other day and that went well for awhile. Then I started going and he doesn't know me, walks off from me looking for someone else or just sitting not talking at all. I have truly been devastated by this...I have had servere depression for years. I sit in there with him and end up crying, even though I try not to. I have health problems COPD and cannot drive myself. My husbands takes me and either waits or picks me up later. By the time I get out of there I am hardly breathing, tears eyed and my mouth feels like sand is in it. dry and can hardly move. I have been in the hospital 2 different times for attempted suicide. I am feeling suicidal and put off going to see him.....then I feel guilty for not going to see him and even get more depressed. I am responsible for watching my grandchildren...one who is 3 weeks, 4 years and two older ones while their parents work. I want no part of getting down again. My family couldn't handle it if they found out. They have already put up with too much from me. I still see a mental health dr. On a regular basis but trying to get through this without too much drama I find this altizmers simply worse than death...my father is there but yet he is gone. I have dealt with all kind of issues and I am 63 years old but I cannot deal with my Daddy in this state. I am a real mess...I want to help him but I feel like I am such a terrible daughter. I love my Dad so much. I am hopeless. Susie WV E","Your post made me feel like you truly understand. I guess that is all I needed to know that someone does understand me. I haven't gone for a couple of days and I have decided to have shorter visits and have a different outlook. Thank you for caring.


 I hear you - and I've been there! Please vent about it! There's not much very comforting i could say - except I have too good of an idea of what you're going thru. That may be of some comfort! My Mother just passed two months ago - while in an Assisted Living Home for Dementia and Parkinsons for 16-months. And before that, she did have a 24/7 caregiver in her own home for 15-months. Her diagnosis was dementia just before the 24/7 caregiver started - when she was in a hospital after falling down at home - and being virtually helpless to get up herself. I too have COPD ... so i know the limitations that one can be under ... and how stress can magnify those limitations. If you're on albuterol, I would certainly take it just as you're starting your visit with your Dad. The albuterol typically lasts 2 to 3-hours and starts working within a minute or two. If you're taking Spiriva and/or Advair - I would certainly take those the morning of visiting. I'm on both daily - and they work well. I'm also a cancer patient - so I am on chemo and HT on an ongoing basis. My Mother passed peacefully and with the help of hospice - even while she was in the Assisted Living. Her memory was a long spiral downward over the years - and yes ..... it does hurt to watch that happen. I know! If you can, try not to blame anyone for this .... and try to accept it as a cruel situation that you must deal with or tolerate. It is the cruelest to the survivor - and not the patient at some point. In the meantime, please try to continue with professional counseling help. Medication may be needed ... but think of it as - if you can't function, then you can't do anything for your Dad either. Or for that matter, the rest of your family. Sorry you are going thru this ... but you're not alone there ... too many of us are or have been already! Peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo


 Hello again .... Just a few short thoughts: I was visiting my Mother once a week - seldom more often. And about every two months, I would bring my dog to see her too. The facility was very strong in pet therapy - and they had ""house dogs"", so an visitor was encouraged to bring their dog - especially if the patient knew that dog. At the end, Mom though I was bringing her dog to see her. She and her husband used to breed and show dogs, so her timeframe was about 30 to 40-years displaced by then. I think it's far better to visit less often - but to bring a positive attitude with you. And .... don't ever blame yourself for any of this! I did put together for Christmas of 2012, a collage of photos to hang up in her room. There were about 12-photos covering her parents long ago - all the way up to a photo of a year ago. First, I think it made her feel more comfortable being in a strange room. Then, it covered about 40-years of her life - good memories and for something for her to relate to daily. Keep loving ... but no guilt ... OK! Rob & Gizmo"

Research Survey (please read and participate),"Hi everyone, This is my first post here, so please let me introduce myself! My name is Kyle, and I am a student of psychology at the University of Southern California (USC). I'm currently trying to get a paper done (and possibly published) for one of my research methods classes on the effects of exercise on cognition in people with Alzheimer's. I've been helping my mom take care of my grandfather since was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 8 years ago and despite the fact that my grandfather has slowly gotten worse mentally as time passes, I've personally noticed significant changes in his demeanor when he got out and exercised on a semi-regular basis which piqued my interest in the matter. Anyway, as part of the paper, I've had to come up with a survey that asks about Alzheimer's and exercise habits and I need to gather survey responses to finish tabulating data and finish my paper. It would mean the world to me if you guys could take 5 minutes out of your day and take my survey! It's completely anonymous and it would really help me get some possible Alzheimer's research done Thank you in advance! https://usc.qualtrics.com/SE/? SID =SV_4YPhadxlTRpB8Fv Post Edited (Kyle Y) : 4/17/2014 4:34:26 PM (GMT-6)","(https://usc.qualtrics.com/SE/?Sid=SV_4YPhadxlTRpB8Fv) please change the SID in the link to capital SID in CAPITAL LETTERS, i think the autoformatting has been redirecting my survey to a incorrect page link) Please please please take this survey if you have a chance. At the moment, I only have 25 of the 50-100 survey responses that I currently need. If I'm able to get enough data and do well with this paper and data, I may have the means to eventually do more studies on Alzheimer's in the future!

 https://usc.qualtrics.com/SE/?Sid=SV_4YPhadxlTRpB8Fv The link should be above. If the SID in the link itself comes up as lowercase when I post this link (e.g. https://usc.qualtrics.com/SE/?Sid=SV_4YPhadxlTRpB8Fv) please correct it by capitalizing the three letters SID that come before the string of letters and numbers at the end of the link Thanks!


 Chotti said... Still had no luck. The link shown had many research projects. Sorry the last Half of the address is not found. I'm not sure why this is happening. Chotti, can you show me what happens when you click the link? /usc.qualtrics.com/SE/?Sid=SV_4YPhadxlTRpB8Fv


 Okay, got it! So basically here's what you do. I think the autoformatting on the forum keeps changing a certain part of the link. Basically, this part that I've bolded of the link https://usc.qualtrics.com/SE/? SID =SV_4YPhadxlTRpB8Fv needs to be capitalized for the link to work. I'm not sure why it changes when I post it here, but I know that that is the reason the link keeps failing. EDIT: Apparently bolding the area of the link has fixed the problem by keeping that segment capitalized. If you copy/paste the link into your browser, it should work. Thank you guys so much for bearing with me! It's been really tough trying to troubleshoot this whole process over the last few days and your patience is much appreciated!


 Thank you very much for taking my survey, Chotti! It's really helping me out. If anyone else is able to take my survey, please do! I've finally fixed the link and I'm hoping to get more participants in the next few days before I have to close the survey!


 Hi Kyle, Glad u got ur link to the survey fixed. I hope many will participate. Just wanted to add a little more thought to the survey if ok. My mother was a active hiker, gardener, worked her entire life until she could no more. Arthritis set in & robbed her from a active life style. She could not exercise due to bone loss & severe arthritis pain. She could only walk with a walker. She also had diabetics,dementia, HBP & congenital heart failure, very young in her early 60's. Some things are hereditary. Sometime the body goes long before the mind. Keeping the mind active is the key in my opinion... I have seen it in many of my relatives who can't walk or lift a gallon of milk but their minds are sharpe. Many of my relatives lived to their late 90's by themselves still drove yet weak, had all their faculties, bodies failed them long ago, so there is more at work. The mind holds the secret. The mind stays active longer.....will that help when the body fails? Individual as the choice in colors. So many variables. Sometimes it's not a choice to become inactive. Aging and arthritis & other physical health issues makes movement impossible due to pain & illness as the body ages. I watched a strong woman become broken by bone& joint disease,many types of arthritis issues which broke down her body preventing much activity. We took long rides and trips . That was the best medicine of all...

 Tried to locate UR link... No luck. Sorry! Try to submit the whole correct link. THANKX


 Still had no luck. The link shown had many research projects. Sorry the last Half of the address is not found.


 Kyle, this is what your hotlink in your most recent post leads to: ""Activate an optimized version of the page designed specifically for Jaws version 11 and greater. The URL is incorrect. Please double check the URL and try again."" I grabbed this from the screen.


 Yeah Kyle u got the link right. All I did was copy the link onto my browser and the USC page for Alzheimer's research came right up... Easy to do and fill out the very thoughtful questions. Good luck & let us know how UR research program works out... Thank you so much for the patience to get this page thru...to us.... It was so worth all the effort.... Peace, luv & Healing


 I took the survey for you. I actually work in a Memory Care unit and know many people with all forms of dementia. I took the survey thinking about one resident in particular. I think this survey is a great idea, but I don't think of Alzheimer's as a ""disease"". Our bodies age, why not our brains? But our bodies decline more gracefully if we take care of ourselves, so it would make sense that we should take care of our brains as well! :) Thanks, Kyle"
What do you tell a  person you suspect has Alzheimer's?,"My wife, 70, is have extraordinary problems with her memory, such as not recalling a movie we both watched and enjoyed a few weeks ago. She has always been a worrier, but lately that has taken on larger dimensions. Her mother, who died at 94, suffered some form of dementia for a couple of years before her death, and my wife is afraid of that happening to her. My question is this: Should I tell my wife what I suspect and open up a new problem to worry about , or, because Alzheimer's is incurable, should I stay silent at least until there are more pronounced symptoms? Can Alzheimer's be diagnosde in its early stages, and if so, are there treatments that can prolong quality of life? Thanks, Moorloch","Hello ....... I would hesitate to tell her by using either the names of alzheimers or dementia. At least when it comes to dementia, one of the first symptoms noticeable after some memory loss is ""distrust"" developed. You should absolutely bring her into a doctor for a diagnosis ... and maybe you could use some reason other than an implication of a memory disease. Example: My Mother recently passed from Dementia three months ago. Her Mother over 20-years ago had passed from complications of alzheimers. My Mother had a tremendous fear of that disease watching her Mother die after years of continuing downturns. I hinted at her having Dementia twice - long after it was diagnosed by a doctor and she was in a home for dementia and parkinsons! Of course, she refused to believe it. Then, I said no more about it. What good would it have done for her to believe she has what she was so afraid of. I have been told by nurses at her home - and later by the nurse from hospice, that Namenda does work well in the earlier stages but not that well in the later stage of dementia. Please seek a doctor ... try to put together a question list ... and remember that patients are differ to some extent, so don't generalize too much. Peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo


 If you suspect that your wife is having some sort of dementia issues, yes you should bring it up to her and take her to the doc for testing. Yes, AD can be diagnosed early and if she does have it, she can be placed on medication to help slow down the progression. The more pronounced the symptoms, the harder it is to ""reel"" in.


 I worked with Alz pts for years and I guarantee you that memory loss is NOT NOT NOT the foremost symptom of Alzheimers... I have a friend who is now 89 and she only lives in the moment but for two years has been totally confused (and her dead kin folks visit her daily) ... but she does NOT have Alzheimers. I get very just plain angry with drs who are so quick to label memory problems or confusion as Alzheimers... if you have ever seen end of 2nd stage or 3rd stage Alz...I promise you, you know exactly what I am talking about !"
Amantadine and improvement in talking,Has anyone taken this or given this to a family member that got better in talking? My mom was practically a mute a week ago but since starting on Amantadine she's blurting words out left and right. I heard people take this for fatigue but in my mom's case she sleeps 20 hours a day so I wanted to wake her up. it's doing it a little bit but more so in stimulating her brain to make her talk. Down side is she's having a lot of trouble walking now. Her legs go weak and drops easily.,"Hi Kumar, The drug is called Amantadine. It is used for the flu and Parkinsons. If your mother is taking Namenda for her dementia then this drug should not be used together. This is why I had to stop. It also made my mom very weak. It's a choice of whether you want her to talk and not walk or walk and not talk. I chose walk so she has now stopped talking again."
Questions re: late stages of AD,"This is my first time posting. My father in law is 78 and he was Diagnosed about two years ago with AD. He has been Progressing quickly and as of lately he has really gone ""Down hill"". He has been in and out of rehab two times Due to pressure wounds. (He hasnt been able to walk Due to hip/feet/leg issues) he has also been in the hospital Twice due to surgery for his pressure wounds. He was living in an assisted living home but he can not go back bc he needs a higher level of care. Being that his routine has been changing and he's been In and out of different places he seems very confused, more than normal. He does not eat on his own anymore, he pockets his food so he is on a purée diet. He really Can not do anything at all on his own. He doesn't speak much and when he does he whispers. He also sleeps a lot. As if recent he is not interested in anything at all such as the TV ( he used to want it on even though he didn't follow it) he also hardly speaks to us. Instead he has just been staring at us With an angry look on his face. He only has our family, which is Myself, his son and our four children. Other family Members have chosen to not be part of his life or help with Anything for that matter. If has been a big struggle as He is financially dependent on us for some time now. My question is ; does this seem like late stages and what Is the average progression at this point. He sometimes knows Our names but lately it seems he may not. He was seeing a neurologist but being That he is bed bound and it's been very hard to move him we haven't been able to see the neurologist in about 6 months. Any help, advise would be greatly appreciated.","In the last, or 3rd stage of Alzheimers, the pt is seldom able to talk at all, or constantly repeats the same thing. They may be physically healthy for quite awhile... many just keep walking and walking and walking. Generally forget how to feed themselves. Hallucinations may be common. They do not recognize even the closest relatives...and trying to 'reason' with them brings nothing but frustration to everyone involved. They are usually incontinent. Some are combatitive... Many succumb to pneumonia, which thank all that is holy, the doctor will NOT treat aggressively. They become like zombies if they continue to live. This is what I believe with all my heart. I truly believe that when they are in that stage that their soul no longer inhabits their bodies and that they are blessedly free, in a peaceful dimension (whatever you call it) and that their bodies simply operate in brain-memory robot like behavior. Please know that regardless of what it looks like...it is MUCH worse for the loved ones during the 2nd and 3rd stages...and that the soul of the one with Alz is truly free and at peace. I truly hope I have not hurt or offended anyone by writing this... I only want it to help. I worked with Alz pts and know what it did to families. Sending you all love and understanding. Bettsann


 Thanks Carl. I appreciate that. It's a huge burden and breaks our hearts to see him this way. I feel for anyone going through this as it is so awful. I will certainly look for a support to call as I have many questions. Thanks again.


 Hello ..... I understand that there is a difference between alzheimers and dementia, but I believe many of the differences are usually small. My Mother passed away in January of this year - from Dementia. She was officially diagnosed with dementia about 3-years ago while in the hospital after falling down. Undoubtedly, it began much earlier. She was, for 15-months, back into her own home but with a doctor required 24/7 caregiver. Then, her last 16-months were in an Assisted Living for Dementia and Parkinsons - a terrific specialized Home. And that was a requirement by the hospital psychiatrist after one of her major evening hallucinations put her into the hospital. I feel for your partial family to have to deal with all the forms of support for your father-in-law. It isn't fair .... and it IS harder on the supporting people than on the patient - at least in my belief!!! In my Mothers case, she had money put away, so that it was not a financial burden on me - although by the end, her money was close to running out. For moral support, it was just me .... and at times, one of my daughters. But the other daughter washed her hands and continues to wash her hands of helping anyone - unless there's something in it for her. Toward the end, many of the reactions of my Mother were very similar to what you're saying about your FIL. The staff, at one point in late 2013, suggested that I bring in hospice for her. That organization was terrific. They were caring. They did not get into the way of either the Assisted Living staff or the primary doctor. They kept me informed - as often as I wished. And the purpose was to make her final days as pleasant and pain-free as possible. The hospice was paid for by medicare. The duration of hospice can be almost anything. In my Mothers case, it was close to three months. It can be much longer though often is not. I don't know that anyone could tell you if your FIL is nearing the end. I think it's safe to say he is in the later stages though. In my Mothers case, the AL staff was very careful NOT to give any kind of timeframe for her. But, when hospice is suggested - it's getting close. Hospice called me three times the day my Mother passed - to keep me informed - and to let me know that her time was very close. Swallowing food does often become very difficult. It was for her - and that often leads to difficult breathing and/or pneumonia at the end. I wish you and yours peace. Rob & Gizmo"
After 18 months I’m emotionally done with Mom,"I know many people reading this will understand the emotional rollercoaster I have been on since 'we'-my brother and I put my mother in a residential care home Sept 2012 at 79yrs . She is a old nurse and they say nurses and Dr's are the hardest to 'settle' in to a senior's home. I initially tried to get brother to look at moving her back home with 24hr/7 care and I would help manage her and I would live with her to introduce this new regime and caregiver to her-knowing this would be hard but if it didn't work then 'the home' may be considered. This idea flopped big time w brother, Dr.'s, gov't agents-even though a gerontologist helped develop my plan. I looked at the private care homes that take up to 8-9 residents- as long as residents don't wander. I don't think she would wander? but never tested her either. That plan was dismissed by brother as he didn't want to make any changes and it would cost more as it was private care. I eventually realized he wants to keep her estate intact. That was a big revelation. Before the gov't agents for our health care system proclaimed her 'unable to live on her own and they put her down for an 'emergency bed in Aug'12 my brother had spent much time reducing her income from investments so the gov't in Canada would charge her the minimum rate on her residential care home bed. Many people are in gov't beds in Canada that have many hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars worth of assets in their portfolios but pay $1,800 to a max of $3,800/mo. I find this disgusting when our system is so stressed and people without resources or advocates lie waiting in hospital beds for a gov't senior's home room and bed. Both brother and I had POA's for mother but after my attempts to try something different for our mom..even hiring private care helper to visit daily for one-on-one therapies and to keep her occupied and less anxious...my brother spent my mother's money to secure a 'committeeship' over her in Jan'14 so I have no say in my mother's care and no advocacy over her drug regime. I am allowed to see her so far but her bank card no longer works and the staff don't have to tell me even though they seem to want to keep me in the loop? I am waiting to be told one day that they can't talk to me as per my brother's order. Besides my mother living in a place she doesn't want to live 30-40% of her time my main concern is the 4-5 drugs they put her on once they took her in to the home against her will. Her calls to me are regular, as they are to my brother (who is close by) and he is good about taking calls and seeing her. But I have to keep lying to her when she calls and when asks me if I am coming to take her home I say yes, in the morning (I am 1hr away). This is the only way she will settle down. After I worked for months to get private care in daily for her 2 -4hrs a day my brother has given up on that now and of course the Dr. is increasing her antipsychotic again. Over 18mos Mom was on 1.5mgs/day of risperidone, then 1mg then .725mg then I got it down to .5mg where she wasnt as much a zoombie and now this week it is going back up to .725mg. She is also on two antidepressants (one for sleep). They are taking away her memory pill that she had been on for years. Mom is not psychotic(as her nurses confirm) only anxious about her living environment. When she comes to stay with me she has no anxiety except when 'preparing' to travel but says she wants to go back to the 'home' but I don't think she remembers what her senior's home is like-good things about loss of memory. Over the 1.5yrs Mom has gone down hill on the drugs and in the institution and looks like a very old frail lady who almost shuffles when she walks and her eyes are dark ringed and sunken. I believe the drugs are having a terrible impact on her overall health condition and they are not helping reduce her times of anxiety overall. They still have to give her PRN's of risperidone and haloperidol 5-8 times a month. Poor Mom. If the drugs actually stopped the anxious phone calls and her anxiety I maybe could feel better about them but they don't and if she becomes a zoombie again it will make me hesitant to visit her once a week. She is always happy when I visit her(or when anyone visits her) and we go out and do normal things and she doesn't complain about her living situation. But to visit a zoombie who still has anxiety at times and now has no extra private care coming it is going to send me even more overboard. I can't sleep when I think of her doped up and still sad and desperate at times. This is really just 'chemically restraining' her so that she is easier to handle for an overworked staff. I have just started working out with a personal trainer to get back in shape and I am hoping I can take time out from my guilt and worry to enjoy my own life, husband, dog and health..In 18mos I have not felt like exercising and have not been sleeping well. I feel like what has been happening to my mother has been happening to me. I wish she had someone with her all the time to keep her from getting anxious. drugs are not doing it! Any suggestions or people with similar stories? Pls tell me things will get better! I fear I am praying for her disease to take over and maybe if she doesnt remember her family I will feel better for her?","OMG! Al these stories are focused on housing and drugging our loved ones. Yet u all love UR elderly parents & want the very best....we will all get there sooner than u think... I found what I thought was a great adult home for my mother thru references from the local hospital. I was assured these were safe and caring places for the elderly who need constant supervision and medication on a regular basis. After interviewing three homes in our area my mother was happy to find one that fit her needs for privacy, her own furniture in a small area a special hospital bed and people that had the correct training and experience. I felt a great weight lifted all the worries seemed to pass. She was glad to have every meal prepared and clean cloths etc. she was very week. I would visit evey day for the first couple of months. Then I started witnessing inappropriate behaviors by the care givers. It all started to mount up with more and more as time went by. No one really checks on these homes on a regular basis. Once I understood the care errors I would bring mom home to stay with me for weeks then on days I could not would take her to the adult care home. I was in the middle of moving her back in with me full time as she pasted away before I could. I still feel guilt to this day that I could have done better. Yet I know the guilt is misdirected knowing all the circumstances to late to intervene she would not remember me . Yet I became a victim of the care system just as she did. I always wondered would she have had a better quality of life with me full time. I had spent the past 15 years taking care of all her needs. Would I be trained enough to recognize serious health issues she was facing? Or maybe I was trying to protect her from a system that was so indifferent to family care only the bottom line $$$ was needed. If I had recognized this sooner would it had made a difference in her quality of life. I think not. I did the best I could for years until health issues were no longer within my realm of responsibility I felt unqualified to handle. I believed she was getting better care 24/7. No one can predict the outcome under these complicated circumstances. Especially when all the ducks were in a row. The system failed. I hope I stay in my home until I pass. We all have the best intentions. Family members at times are the most difficult to deal with as we trust them to always do the right thing. This is not always the case. Sometimes there are so many issues and family members involved the whole issue of care becomes so convoluted. I have a stubborn streak I will never leave my home for any reason as long as I can find live in help for rent and a watchful eye of a trusted family member. Now is the time to start planning. There is great hope for a young family friend who grew up with our son, he can stay with us along with his wife rent free, to save for their new home. This is our future plan for our care. Legal papers are signed for both my husband and I. We have known and trusted this young friend for over 24 years. In fact he works as a caregiver in a group home for the past 15 years., and help around our home just as long. That is our wish and our children are fine with that decision which leaves them free to live there lives no worries about us. That is our gift to our children.


 I stumbled on this message and couldn't help to register and post a reply, as it annoys me so much the way psychoactive medicines are prescribed. My mother has been a victim of psychiatrist (with some help from her side), since she was so fond of prescript ions, psychiatric and nonpsichiatric. The medicines your mother is taking mekes me remember the prescript ion given to my mother in a psychiatric ward were she was admitted after suffering from an anxiety crisis. In the long term it turned out that the medicines she was already taking were the culprit of the crisis, and that providing her with even more of these toxics just made things worst. So she was not calmed, she still was anxious, but on top of this she was doped and acting as a zombie. Antipsychotics produced her parkinsonim (which in turns made her to fall and break first her shoulder and then her hip), plus some other movement disorders (dyskinesia and akathisia). Benzodiazepines, sleep pills and antidepressives just added to her confussion. Now she is not taking any medicine at all, and though there are some side effects that cannot been reversed, most of her symptoms and conditions improved. But I had to take the decisions on my own, cause Doctors are totally reluctanct to admit how wrong their treatments turn to be.


 Good question C, Yes she was. They must be classified to enter elder care homes. Each home offers different needs & are classified as such for different patients thru the hospitals. Staff are trained for each, as well as safety considerations, meds, diet etc. all included.There are laws in place to prevent improper placement. U are right and I totally understand what u r saying. I however, did not feel my mothers health was taken seriously. I will live with that and knowing too I was not responsible and found the best possible care available at that time. I was not trained for emergency care & we are located out in the country & live far from the closest medical care. I do sympathize with your mom as it is a huge responsibility for anyone. I am so sorry you had to watch ur mother & father. Yet it was a learning experience for us both, as hard as it was. It is a whole other issue in life & it can leave its scars. I took a lesson from my experience & will hope to do the best I can for my family, to relieve them of the burden of making those tough decisions. Never want them to ever think , ""If only"". Now they know it is our wish. Yet on the flip side the experience gives us a better understanding for our futures thru all the clouds in the sky it is blue, the rain subsides & the sun does shine so brightly once again and life does go on. Bless you & I feel ur struggles have heightened UR ability to truly share UR strength & kindness. Thank you !"
TexasTornadoDeb -- how are you?,Hey -- just checking in to see how you are doing!,"I thought I would post an update and see if anyone is familiar with what we are now going through. I ended up the end of December getting hospice for my father. He had forgotten so much, and having a nurse's aide come out every day was great for Dad and us. It was very difficult to give him a shower/bath. I asked the aide to come out early in the morning to give him a shower before breakfast because when his mind was well, he always showered before even coffee. The first time he was given that shower, he was SO happy! He was smiling all day. Unfortunately, Dad got where he had no control over this legs and so it was too hard for the aide to shower him instead giving him a sponge bath. The hospice group were awesome, nurses, doctors, etc. I have seen things I do not like with the home health care team and honestly did not expect so much. One day my father said that the couch was too hard and he wanted a hospital bed put in the living room. We had the hospice order one and it came within 24 hrs. He was comfortable, could sleep easier during the day, and he was still in an area of the house that we could all see him. It didn't seem to take long and Dad started a deep decline mentally and physically. Around Jan. 12th I called my brothers and told them Dad wouldn't last long and for them to come. They had not been around or helped the entire 2 years I was here. But, despite their lack of involvement, I knew they loved our parents. My eldest brother arrived on a Wednesday and was able to spend time with Dad and be fairly alert . My younger brother came on the next Friday and Dad didn't open his eyes or speak anymore. He passed away on January 19th, my mother's birthday. My mother seemed to handle it all better than expected. She seemed so strong. I had to stay strong too for her. So I really never cried, and have just looked after her. about 2 weeks ago my mother's health and Alzheimer's took a steep decline. I am very worried about her and no doctors are helping! She sprained her ankle and we are keeping it in a splint type cast and elevating it, as there is a lot of swelling. The odd thing is that there is no bruising or red marks. Besides having a sprained ankle, mom has had diarrhea, sores on her face and is very sensitive to pain over her entire body. Her potassium is extremely low; 2.4 with normal being 3.5-5.0. All her other blood work was perfect. She's on supplements, but I don't know how long they take to get her levels up to normal. She's also diabetic, but that too on Glucose test was perfect, so the Metformin the doctor had discontinued as they can upset the stomach. Took mom to her gastro dr too, and he took stool samples, .but it seems doubtful he knows anything as he hasn't called. Mom is scheduled to see him on the 17th. We keep seeing things that Dad did prior to passing from Mom now and it's scaring us. My parents were married for 58 years! She is remembering now more that he has passed. I am so afraid we'll lose her like Dad, and I always thought she'd live another 10 years at least. She's 77 now. If anyone knows anything this could be with the sores and pain sensitivity and possibly the sores being another symptom. I am grateful for any info or help I can get from the community here! God Bless you all!


 Thank you for asking! While my husband had seemed adamant about my parents going in a home, he has now changed, albeit not too dramatically, his more intimate caring of my parents has now left him with a dilemma of his own. He does not think he will do well with putting my parents in a home, and has backed off his stance. Last month my mother's Psychiatrist prescribed meds for sleeping which has helped so much! Next is Dad's visit. While both have been in AD Specialty Hospitals (Mom - 3 times, Dad - once) I don't care for those places either. They seem to take away too much of the patients dignity and are so institutionalized, even so much as looking like a prison. It was very difficult to find a Psychiatrist who would treat geriatric and accept medicare. We are hoping that this doctor will help avoid further hospitalizations in AD hospitals. It seems as if now, it's harder for me. I get so tired and wonder myself how long I can continue with caring for my folks. It's not easy having two AD patients in home, but I am realizing that since April of last year, I have yet to have a break of any sorts and respite is desperately needed! Both my parents are too advanced for any Day Programs, which was a disappointment. Medicare won't pay if they are unable to retain, which sounds crazy when it's for AD patients to begin with. So I am searching for other avenues to give my husband, daughter and I a break. Any ideas are always welcome! I can't find the original thread I posted in; so anyone linking this one to that one would be helpful. Again, thanks for asking and your concern!


 My mother passed away on May 26th, 2014. I haven't been able to do much though. The grieving process is so very difficult right now. I am also executors for both my parents wills and there are some things I need to do with the house before listing for sale. I have also run unto a problem with one of my brothers ... he's crazy. He accused me of killing my mother. He actually called the Sheriff's office and D.A. The Sheriff interviewed me, which was something I could have never dreamed could happen. My younger brother (he's 53) never wanted to know what was happening with my parents. Whenever I called him to give me him news of my parents' illness, he'd get upset and say that knowing what was wrong was making his blood pressure go up and he'd just hang up! I don't know what happened to him. He used to be a good guy. But this person he has become, is a monster! How could any sibling who had a clue about how much love is needed to care with someone with Alzheimer's could think this way, is way beyond my understanding of human nature. My brother has never been able to make it on his own, he's always had financial support from my parents his entire life. I've been just the opposite, having too much pride to ever ask for a dime! I found that managing my life was easier to do alone. I don't care for owing anyone either nor telling anyone if I did have a financial problem. I always managed to make it. I suppose another reason I am dragging my heels is that I don't want problems during the probate of the wills. Plus, right now, I could add up all the money they gave him and give to the courts as a loan and he wouldn't get a dime. Feeling this way, I thought perhaps my own reasoning would be more generous in nature to him if I did wait. I have never wanted to make a decision when angry. And, yes, I am angry. I loved both my parents SO much, it hurts so bad to have this empty void from caring for them and missing them so much. My brother made things worse on me. I hope I can one day forgive him and do what my parents would have wanted me to do."
Getting impatient living with a person suffering from Alzheimer,"First, I would like to say that I am not the most patient human being alive, but I am empathetic and definitely work hard to understand all aspects of a situation before giving up all hope. My boyfriends grandmother suffers from Alzheimers disease and she has been living with us since I moved here for graduate school. Her assisted living home was destroyed by a hurricane and her daughter is currently working out of the country. I have been living with her for 7 months. I would like some feedback and/or advice as to what can/should be done as I am growing impatient and frustrated as time goes on. Here is a short history of the patient: (from what I have been told) She is 89 years old - No one is aware of when the onset of Alzheimers actually began. At the time she lived at her home and her son lived with her on and off but failed to inform family members when she was forgetting food on the stove and burning it etc. he basically ignored warning signs although the patients own mother suffered from Alzheimers and this was approximately 7 years ago. - about 3 years ago my boyfriends mother got news that her mother was driving and getting lost for hours on highways and ending up at all sorts of wrong destinations and she realized something was definitely wrong and was upset that her brother chose to ignore the early signs and seek help. And she was diagnosed with Alzheimers/Dementia. I have never been around any individual suffering from Alzheimers prior to my move and have taken the 7 months battling with trying to learn, understand, be sympathetic yet keep my sanity at the same time. Prior to her living with us I had been around her but there is a huge difference being around her for an hour and living with her. I have questions that some people may be able to answer for me and offer some advice as to the stage of progression she is in and how to cope with it. We have a nursing service that comes in daily to care for her from 9am-5pm when I am normally in school. However, her worst behavior tends to be in the evenings and it took me a few weeks to realize how much it was interfering with my work. Aside from her inability to recognize her grandchildren, her children and anyone for that matter I wasn't prepared for what more was to come. Obviously, I was new to the situation and while I would be sitting at a table doing my work she would repetitively ask questions, ramble about (i dont know what) and/or start ""cleaning"" my papers, books etc. exclaiming at the ""disgusting mess"" on the table. My boyfriend, her nurse would try to tell her to leave me alone but she simply could not remember what she was told one minute to the next. This is when I realized that I am dealing with a pretty bad situation. Most days I am able to either hide from the frustration caring for her often creates but some days it becomes unbearable. Also, I am aware that I may feel more frustrated because I am not directly related to her but I also naively believed in the beginning that I could somehow get through to her. There are moments when she is insanely sweet and easy to get through to however, the times where she is cursing at family members screaming for the police and mumbling about people try to kill her/killing people, I grow increasingly frustrated. I would like to list some of her behaviors and would like to know the experiences of others and whether these are signs of extremely progressed alzheimers: - She cannot recognize any faces, she believes her children are her parents and her grandchildren are strangers etc. she cannot even recognize herself in old photographs. - She will places dirty/old food in her pockets and believes napkins to be money and become combative when we try to take them away from her - She has no idea where the restroom or her bedroom are and has to be lead to them each time she has to go to either - When I try to be nice and take her along for car rides/errands so she can get a change of scenery I become irritated because she is constantly complaining and touching strangers - She is unable to get dressed/undressed alone although she also become combative most evenings when we try to get her layers over layers of clothes on that she puts on throughout the day. - She has an extremely fiesty character and although my boyfriend is extremely laid back I am saddened by the mental and emotional abuse he puts up with when she begins cursing at him and saying horrible things. I have done my fair share of research and she suffers from every single symptom as far as her recollection and behavior go. However two things seem to stand out to me and also sadden me are that a majority of the males in her family have grown increasingly uncomfortable to be around her because she believes them to be her boyfriend and says inappropriate things to them tries to touch them etc. I know she is unaware of the discomfort her behavior creates but I am interested to know if any others have this problem? Lastly, I have noticed in recent weeks that she will LOUDLY whisper gibberish and just repeat herself for a period of time even though i try to distract her and ask if she would like something or if she's ok. I am aware its a result of her unawareness/insecurity/confusion but it's insanely difficult to sit back and listen to. Any advice/similar experiences would help. Sorry for the long detailed post...its been a long time coming :) Thank you.","Hello .......... This may not be of any help, but .... if it was your close Grandmother (known all your life) .... the situation would be even worse. I don't mean to minimize this at all - but maybe your boyfriend needs some evening breaks, as well as, you! Is there a chance that the two of you could find someone (Grandma would trust) to come in two nights a week ... so that the two of you could get out of the house at least one night a week. Call it a date night or whatever. You two need breaks - even if your BF doesn't appear to show it. My Mother just passed about 6-weeks ago, after being in an Assisted Living Home for Dementia for 16-months. Before that, she lived at her own home and had 24/7 caregivers for 15-months. And before and during that timeframe, I called her daily for 16-years and went to her house (40-mile round-trip) for about three years while paying for all of her bills. I did not live with her during those timeframes but so her often and worked closely with any of her help. She was 95 when she passed. From what you've described, it does sound like she's well into this sad disease of dementia or alzheimers. Since going weekly to her Assisted Living Home, I was able to observe my Mother and the others in her home for well over a year. Some have bitter and even violent attitudes ... and some only go there occasionally. My Mother did call the police twice when under care at her home - and accused one of the caregivers of theft to the police. She also three times had episodes over night thinking and screaming that someone was in her house trying to kill her. These things are very traumatic experiences .... to all .... especially an untrained caregiver and/or relative. You two need help in that area. Please tell your BF that the two of you need to get out at least once a week - to have some fun or privacy. More often is even better. One of the most common problems with memory patients is distrust. I think it's one of the first signs. So finding and introducing a caregiver may be a problem ..... unless the one who works days (who grandma knows) can also work two evenings a week - for 3 or 4-hours an evening. Oh yes ..... and bad behavior at night (or after 5pm) is very typical of those memory illnesses. I think if you had two nights a week away from grandma .... maybe one night to study at a library and one night to get out with your BF for some fun - but every week ..... you might get more mileage out of your patience. I think this would help the BF a great deal - even if he isn't showing signs of stress yet. He will - in time. Do something before that happens ... please! Peace and wellness Rob & Gizmo


 You truly need to place her in a facility that accepts Alz pts... You need not apologize or make excuses to anyone... PLEASE do this... I have worked with Alz pts in homes and during the 2nd and 3rd stages, definitely should NOT be cared for in your home unless it is on a 24 hr basis...and even THAT can be difficult... if they escape from your home, they will have NO idea where they are... ALL of your frustrations and feelings are completely understandable... I wish you love and luck! Bettsann


 Consider posting this message on a very active Altzheimer message board which is alzconnected.com.


 Thank you for you reply I appreciate it."
Exercise and preventing dementia,Dr. Mercola has and excellent article on the importance of exercise in preventing Dementia. It is important to keep the blood flowing to the brain to rebuild brain cells. Think this would be beneficial in Alzheimer's and for that matter important in treating all disease. Important to have good blood flow throughout the body., 
Moments of clarity near the end,"My husband was diagnosed with Alzheimers in 2007. He was only 60 when he was diagnosed. He is in late stage now and is on Hospice care. He has been unable to talk or do anything for himself since 2012. And, he hasn't known me for many many months. However, in the past couple of weeks, there seems to be some slight recognition when he sees me. His Hospice worker said that he was more alert and made eye contact when she was with him this week. One of my dear friends, whose husband just died of AD at age 61, told me there are often moments of clarity near the end of life. I read a few posts on this site about loved ones even talking briefly with complete clarity, making sense. What are your experiences. I feel very conflicted. On one hand, I want to be with him all the time in case he does this. On the other hand, I don't want to visit my husband because it breaks my heart for him to have any recognition of me. I have adjusted to him not knowing me and, for some reason, it really bothers me that he is showing any recognition. As usual, Alzheimers is confounding and incredibly sad.","I remember when my husband was in that stage. He would imagine that he saw his father coming into his nursing home. This was not a good thing because his father was very violent and it would send my husband into fear and panic. He did have sundownners when he was in earlier stage Alz. Bless you while you go through this disease!


 My dad is much more clear in mornings than he is late in the day... But he also has Sundowners syndrome. He sees little people in room that watch tv with him and such. I and my sister learned a while back to not bother correcting him when he called us by other peoples names and or didn't know who were are. The really sad part is that in the mornings is when he ""Knows"" he's going downhill and wishes God would just take him home... Late in the day he speaks mostly gibberish..


 I can just imagine how heartbreaking it is when your DH can't recognize you! Hugs to you both! My MIL is in the later stages of dementia, her doctors never bothered to diagnose what was the cause of her dementia. Most of the time, she was able to at least recognize me, though she could not say my name, nor the names of my boys, her only grandchildren. Nowadays, she knows she is confused, but alternately, she says she saw her mother and father and that she is sick and tired of living at the Memory Care Unit, she wants to ""quit"" because she is tired of ""working there"". Lately in the afternoons, she doesnt' speak at all, she just sits in her wheelchair looking for her keys and money. She can do this for hours. It is so hard for DH to watch, he had a stroke this past May due to the stress of taking care of his mother. So I sure hope you have a good support system and are caring for your own health!!! My heart goes out to you both! Take care, Ruth"
I feel as if I lost her many years ago,"I have not been on this forum for quite some time. It appears to be more active now than it was in the past and that is a good thing. I hope members are able to lean on each other and support one another. My mom passed away October 1, 2014. She was diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's 11 years' ago. It has been a very long journey. I feel as if I lost her many years' ago and every time she declined, I lost a little more of her. Her passing was actually a blessing, as horrible as that may sound. She was 92 years' old and was diagnosed with two forms of terminal cancer five months' ago. I am very grateful that she did not go to end stage, she was at the beginning of end stage. She still recognized me and my sisters, although there were times when she did not, but they were momentary. She was sweet and loving until about three days' before she died, and then she didn't want anyone near her, including her daughters. She lived on a special memory care floor of a nursing home. I had hospice come in one week before she died and they were wonderful. I truly believe that being the person she was, so strong willed, she decided when it was time. Everyone was shocked over her death, including the staff and hospice nurse. Yes, she was declining, but no one thought she would go so fast. I believe she made up her mind and within two days she simply got into bed and stayed there. The day she died, she was in a deep sleep throughout the day, a very peaceful sleep, breathing evenly. I had spent the night with her the night before; I had been going every day for weeks. That night, I was right by her side, holding her hand, watching her sleep, listening to her breathe and she just stopped breathing. Of course I miss her and I grieve her and feel a tremendous loss, but I cannot tell you how grateful I am that I was able to be there with her, to see how peaceful she passed. I wish all of you good health and peace. Miriam","Miriam, I'm so sorry about your mom. I understand completely about conflicted feelings at these times. I'm glad that you were with her. You and your sisters gave her a lot of comfort and care as she declined in health and I'm sure she appreciated that and your love. I hope you and the family are doing well.


 Hello Miriam, Just wanted to convey my condolences to you and your family on the passing of your mom. I'm very sorry for you loss... I am glad that you're able to accept it and you were able to be by her side till the end. Keeping you and your family in my thoughts... UA


 I'm so sorry to hear of your loss. I was with my gma too when she passed away. As hard it is to let go, it's sort of a relief to know the person you loved has been eased of any pain and suffering. My sincerest condolences to you and your family."
TOTALLY stubborn Dad who has given up.,"Hello...Let me be blunt and to the point. My Dad will not listen to doctors, he will not listen to my Mom, he will not raise a finger to help himself, and he won't get out of his chair that sits in front of the TV. He walks like a 1000 year old even though he's 83 and he rarely takes a shower (once every few weeks). He's basically become a lazy jerk who cares very little about his doting and worried wife or anyone else! But it's all passive/aggressive. He doesn't yell anymore...he just sits there and watches TV looking (and sometimes smelling) like a bum. I posted once before but I don't really have the time to find the thread and add to it. NO DIAGNOSIS because he hates doctors. No, my Mom doesn't have friends (literally!) to go to for support, only my sister and me. And my sister will be moving out of state next year!! (We both live within 15 minutes of Mom and Dad) Dad is the same. My Mom is beyond tears and this ""new behavior"" of his which all started after a stay in the hospital now over a year ago. She's VERY afraid and is unfamiliar with the role of being ""man of the house"". She's very timid but has on occasion gotten really tough with my Dad. Yes, he forgets things and is lethargic and doesn't give a crap. He wanders when they go to the grocery store. Although a Diabetic, he throws all sorts of sugary sweets into the shopping cart. Prior to the hospital stay he more or less was a ""good"" Diabetic, now he doesn't care. I could go on and on...and the telemarketers have a FIELD DAY with him! Personally, I just need to vent on behalf of my Mom. She is an introvert and doesn't know what to do and quite frankly I don't know what can be done with/for him apart from slapping him across the face and yelling ""Snap out of it!"" Don't get all upset...no one is going to do that. PLEASE...don't be all politely responsive. Although I appreciate anyone's concern, I need a response that, if nothing else, ""mirrors"" our frustrations. To put it lightly, it's hard to help someone who won't help themselves... And my Mom is even more distrusting of doctors than my Dad. So what's a daughter to do besides ""be there"" for them?? HERE'S A BIG QUESTION At what point, do you just let a person, a stubborn adult, give up???? Post Edited (Diane D.) : 9/11/2014 10:11:48 PM (GMT-6)","It's pretty weird watching parents turn into children while we turn into parents. So treat him like a child. NO TV till he takes a shower My dad who weighs about 100 and nothing can be tough to deal with... He thinks he has a lot of important things to say.. We'll get into a meeting of the minds....but I hold my ground till he caves in... Course, he'll forget the whole thing within a matter of hours... But just like any stubborn child, the parent should always win.


 Diane, I think it would also be wise for your mom (and you) to make an appointment with your dad's doctor without your dad and explain what's going on. There might be other health issues here. Ask the doctor if there are any social services in your city that can help your mom deal with your dad's behavior. He may qualify for some home care of some form. Good luck!


 Force your dad dude to. Go to the hospital who cares if he is being really annoying and ignorant deep down we all know he wants to be alive so just push him to do stuff


 Hi Diane - I agree with JaSanne - the depression and heart attacks. You want replies that r blunt so here it goes: My dad has Alzheimer's and it sucks. He too is passive aggressive. I'm his primary support person so I have some understanding. His entire personality has changed and now he is an angry belligerent at times nasty man. 1. Alzheimer's is a brain disease. It is not your dad anymore. He knows not what he does. Please don't blame him for his behavior because he no longer has the ability to manage it. 2. Your mom and you need to get to an Alzheimer's support group. 3. My dad will be 83 next month - chances are your dad was in the service during the Korean War so he qualifies for VA, as does your mother. (He didn't have to be in Korea) all medical expenses are covered and income and assets aren't limited, except they can't own 2 homes. 4. VA will cover in home care including a social worker, PT, OT - I know your dad refuses but once someone is there it could work. 5. Why do I say this? That person was right - HE is like a Child. Don't yell, don't engage in un-winnable fights, don't plead. Be firm, don't ask but tell him what he needs to do, also redirect or change the subject. Let him watch TV if it calms him. Chances are high that he can't remember anything he's done, like if he ate breakfast, or took a shower, etc. he may not remember HOW to do these things anymore and either is too ashamed to ask or - like a toddler, doesn't know that he's supposed to even shower any more. That's part of Alzheimer's and why people need in home or nursing home care. 6. MOST IMPORTANT::: he's afraid, he's scared and confused and THIS ISNT HIS FAULT. but as a MAN he can't admit his fears. It's the way men were socialized. The highest suicide rate is among elderly men who no longer find a purpose to their lives. 7. There's adult day care (pd by VA), drs who make home visits, in home care, respite care (your mom needs that!). 8. You are a good supportive daughter and your father is fortunate to have you in his life!!!

 This is so frustrating. It's difficult to explain my parents to strangers, I also have to take into account that there is a small chance that my mom will get on HealingWell and read this and totally freak out. Sigh. (she's very sensitive) Oh well... I presented the idea of taking away the remote and at first she agreed that it was a good idea but now she's afraid he's going to get mad at her and says that won't work. Sigh...She said she marks it on the calendar when he showers so she can show him. I said but mom, if there's no consequence to NOT doing it why would he do it at all??? All that does is give her something to talk about when she calls me and my sister on the phone to lament about dad. ""Well, (she says when she calls me) it's been over a month now since dad has showered...he's just so stubborn!"" He still has ALL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL POWER over her which, in her mind, TRUMPS any power she has. Every idea I present she quietly finds an excuse why it wouldn't work because my dad would just get mad. She has been treated like a CHILD for so long and now my dad has become the CHILD and she is like a fish out of water! TOTALLY unequipped to take on the new role. Like I said, they don't really go to doctors so there's NO DIAGNOSIS, NO MEDICATIONS, NO PROFESSIONAL INPUT other than what my mom has read on the internet. I told my mom I'd go with her and dad and I could TALK TO THE DOCTOR since my mom says that she is too intimidated by doctors. She shrugged her shoulders and didn't comment... BTW My dad was in the hospital for Shingles and he fell out of his chair (TV chair) and couldn't get up. That's all I can get ""out of my mom"". In the hospital he was on all sorts of meds which my mom blames for everything. But that was a year ago! I point out the symptoms of Alz and Depression she says he's not THAT bad so it can't be...ROUND AND ROUND WE GO. In the meantime, my mom gets HORRIBLE STOMACH PAINS from all the stress or it could be from the GRAPEFRUIT SIZED HERNIA she has had for 25 years! Again, she won't go to the doctor...Now I'm getting all stirred up!! See what I (and my siblings) have to deal with! This is the fun part of dysFUNctional? If this were funny we could start a SITCOM REALITY SHOW!! So when do I need to start being the BAD GUY instead of the helpful daughter? Post Edited (Diane D.) : 9/24/2014 12:07:19 PM (GMT-6)


 Thank you, I'll order that book right now. I'll have it delivered to my house and then take it over to her. She'd be afraid of my dad seeing it and getting upset. She can keep it in her bedroom. An Alz support group, it's not going to happen with my mom. She's very self-conscience. I hesitate to compare them to Ma and Pa Kettle because Ma and Pa were more social. I WOULD BE VERY VERY HAPPY if I could just get my dad to see a doctor. That would be a HUGE HUGE miracle for them! Hopefully my dad would ""behave"" himself and my mom wouldn't be too much of a nervous wreck. Those things that other people consider a ""normal"" series of events, a normal response, are not in my parents vocabulary/train of thought. They're hard to describe...but they're functional to the outside world. My dad is totally normal when he talks to his sister on the phone. Go figure!


 What you're probably going to have to do is make an appointment yourself (hopefully with another of your siblings) and drag him to the doctor. I've had to do it; it's not easy, but it sounds like it has to be done. Sometimes you just have to be crafty (a nicer way to say it than just saying you have to lie) and come up with something like, ""oh I called you doctor's and found out it's way past that follow-up checkup you were supposed to have so I made the appointment myself, and don't worry, I'm going with you!"" He probably actually was supposed to have a follow-up. I live in a rural area of the US; a lot of people I know/grew up around WERE Ma and Pa Kettle! Actually, your descript ion of your parents' situation is a very common one in the elderly. Keep in mind that elderly people who are seeing their abilities to care for themselves slipping away are frightened. It can trigger depression and all sorts of things (aside from the strong possibility of your father having dementia). I spent a LOT of sleepless nights wondering what I was going to do about my parents' situation. There was one point that my mother went months w/o bathing and when I finally pressed as to why, my father admitted that (at this point he had been helping her in and out of the tub) they both nearly fell when he tried to get her out and was afraid. I felt terrible. I took over, with his help, and started bathing her myself. But my mother was tiny by that time, well under 100lb. That's was not the case with my father when he finally went down. Your mother sounds like she is past the point of taking over in the manner you want her to. I'm sure she's frightened of the future, but she's probably not going to be able to change the dynamic of her relationship with your father at this point. She's in need of help just as much as your father. Eventually you and your siblings are going to have to have a meeting and decide how to go about doing what's best for them. It's not going to go away.


 You never let a adult give up you must keep them going because they have so much more life to live. And anyway I know someone like that I just gave up. On them and they died I tryed to keep him up on his feet but he just gave up and died if you love him keep him up in is feet I know he might be a pain in the ass but you must keep him going


 That's a GREAT motto, if he's going to act like a child and demand to be taken care of like a child... I'll try to encourage my mom to ""be a mom to him"". She's just so hesitant to step up because HE'S been the boss, HE'S BEEN THE DAD AND SHE THE CHILD for their entire 57 year marriage. HE did everything and made all the decisions etc and she went along with it like a good Christian wife. She also took all the insults and humiliation in public that he handed out to her agreeing with him that she must have done something wrong and apologizing (taking the fall) in order to keep the peace. Quite frankly it bordered on disgusting how ""defeated"" she became all in the name of ""keeping the peace"". But now he rarely yells (strange for him) he just sits and watches TV while sitting and sitting and sitting all day long. He's SO feeble and weak now. But yes, I agree, he needs to be thought of as a ""child"". BRILLIANT train of thought!! Mom needs to be a loving but strict mom. Love him but patiently be the MOM that his behavior demands. I've told her so many times ""Mom, you can ""run"" faster than him now LOL..all you have to do is stay out of his ""reach"". NOT that he'd hit her, but you know what I mean. It's about time she take advantage of the situation (for his good) HE has put himself in. She's got to turn the tables, which in this case the ""table"" is NOT a the heavy Mahogany BANQUET table that she been living with for so long, but merely a flimsy ol' cardboard box due to his physical condition. OH PLEASE PRAY that she'll go outside her ""comfort zone"" and step up to the task. It would go against the grain of the wife she's been for SO LONG. And yet, Steve and others, this is such a SIMPLE concept and to anyone else would be an easy solution. I just hope she's DESPERATE ENOUGH, she seems to be, to consistently TAKE A STAND AND BE A MOM. LOL leave it to a man to be blunt and to the point. THANK YOU STEVE. DO OTHER PEOPLE AGREE WITH THIS????????????


 She doesn't trust doctors and the only ""doctor"" he has recently seen are the one's he saw in the hospital that he came home from all screwed up. He refused to do what they told him upon follow-up visits. He's just a totally stubborn, dig his heals into the ground, adult-child. Neither one are ""social"" people that would seek traditional help that normal people take for granted. They're quite the pair! LOL. I've contacted the hospital about getting transcript s from my dad's hospital stay. ALL THE TROUBLE started when he came home. Not that there wasn't trouble before, LOL! She doesn't have the ""privacy"" from dad for me to send her e-mails about this or for her to read forums. (long story) I think I'm just going to encourage my mom to be THE MOM to my dad and take on that role as opposed to the ""servant"" role that he expects her to take. I think that's a good plan for now. I just hope she's up to it emotionally. Sigh...life is fun, ain't it.


 You haven't stated why he was hospitalized in this post (or I've missed it). When my mother had ""missed"" heart attacks, her personality changed like this, even in her early 60's. Even the doctors, who didn't have sense enough to know she was having heart attacks, thought she was nuts, but she was in a deep depression caused by the physiological changes. She later had a heart attack in the hospital and the evidence was there from past attacks. Eventually she developed Parkinson's and I and my dad started bathing her and feeding her. To a point, it may seem like he can help it, but whatever the cause, it's not as simple as that. Depression or illness, especially at his age, can just shut down their ability to cope and they become what appears to others as stubborn and unwilling to try when, in fact, they are just frozen to do anything. Regardless, your mother needs outside help or she's going to go down with him and fast. There are Home Health programs where someone can come into the home and bathe him. My sister and I had to become advocates for both our parents eventually. We took them to their doctors and told what was going on, and eventually had to become their guardians. You do become their parent to a degree, but there's a way to do it without taking away their dignity and still showing respect.


 No time right now for an adequate response to 2 great replies. Later. But I had to say THANK YOU THANK YOU to both of you. More later...


 Hi Diane: I hear your frustration. I have felt it myself. Hmmm... It sounds like you told your mom that your dad DOES NOT have all the psychological power. He is very very ill with a brain disease. I would recommend you keep using that terminology. Does she honestly believe your father would go 30 days without showering on purpose? To anger your mother? I don't know your father, you or your mother. If he has done this a young husband than I will readily admit I'm WRONG. But what u r describing reminds me of my readings about classic dementia /Alzheimer's symptoms. Chances are good He does not have the cognitive ability to remember to shower or even know how to shower anymore. Just like a person with ALS can't move their limbs even though they want to? He can no longer function. Maybe using metaphors can help your mother? It sounds like she is terrified - your father (wether she liked it or not) took care of everything and now it's getting tossed in her lap. Maybe it's easier for your mom to deny everything and blame Dad, then admit she feels helpless? A very helpful book is ""the 36 hour day"". It is an excellent resource and informative book on just what you are describing in your email. Your mom may feel validation reading that book, that she's not alone and others are going thru exactly what she is... Maybe this will prompt her/encourage her to try an Alzheimer's support group. That is something you and siblings can do together with your mom. And she may need to see a dr for an antidepressant or low dose anti anxiety medication. Right now maybe the best thing you can do is validate your moms frustration, and ignore her counting days etc- to not reinforce that belief system that he's got all this power. The scary thing is he's actually powerless, and that too can be frightening to your mom, and your family, not to mention how confused and terrified your dad must feel. I imagine that your dad has NO CONTROL over his behavior, because of his brain disease. Either does your mom - over your dad's behavior... I guess that's my point... And it's you, poor you and your mother and family, WHO SUFFER, as your Dad, in lucid moments, is so frightened and also suffers. If you can, I really recommend you buy or rent from the library, the book I mentioned earlier in the post - ""the 36 hour day"". It's really informative, easy to read, and has an index so you only need to read what pertains to your situation. Although you may find help in all the sections - I did. Good luck and I look forward to hearing your progress! Btw - my father didn't even remember it was my 50th birthday yesterday, and I know he'd be horrified if I told him he forgot. So I won't say a word. It's okay, he's not my dad anymore, but it still hurts. Jfer


 I ordered 2 books, one for me and one large print for my mom. Thank you."
Ritalin for brain stimulation,Anyone taking Ritalin to think better and talk or is given to a loved one that is working well?,"Sorry I wasn't too clear with this. My mom has Parkinsons with dementia. I read articles where studies have been done on elderly people taking Ritalin for apathy and to wake up. While it calms the nerves in ADHD folks it does the opposite to old people. My mom is super sensitive with medication so I was only thinking of giving her the lowest dose of 5mg and only once a day. I tried Amantadine on her last month and it worked but.. her balance was off so I had to stop it. Of course I need to show the articles to her doctor to see if he will let her try it. Thanks for writing. I hardly ever get responses on this website. It's a shame.


 Thanks for the link. That's the one I saw along with others. I have asked her doctors for it before and both of them in the past said no because like you said it's speed and may cause heart attacks. However I'm still thinking of in terms of the smallest dose per day. My mom's brain is so slow that perhaps in her case it will benefit and not suffer any of side effects you mentioned because it's so little taken. Amantadine liquid is to be taken 10mg twice a day. I was only giving my mom 5mg a day and it was good enough to make her stay awake. Unfortunately I found out it is not to be taken with Namenda which my mom takes so I had to stop it. I have a friend's son that takes it and she said it's a wonderful drug. I know everything is case by case so unless it's tried I'll never know. Standard PD drugs is not working right for my mom and she's already at her limit because the dykinesia has caused her to lose 13 teeth in the course of the year. Marijuana is ""bad"" and make people high but taken by the right reasons it works wonders. Right?


 I see what you're saying but I'm not giving up. There has to be something more I can do other than let it be. Only when you give up then it is done. Thanks. I'll see what the doctor says. I think like any drugs not all will cure everyone so perhaps that's why it's never put on the must list for PD. There's always provigil as my 2nd choice. Any thoughts on that? My goal is to make my mom stay awake more. Right now she's only awake like 3 hours at most and that's spread out time. Everything shuts down when you sleep and that's her problem. When she was on Amantadine she was awake and talking more than now. If only it didn't interfere with her mobility other wise she would still be on it now. So are you on Ritalin still?


 My mom has no interest in anything. Well.. I take that back. She likes to flip the comforter up and down but that only lasts about 3 minutes and then she has to sit down due to a fractured lower back. I take her for walks but that lasts 10 minutes and then she's exhausted. She drinks lipton tea every morning with her oatmeal but that does nothing for her. She was a heavy coffee drinker before so caffeine doesn't do much for her since her body is used to it. I thought getting her the Wii game when it was popular but her brain is too slow to follow. Once she played pinball on my computer but that was with me holding her hands down and pushing the buttons for her. When she was well she was an avid slot machine player. She LOVED it but once the machines stopped shooting out coins she lost interest. She likes the sound it makes and seeing the reward of her labor. Sometimes technology just sucks! If I got her animal then I have to take care of that too. She was never into them anyways. She gave away my 5 cats when I was small. They came to me as strays and I loved them dearly. I have tried everything but her lack of focus and interest is my enemy. You are smart to keep yourself busy and stimulated. That's the key.


 My mom's problem is more with her dementia then Parkinsons. Thanks so much for listening. Take care too.


 Me too. haha I'm alone and never married. Not looking forward to old age.


 Only if I win the lottery. :)


 Bella, Have u had a diagnosis for ADD/ADHD? It slows down the thinking process... http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/news/20031204/brain-scans-reveal-adhd-differences ADHD runs in our family. I have taken Ritalin off & on. Only to focus on one or two things at a time. Otherwise most ADHD CHARACTERISTICS CAN RUN ME RAGGAD. Never finishing anything constantly distracted by association. It helps me focus better and I had zero accidents. (Sprains vs breaks.)It helped me to slow down and a lot less daily frustration,aggravation. See cat scan online of an ADHD brain vs a normal brain. Neurons jump around in the brain scatter around rather than thinking thru in a chain like a step latter sequence normal brain thinking analogy. Hyper is not all negative as we get a bad wrap... I am ADHD & proud of it... It has it's pay offs. Taking meds for better focus depends on the diagnosis. The past few years I have landscaped 3 acres from nothing into a beautiful woodland garden. We do yearly tours of the garden, raising money for scholarships for horticulture graduates from HS. ADHD has been a learning curve for a better focus with coping skills. It has it ups & downs just a different thought process. There are time released Ritalin capsules easier when it wears off every day for sleep. It feels really awful....also addictive. It can cause sleep issues if taken to late in the day. Anyone Truly DIAGNOSED with ADHD can actually slow down the thinking process with meds.... Less hyper or daydreaming . If it does not slow u down u maybe should try something else. Important to follow the drs. advice with any medication . Also there are other meds to help focus on tasks. ie: Adderall also time released. It won't hurt to try if u don't like it, U have a choice of other meds or not take any meds. Do some research. If u have other questions don't be a stranger. I am here for u. More INFO on Ritalin. http://www.diffen.com/difference/Adderall_vs_Ritalin


 Bella, Sorry I know what ya mean my topics are rarely answered. It's better to enter a thread on the discussion or close to it. Or ask a moderator. Ok got a better picture . Explains the question stimulation to the brain. It also stimulates other organs while on these drugs they make me feel shaky & my heart races when they wear off. Also again when the drug wears off I am starved because they are also appetite suppressants. Any stimulant given to anyone without ADHD BRAIN DISFUNCTION the neurons are not hitting the proper pathways in the brain a broken link in the pattern of thinking. Meaning they are scattered throughout the brain. PLZ see link on CAT scans normal brain vs ADHD. This will help u understand. http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/news/20031204/brain-scans-reveal-adhd-differences Ritalin speeds up the neurons in the brain in order to link them together thru the entire thought process to think thru one task at a time. No matter what the age young or old Ritalin will speed them up if not ADHD,mentally( making her mentally more sped up /confused not normal..) & physically. On the street Ritalin & other drugs in the same class are called speed. Sold on the black market for a ""high"". It is considered a mind altering drug. That is the effect of speed/Ritalin those without ADHD. Those with ADHD Ritalin slows us down. Thinking stops racing and a train of thought can be completed without constant interruption. Remember these drugs are addicting and the Body builds up a resistance requiring higher doses . Research on the science and studies May help. It is hard for me to imagine. I'm resistant to this medication for Parkinson's it is for two different brain disorders. I would never consider giving my mom speed . Only because I take it & know the side effects. See study link below for Parkinson's disease Ritalin effects. Studies I would sincerely questions in this case . However with the side effects vs the helpful effects it wouldn't hurt to try, keep in mind the mental stress and stress effects on the body. Shakiness & intense hunger, heart palpitations every day when the drug wears off as well as addiction. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/05/040507082157.htm My best guess would be that the dr would have to weigh the benefits with the side effects for Parkinson's Hope this gives u insight and can help u make a informed decision & with the judgement of the dr.


 Bella, The effects of Ritalin at the lowest level could be a factor to give clear thinking in ur moms case or keep her awake, or do both ...during the day . Again in a brain with ADHD THAT IS THE CASE... In the elderly not necessarily the case. Neurons in ADHD & Parkinson's in the brain have 2 entirely different disorders of the brain. It is a help with children with ADHD... THEY STILL SUFFER THE SIDE EFFECTS. Addiction later in life also a inclination to be addicted to other drugs according to many studies. In children with severe ADHD....counseling , structure at all times, special classes in school, often the child is above average in intelligence however other learning disabilities and character disorders are involved. And medication. These 3 carefully orchestrated & monitored at all times.. The trinity of ADHD treatment works well. However many fall thru the cracks... How are u going to include that treatment for UR mother. Behavioral studies are difficult to access in any case, let alone those with Parkinson's. There are developmental studies proven for over 50 years that Ritalin helps children with ADHD. Yet the down side to that study... & there are down sides to every study, show 82% of this countries prisoners are ADHD. That to me is a oxymoron, when today's treatment for ADHD is a standard yet a total failure in 82% of those in prisons across the country. The thought process needs to be nurtured, it cannot emerge by itself while on Ritalin or any mind altering drugs. Otherwise tics develop, suppression of emotional feelings can be the effect of non traditional treatments for behaviors UR trying to fix. It can only be fixed to a certain degree..is putting anyone on a drug that essentially speeds up the whole mind .. body as other factors come into play that we have no control over... Again u and UR mothers dr. must realize the brain chemistry with Adderal, Ritalin & Amentadine, all have the SAME EFFECT ...TO speed up the brain to force neurons in the brain to connect in a secular fashion to complete a thought process in a non-diseased brain. ADHD is not a disease. Bella even as much as u want UR mother to be better this ADHD medication is not the way to go. Ritalin has been around since the late 60's . If so why has it not been included in the normal treatments for Parkinson's. Again 5 mg of Ritalin may or may not help,it's only a decision u & UR dr can make.... I understand UR desperation to help UR mom. I went thru a similar struggle with dementia & my mom had ADHD. RITALIN was not even considered for her, to many health issues put her at serious risk. Remember this is a drug that the body becomes resistant with each dose and the dose must be increased accordingly. A start at 5 mg. will evolve into a 25mg to a higher dose witch most certainly would cause increased side effects. Children & adults who take ritalin for ADHD vs Parkinson's patients have 2 entirely different brain disorders. Deterioration of the brain vs neurons that have gone wild frantically racing thru the brain in a connective unruly fashion awake and hustling around like a pinball machine to make connections faster & faster. Ritalin slows this function down in true ADHD BRAINS. It helps to think ahead to plan a thought out before just randomly blurt out anything in a uncontrolled dysfunctional out of control exhibit thru distraction in our own brain from the original subject in the thought process in the first place.U can tame the neurons to a certain degree. Classic success in real life for ADHD seems out of reach thru many drug treatments. I am with UR doc on this. My mom passed yet I knew that there was very little I could do to improve her life other than keep her comfortable & accept the circumstances of her illness. Believe me I tried everything I could. I did not want to loose my mom I was very young. I wish I had better news from my personal experience . My son, mom & myself have ADHD. It is hereditary in my family traced back to great grand parents. There is never a clear cut solution to treatments for most diseases I hope u have a better understanding .. Any questions on Ritalin treatment should be done with the supervision of a doc. He flip side his could cause the Parkinson's to worsen. Perhaps finding a support group for urself with others sharing the same disease will help give u some peace. I wish u the best in the struggles ahead..may The Lord be with on this journey. Many hugs & blessings sent UR way. Peace, Luv, & Laughter


 Have u thought about treating UR mom to teas.. Flavored? They have a lot of caffeine yet they too can make the heart race IF to much. Amount given will be a fine line just like any other meds. Or Caffeine drinks. Ask the doc. I totally understand UR goal. Is that in her best interest to stay awake more? Perhaps doing exercise or structuring her time to interactive time with her will stimulate & train the brain in a more positive direction. Getting her a cat... Any pet? Bird. Those are the things that add comfort and entertainment...focus... Perhaps a friend with a dog or cat . U can contact a hospital that uses pets for the elderly & hook u up. I did that for years.. They wake up and stay interactive longer with a pet. Play time etc. No I cannot take any drug that speeds up my heart rate. I am in my late 60's. I do however have control over my movements ... With Many types of arthritis and hip joint replacements & FM. So I have no choice but to physically slow down. I can honestly say that I understand my disabilities mentally and physically. I do take anti depressants which I have had as a life long issue with ADHD. HEY Einstein had ADHD! I have no experience with Provigil. I will look it up. If a stimulant of any type not a solution. Activity is a good positive solution for her....keep her interacting with various structured activities. It's tricky but as u say don't give up on finding activities that work for her needs. Worked very well for my mom with dementia she had a noisy little chihuahua. Yikes my least fav dog and I am the biggest dog lover ever. That was her choice and she helped take care of her pet. Wake her up in time to feed her pup etc. then it's not u doin the chore it's the dog. A Whole different driving mechanism. Interaction with her is good for u both! Plz check w/ur local hospital into cognitive behavioral therapists for her, that is another direction to help ur mom.


 Bella, I don't know what else to offer in this case. I am very limited in my experience with PD . This can take a toll on u. I hope UR taking care of yourself. I wish u well in UR search for helping ur mom. I gave u my best on this subject. There is never a clear cut solution in these situations. PLZ keep me posted if u have success with any further treatments. Peace, Luv & Laughter


 Bella, Thanku for listening. I hope u can get UR mom's meds sorted out. You are very much a devoted kind loving daughter. I should be so lucky when I need someone down the line. Bless u & UR mom. Peace, Luv & Laughter


 Good attitude. Hope u can enjoy life now and into the twilight years.


 If ya do u know where to find me !"
Sister 67 has Dementia...it is really hard on her/and me,"Hi, I Moderate in Hepatitis, but have been lurking here for some time. And I am working through a tough time. I live 5 miles from my baby sister, 67, who has been diagnosed with complicated grief/depression and cognitive dysfunction and lives alone. As I read the stages of dementia posted on this site, she is a 2... She does her own personal grooming and she is good company once she IS somewhere, but she is deficient in so many ways. She can write a check, but doesn't know if she paid the same bill 3 times. She writes the checks down but not the deposits so she never knows if she has any money. She cannot use an ATM machine any more, can't put gas in her car at a pump as she can't work the machine and watches 1 TV station that she turns on AT the TV. Good thing she like the History Channel. She can make calls on a cell phone and check text messages, but cannot use the GPS in her nice car, and can't do any banking on line. She drives, but gets lost of she goes more than a mile or two from her home. So, I meet her and either drive with her to tell her the directions or drive her. WE are on the cusp of not letting her drive, but she will go kicking and screaming to that decision. If she needs to be somewhere I call her that morning, then she calls me 3 or 4 times back to be sure she has the directions right and then it is a toss up if she will remember to do it. I can be on a street corner and she'll stand me up as often as not or come an hour early and be all upset at me for being ""late."" She is about 75% compliant on her meds....5 psych meds, a statin, 2 bp, thyroid, and incontinence pill. Lots of meds. If she doesn't take the psych meds she is like a zombie. With the meds she is pretty good. Mostly. She enjoys movies but can't tell you the next day what we saw. Her psychologist says to still take her for the socialization if she is enjoying the moment. She plays golf but can't recall where her ball goes or how many stokes she took. She playes with a friend who helps her with those issues. She likes to go out to dinner and I take her about 1 or 2 times a week because I know she is not eating right at home....yogurt, iced tea, balogna sandwiches and cookies. Never anything cooked at all. I've worked bit by bit so that all her stuff is in joint accounts with me. Her house is in a joint account with my daughter (sis has no hubby or kids of her own). She has a will, beneficiaries on stuff, funeral plans, health directives,and I have her power of attorney. So everything is organized for the worst case scenario. But we are struggling. What she wants and what I want are 2 different things. She wants to do whatever she wants and when it goes awry then wants me to fix it....so stuff gets turned off for non payment, things break, the meds get messed up when she doesn't refill them, and she spends money on crazy stuff. Last spring she bought a ticket for a $16,000 cruise! She can't find Olive Garden, which is 1 mile away. How can she meet a tour group in Buenos Aries by herself? Well, the outfitter gave us her money back. Thank goodness. I want to set things up automatically. I want to do her checkboook.. and I want to organize her meds and deliver them once a week in the box. So we are at a crossroads. I had been able to talk her into doing what I thought was right for a long time. Now she has her skids on. Not exactly ugly. She says things like ....""over my dead body"" or ""no way is that going to happen."" So I sort of do like the other caregivers and sulk off exasperated. So I think I am going to do it another way. I am going to figure out the changes that need to be made and just do them. I have changed most of her bills to auto payment from her main account and put money into another account where the bank it really close to her home. She can cash checks right there for cash as she can't do the ATM thing. And she can write a check to the cleaning lady and guy who does her pool. But the taxes and utilities, and insurance will be auto paid so that the DO get paid. And she will have to deal with it. She will hate this change. I see advice here to just do what needs to be done. And I think I have felt empowered by that. Being caregiver is rough. And this is such a sad disease. My sister was vibrant, funny, a professional with a good career, has traveled all over the world several times and can't find the mall. She was a saver and SHOULD be going on cruises. Once her life partner died, it was like she shrank into this helpless person. This is so very very sad. Thanks for listening. Mama Lama from Hep.","Steve...Good thought....though I have the bank sending me a balance every day, so I can track as a cosigner on the account. And the credit card...I have the password and track almost daily. She did something last year before I got a handle on this and bought a $47,000 SUV while I was away for a weekend. She was complaining to a friend that I was mean and wouldn't let her buy a new car and so the ""friend"" said mean things about me and took her to the car dealer. Grrr. When I calmed down, she said I could have the car when she couldn't drive any more...so I'll sell it then I guess, use the money for care. She can afford a car I guess...but she could transport a soccer team in that thing she bought! But I keep worrying that since I'm older I could NOT be available to go over there every day. I'm sorry about your dad. This is a tough situation for anyone. ML


 I'm sure most of the people posting in this section can relate to most of what you're going through. The one thing that stuck out the most to me....You should try to get more control over her bank account. The last thing you want to do is having to dig deep into your own pocket. Maybe you can setup some alert s on her bank account so that you'll be notified in case she spends large amounts. I'll never forget the time my dad ran out of gasoline. He wanted to call the police... He had a receipt in his pocket for the gas and his lottery ticket... It took us forever to get him to calm down AND understand he was going to a SELF SERVE... No one stole his gas...he just didn't pump it."
Has anyone tried Coconut oil for Alzheimer's disease?,"Hello everyone, I'm Usher from the Crohn's disease forum. You might be wondering what I'm doing here. Let me tell you briefly about Crohn's disease. It's an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). My symptoms were severe intestinal bleeding, constipation, anemia, anal fissures, fatigue, depression, anxiety etc. to name a few. I've had memory loss, mental confusion etc. as well. After having read the benefits of coconut oil, I gave it a try. I've consumed probably 500 ml in over 2 weeks now and my brain works far better. I reaped the benefits only after consuming raw coconut oil. I had been eating coconut bread, which unfortunately have not made any difference. Excellent results have been observed for Alzheimers with 20g for 45 - 90 days. The medium chain triglycerides in coconut oil have been found to boost brain health. http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/how-coconut-oil-may-rescue-brain-alzheimers-disease Coconut oil has succeeded where two FDA approved drugs for Alzheimers have failed! http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/new-alzheimers-drugs-continue-to-fail-where-coconut-oil-shines/ Has anyone else tried it with good results?",Here is a recent thread on the subject: www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=8&m=3147379
MIL in last stages of Alzheimer’s,"I've been taking care of my MIL for almost a month now. She, I think, is pretty much in the last stages of Alzheimers. The hardest part for me is watching the ""nothingness"" of her days. She gets up in the morning and has ""one"" cup of coffee as she begins to work her ""word search"" puzzles. And, she works them all day long. She shuffles the pages and checks the answers and a lot of the time she doesn't seem to even be aware of anything around her. It is so hard watching this day after day. I wonder to myself how it must feel to have ""nothing to do"" or to not have anything meaningful to think about . At times she becomes sad about the situation she has found herself in and begins to cry, but most of the time she just sits and works her puzzles. I have tried other activities but she just doesn't seem interested in them. I do walk with her outside for short distances when the weather permits and I have bought several DVD's that I thought she might enjoy watching. So far, The Walton's seem to be the only show she will consistently pay attention to in the evenings. Other times when the TV is on she will work her puzzles or ""pick"" her finger nail cuticles. She just seems to be so ""unaware"" of those around her. Today I was wrapping Christmas gifts and again tried turning the Christmas music very loud to see if she would stop her puzzle working and listen to the music. It didn't work. What is in her head? What is she thinking about ? I don't know how to make her days more meaningful. I don't really know if this is a desire I want for her or for me. It is just so hard watching her do ""nothing"" all day, go to bed at 9:00 PM and get up start the ""nothing"" all over again. Any suggestions anyone???? Susie","Thanks Steve for the advice. Sorry your dad is so difficult at times. I do remember when my dad would do things that were dangerous before he got worse and couldn't speak or eat. He was upset because he thought the newspaper carrier was charging him too much. He called the newspaper office and was very ugly to them. I had to call them and explain. He was being charged for two separate newspapers from two separate companies. He was upset with his son and grandson that was living in the house and many times I had to go over there and try to ""reason"" with him.


 Be happy that she appears to be happy. My dad can be fairly decent the first part of the day then he goes blank and or gets mean and nasty...won't take his meds and can't be reasoned with. He's still determined to find a job which is fine and keeps him busy. But then he'll want one of us to call the employer on his behalf. Few weeks ago he asked me to gather price info for getting a motor scooter so he can't get around town better... He didn't understand the part when I said that as soon as he can't start finding the toilet in his room by himself then we'd talk about a scooter. So just agree with your MIL when you can and let her do her thing.


 Oh ya...the crazy things they do. My dad ran out of gas and wanted to call the police cause he thought he was ripped off. He still had the receipt and lottery tickets in his pocket. Took us forever to convince him it was a SELF Service gas station and what a self service station is. I had mentioned in another thread about how our parents turn into children and we become their parents... So looking and treating them like you would a child can be useful."
Assisted living home for dementia,That's a tricky question and only you know what's best for YOU. it's never easy to be there for someone that caused mental anguish over the years. I really can empathize but unfortunately I'm still trying to sort out my feelings about my father. Maybe someone will come along to offer better advice. Hang in there.,"To SmurfyShadow ... Thanks for all of the thought and explanations. I did call my Mothers Assisted Living Home yesterday just to verify a few things - and I was pretty comfortable with how the Social Director handled my questions and a few of my concerns. My Mother had made a few statements about how the patients went out with the caregivers for various things. I did know that in good weather, there were supervised trips to various places - up to 12-wheelchairs would fit on the small bus they have, and at least 3 care-givers would be on a trip typically. As I had suspected, the trips my Mother was talking about were all made up in her head (out to dinner - or for clothes shopping for example). Mom keeps asking me for money (for those trips) ... and I did want to make sure there wasn't theft going on there - or that one of the caregivers was not going out to pick-up lottery tickets (a long-term bad habit of Mom was in small time gambling). I keep telling her that I cannot give her money. Everything is billed - and I pay that bill once a month. I did give her inexpensive jewelry 3 or 4 times this year - and it all seems to be gone. Last Saturday, I wanted to bring home her two winter-type of coats ... one of them (the cheap one) was there but the 3/4 length leather coat had disappeared. She could easily have given away the cheap jewelry - knowing her ... but never would she give away that coat - never!!! I also called a psycologist yesterday to make an appointment, one I have used twice before last year. He works very well with the terminally ill and with depression. Since I started my third type of chemotherapy two weeks ago, my Oncologist keeps asking me if I have talked to that doctor yet. The combination of the Lupron (hormone therapy) that I've been on for two years now and the three types of chemotherapy along with the Predisone I have been on for about two years now - all combine to create side-effects that, at times, can be hard to manage. Getting tired very easily and high emotions both go with the territory - so does trying to sell my Mothers house or getting it ready for a closing actually in less than 3-weeks. I do need to guard developing feelings of guilt. Creating guilt in me was a specialty of Mom's even from my childhood ... so that cannot be blamed on her dimentia. Saturday, she remembered that very well!!! For nearly 10-months in the Assisted Living Home for Dimentia, she was almost an angel ... well ... nasty words for others but not for me. I guess that's why my last visit with her was so difficult - when she struck out at me - and it seemed to be when I held firm on not giving her spending money. Thanks for listening ... it really helps to be able to just spill it out sometimes!


 What to do? For your mother, you take care of her to the best of your ability. It sounds like you're doing very well on that score. You may want to find someone else, perhaps a friend of hers, who can take over from you if you're no longer able to handle it. For yourself, you take care of the cancer and COPD, you make sure that you schedule enough time for rest and recreation, if possible you forgive your mother (notice that this is for your sake, not hers), and you grieve for everything you have lost and are losing. You get the support you need wherever you can find it. This place is a good start on that. And remember, dementia is much harder on the loved ones, like you, than on the patient herself. When it's survivable, like the benign brain tumor I had removed last year, it can be hell on the patient -- I lost a decade of my life before it was diagnosed and removed; for some reason the only memories I retain of that time are the bad ones -- but a progressive, terminal dementia like Alzheimer's is much less painful for the patient than you might think, especially after she's forgotten her diagnosis. The time will come when your visits, or those of anyone else, are happy surprise visits from a total stranger. Best wishes, Minette


 When my Dad was dying of liver cancer 17 years ago, I was one of his primary caretakers, and got into a local (well, across town) support group that met once a week. They were very helpful. We all had pretty much the same problems and issues, and when one person couldn't figure something out someone else could. Losing him still hurt terribly, but I was able to get through it and past it largely because of that support group. Minette


 Thank you. You are, indeed, the first to welcome me. I'm honored. Minette


 The end of an era is near ........ It's always unavoidable - sooner or later - but the question is: how are you handling it? Or - are you handling it? In denial? Well, it's less than 3-days to the closing on my Mothers house. I was there today for the final inspection of the Village, and for a few other minor things. I'm able to walk thru the house without a lump in my throat. And that's good. Most of us come to that time where we have to accept - the time is near the end for someone - in my case it's Mom - a dementia patient. She will never go back to her home again. It will never be the same again. All those things are now memories!!!! In some ways it's sad of course ... but ... it is reality. Even though Mom still does complain some when I go to see her, I know she really does enjoy where she is at. The facility is very clean, modern and has caring care-givers. They have creative programs especially for dementia and other mind-destroying diseases. There are occassional local supervised trips (movies, horse-racing, etc.) - and weekly entertainers that come in - and in-house pets there daily. Selling her house keeps her there at least another two years! What more can be said!


 I wish I had something positive to add. My mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 10 years' ago; my sisters and I really doubt it is Alz, definitely dementia, but she just hasn't progressed like most do with Alz. Now she is in a nursing home and thankfully a good one, just five miles from me and she is public aid pending. It took me three months to fill out all the paperwork for Medicaid and we have been waiting for NINE months...we are in Illinois, the state is just about broke and does NOT want to grant anyone any money. I can't see how they will refuse her. I responded to every question they had. In any case, we wait... As far as what to do? I have two sisters that do help, but they work full time, I currently am out of work and I am her power of attorney, so most of the burden is on me. By burden I mean all the discussion with all her doctors, nurses and CNAs. My mother is extremely difficult, probably the most stubborn person they have met. I was told when she moved there, to the Alzheimer/dementia floor, that their staff is specially trained to take care of Alz/dementia people. They simply do not know what to do with her. I now get called every morning from her nurse asking me to please talk to her and get her to take her pills. She simply will not. For a while, I could say to her if you don't take them, I won't come visit you, and she would. Now she says ""good, don't visit me, I don't want to see you."" I went there yesterday at lunch, she still hadn't taken the morning pills, she has stopped eating breakfast too, and so I gently pleaded with her to take them for almost 15 minutes until she began screaming at me, told me as a daughter I am worthless, that I am good for nothing, which is something she has said to me since I was a very young child (she has always been a very nasty person) and so I gave up and left. It is getting more and more difficult to visit her. I go because I feel sorry for her and I am afraid she will not get the attention she needs if family doesn't show up. My sisters each go one day a week, on the weekends. I was going just about every week day. I am now cutting back. I have depression and anxiety and it has gotten so bad, and I know why, I know it's her, watching her go through this and as others have said, I realize she is not in any pain, she has absolutely no memory at all, but I feel as if it's killing me.


 One last time ...... I just came back from my Mothers house for the last time. There were a couple of other things of hers to bring back to my house. Closing is in less than 24-hours, and all the ""ducks seem to be in a row""! There still are no regrets. Mom lived there for almost 60-years ... but she doesn't even remember what her house looks like or where it is - now! At least there are very few bad memories from her old home. Time to close the book there.


 Isn't that the truth?! So awesome of your Mom's friends. My sister's do that very thing for my Mom; make her up outfits to wear so she is always looking pretty. Very nice! How is the closing on her house going?


 Hi Gizzie, My thoughts go out to you. My father had alzheimers and went through all the stages within one year. The day he passed away he was suppose to go into a nursing home. I don't think he wanted to go. My mum had to sell the family house due to bad health and moved into a retirement home where she only lived for about 4 months. Was a awful place. So I know exactly how you feel. Unfortunately my sister lives in Ottawa so I delt with this. Remember to take care of yourself.


 I was over there Sunday, but I brought my dog with to see her. The dog was a little overwhelmed with all of the strangers there and started to howl - so all three of us went outside for our visit. It was a beauty of a day - about 76 degrees with a light wind and sunny - blue skies!!! Mom really does like it when I bring Gizmo over to see her, and Giz has seen her enough to feel very comfortable with her. For Christmas, I put together a collage of photos and bought a frame that holds 10 or 12 photos ... gave it to her last Christmas. There was a picture of her wedding, one of her parents, one of a family Christmas years ago, then photos thru the years of me, my two daughters, her dogs and finally Gizmo when he was a puppy. I thought it might bring a tear to her eye, but ... the dementia had progressed to the point of her being confused with the photos - even last Christmas. I asked her Sunday about the photo of her two (past) dogs, and I don't think she knew what i was talking about . Brought a tear to my eye though!


 Went to see Mom on a Monday .... which is unusual! It really was a nice morning, weatherwise, so I went over to Mom' Home for Dementia. There was a group of about 8 or 9 sitting outside in what was called a ""book club"". The facilitator asked as I approached if my Mother wanted to visit with me. So she was wheeled over toward me outside. We had a really nice sit down visit for 90-minutes or so - all outside because if was close to 80 degrees with low humidity and a light breeze - just beautiful. The ""book club"" actually was made up of readings that were prepared with copies given to everyone ... kind of simplified but intended to encourage the mind to search. Mom was in good spirits, and she remembered my daughters name. She wanted to see an old friend (sister-in-law) who lives over 400 miles away - and one of her neighbors that lived across the street. It is so sad ... Mom did give some jewelry to that neighbor long before she went into this home, and yet - the neighbor has not even visited her once in the 11-months Mom has been where she's at. All I could say about the neighbor was she really should be visiting you ... no other negatives from me. By noon, I wheeled her back inside - and to the dining room for lunch. A very pleasant time visiting ... for both of us. I can tell ... she really is feeling comfortable there. My hopes ... are that she can develop some fond memories even there. In fact, I think she already has.


 Hello ... I kind of hit a brick wall yesterday when going to see my mother at her ""assisted living home for dementia"". But first, a little background: Mom was living alone (at her insistance) from 1995 to mid-2011 - and was driving her car for approximately that timeframe ... until she fell in her Kitchen and could not get up. She went into the hospital for observation and when released, her doctor said she needed 24/7 care in her home. That was at the age of 93! For the next 15-months, she did have a 24/7 caregiver living in her home - and actually kind of got used to it! I think maybe it was a daughter-like relationship for her - since the caregiver was in her mid-50's. However, during those months, Mom had three different episodes - all in the late evening - all screaming that someone was in her home trying to kill her. The last episode was very bad, she was admitted into the psych ward of the local hospital ... and after over 4-weeks, the psychiatrist and her primary doctor both said she needed to go into a home that had nursing care or with a RN on staff. Mom's caregivers at home, were no longer able to contend with the level of dementia - in the psychiatrists opinion. So ... the search for a home started ... and luckily one was found within two weeks or so that specialized in dimentia patients - and that had a lot of ""home-y"" type of things going on there. She was moved from the hospital to the Assisted Living home last September. I suppose the very typical reactions happened - and for months - on and off. That is, she would ask ""how long am I going to be here"" or ""when am I going to go home""? But, gradually she did get used to many of the nice aspects of this Assisted Living home - and I saw her enjoying herself very often when visiting. Now ... over the course of the past 26-months of care (either in her own home or in the AL home) - her savings have dwindled down to pretty low levels. For 10-months now, her old home has been vacant and has been costing $500. or so/month to just barely maintain - with taxes, insurance and basic utilities. Since she will never be going back home, and with her money account getting smaller, her home had to be put on the market for sale. The months of May and June were spent doing fairly minor things to her home - and it went on the market a few weeks ago. The home went into contract in a short period of time - with a closing set-up for the end of this month. First ... the money from the sale of her home will allow her to stay in her current AL home - and delay or avoid going into a Medicaid Nursing Home. Second ... it is one responsibility off my back - going to her house 3x a week the past two months and once a week for the past 18-years. I am going thru major medical problems myself - including advanced prostate cancer (2+ years), kidney failure (2+ years) and COPD (5+ years). Yesterday, I brought over to Mom some lighter weight clothes - her request from last week-end - in the colors she asked for. She immediately got nasty with me, wanted for us to go into her room for some privacy - and then it escalated to a level I hadn't seen for at least a year. She did make up a few innocent-type of stories (signs of her deteriorating dementia I think) - and then (as she had been doing in the past for at least the last 15-years) complained to me that she doesn't know why she didn't have a daughter because ""they do so much more for their mothers than sons do""! It's been well over a year since I've heard that criticism ... but she was telling me that over and over - for at least the past 15-years. I did see a therapist, 18-years ago, for a number of things going on at the time - and the therapist told me my mother has been laying a guilt trip onto me since I was a kid! So ... this isn't from dementia! I do not have any brothers or sisters (hardly my fault) - my Mom had been married three times and was an alcoholic (also hardly my fault) - and now ... my question for me is: ""What to do""??? Any thoughts would be appreciated!


 What do you feel in your heart that you should do? Also, it will get worse, as litterly they go back in time to a kid. Mentally, they slip back as a kid and eventually, a baby but trapped in an adult body. It is extremely difficult and emotional for everyone. There will be ""up's"" and ""down's"" as they will also hallucinate as well. I had to learn during the down times to not let it get to me, as they do not realize what they say. You do what you are doing, continue to love, cherish, support her. We had to sell my gma's house too. And not all Medicaid homes are bad, it is just finding the right one. If you aren't able to keep her in that home, which I suggest to do as long as you can, but start looking for one just in case. Don't call ahead and schedule a tour. Show up out of the blue, on the spot. Talk to the residents, see if they are happy or not. By doing that you help cast away the not so good homes, and you see as they truly are. Visit her often, at all times of day, don't get into a pattern of visitation. I used to work in a nursing home, a pretty bad one at that, and the CNA's would let them be soiled for hours on end, til a diaper rash happened, it was horrific. The only ones that got the best treatment were the ones that had visitors that showed up on a routine. After moving Gma to a home, I showed up every day at different times for awhile, then I moved to every other day and I'd always change my habbit, and have some days I'd show up 3 days in a row, miss a day come back so on. They want a company to look good, to keep business going, its about money basically. So I did that to get my Gma the best care possible. I even stayed the night a couple times. That facility was Medicaid/Medicare and was really wonderful. I paid attention to all patients there, keeping an eye out for faults. Everyone was treated well. I am thankful I found that facility, but it is a man hunt. The facility had multiple buildings, ranging from assisted living to nursing, to respite to dementia to alz..it was nice. If the needs changed, she just changed buildings and rooms. Her care stayed the same - good decent care and they cared. I hope this helped, just some ideas to think about .


 Update ....... I saw Mom yesterday and talked to her buildings nurse and to the social director. First ... she was much better (state of mind) - but looked and acted as though she had aged many months in a week. It was time for the patient review with the nurse and social director, and Mom has not withdrawn at all ...... that's a good thing. And the group did find her leather coat - that was missing the last time I was there. It always helps to believe your parent isn't getting ripped off at the Assisted Living Home. I had lunch with her there ... forgot how small the portions are! And believe it or not, too much salt on what I think was Beef Chop Suey - modified with non-chinese vegetables. The vegetables were very good though - fresh just like I've been told they use. Another day - but this time a pretty good one.


 Thanks for the kind thoughts and words. I wish there was someone else who could step in. I'm kind of disgusted that my Mothers closest two neighbors, for over 10-months now of Mom being in Assisted Living, have not gone to see her once - or even asked me how she's doing. For the past two months, I've been over to her house thre times a week (average) and for the eight months prior to that, was over to her house weekly. I guess the one neighbor that my Mother always asks about , got what she wanted from my Mother in the past ... at least one small diamond necklace (that I know of). And the other neighbor always has been so full of himself, if someone isn't praising him for one thing or another, he doesn't want any part of that person. Very sad! Mom was used to ""buying love"" - at least from others. My youngest daughter - and an old friend of my Mothers (closer to my age though) both have been very helpful the past two weeks over at Mom's house. Coincidentally ... those two are on my Mothers old Living Trust as Successor Trustees - in case (or whenever) I cannot be the Successor Trustee. They both seem to have been working together pretty well lately - so that gives me a sense of comfort if I'm not able to do the things I have been doing on my Mothers behalf at somepoint in time. When I was in at my Oncologists office Thursday, a volunteer from the American Cancer Society was there - and spent a little time talking to me. He lost his wife to cancer just over a year ago ... and I think he has me convinced to seek a local support group. My social life has been nearly non-existant for more than to 2-years now. I'm not at all a hermit, but I have resisted developing close friendships over the past two years or more. Your point of forgiving my Mother was well taken. I think I have. Actually, if I hadn't, I don't think I would still be caring so much about what happens to her. And ..... your point about dementia being more difficult on the loved ones ... is very true ... I think! The forum at HW is something I found by accident a little over a month ago, and sincerely hope that I can bring as much or more to the forum - as I am taking away from it. It is a solid step forward in this most recent chapter of life. Thanks again ... and peace to you.


 Hello Minette ... Couldn't help but notice that you are new to HW - or at least appear to be. Let me be the first to welcome you . I will be giving the Cancer Society a call to find an appropriate support group for meetings. Thanks again. I just got back from my Mothers house, and my youngest daughter worked her head off cleaning up the garage. She and a friend of my Mothers spent much of this week-end doing the final preparations for the closing of my Mother's house. With the closing scheduled for this coming Friday, I will soon have one large monkey off my back. Sad to see the end of an era ... but it's going to enable Mom to stay in her Assisted Living arrangement thru at least 2015 - because of the additional finances before having to consider a Medicaid Nursing Home. Best wishes and peace in your life.


 huggss gizzy.... i know how chemo is on the body I been off and on it since 2008. you hang in there! remember zofran zofran lol (top of line nausea med) I love my zofran. And remember to rest, and it is ok to let others to help. If you ever need to talk about it, let me know!


 I hear you Gizzy. We sold my parent's house about two years ago, and whenever I drive through the area I am reminded of all the good and tough times that we had -- but all in all, they are memories. I miss my Dad so much and miss my Mom being around the corner, but she is in good hands at her new home, and my siblings are taking great care of her. Take care Gizzy, and just wanted to know I'm thinking about you!


 To MT Lady: I understand the financial situation - being from Illinois myself. There is one program not well-known, and I am certain it's a federal program. It is available only to former members of the armed forces or their spouse. If your Father was in the armed forces, and your Mothers total estate is worth no more than around 30k as I recall - then she complies with the requirements. The benefit is somehow prorated, but it typically is close to $1000. per month for the rest of her life. That's a drop in the bucket for Nursing Home costs, but it is available to people on Medicaid - so it ends up being a supplementary small income that helps with medication costs, miscellaneous items and can be partially saved for - eventually the final costs. Once my Mothers lifetime of savings, and the balance from the sale of her house tomorrow get down to in the area of $30,000. total balance left, I will apply for that aide, as well as, getting her on Medicaid (which I think has the same net worth requirement). It's not a great deal of comfort, but at some point, it will be needed ... as long as she survives to that financial point. I think you're fortunate to have a Nursing Home with a 5-star rating close to you - and one that also (as I understand it) works with Medicaid or has some Medicaid assigned beds. Sorry to hear that your Mother is that difficult. Mine can be - but she isn't always. It's tough! Best Wishes to you and your family


 Sometimes it's the little things that count! Yesterday, two of my Mothers friends went to see her ... and brought over a couple of pairs of slacks and blouses for her - lightweight for the Summer - and some of the balance from her house that was just sold. They went thru her little closet and grouped or paired slacks with blouses or lightweight sweaters ... asked her if there were any she didn't like ... and then hung them up as ""outfits"" for the caregivers when Mom is being dressed. It raised Mom's spirits!!! Then, one of the ladys took my Mothers lipstick (for color) and said she would pick her up another lipstick ... then asked what kind or shade of powder she wanted so she could pick up some basic make-up. I hear that Mom really liked that attention. I was just a small gesture ... but it was highly appreciated! I'll go see her today - dying to hear her story of her visitors yesterday!


 To Lonie: Thanks for your thoughts ... I was beginning to wonder about my Mother's few friends. But they DID come thru like champs on Friday. My folks used to show dogs - 30 to 40-years ago, so I brought over a throw pillow yesterday that I think was darned ... for her. It was of her first Westie ""Buttons"", and she just held it on her lap the hour that I was there. And I brought a large framed photo of their first two West Highland White Terriers ... and asked one of the caregivers if she could make sure it was mounted on the wall over Mom's bed sometime during the week. The house closing went fine. I still have quite a few things in my garage, so this week's goal is to get rid of some of my things, so I can move some of Mom's things in with me ... mainly seasonal clothing changes. And then, there's two suitcases + two boxes full of photos ..... that's going to be tough going thru! I guess it really isn't quite ""time to close the book""! Best wishes to you ... and thanks!


 Gizzie -- did they hang the picture for you? We did the same thing with my Mom's room -- put a lot of of her memento's in her room. We have a picture of my Dad up there too, and she told me she likes it there because she can have words with him because he left her too soon. Then she gives a little giggle and she gets a little teary eyed. She really misses him...but they were married for 61 years! Hope your Mom continues to do well.


 I was at the Psychologists office today ......... I did a little going back in the past with him - namely about losing three close friends to death in the past 7-years ... and about two failed relationships in the past 15-years. But ...... I did also want to know the differences between Alzheimers and Dementia. I couldn't possibly repeat what he said by memory but ... the Dementia is much more common and is essentially the deterioration of the brain cells. Alzheimers is much more complicated than I had thought. And while Dementia is typically a progressive deterioration of memory when someone gets older, Alzheimers can strike people in their 40's. This Psychologist specifically works with people with terminal diseases, and he stated that his youngest patient with Alzheimers died in his (her) 40's! Summary ... as I had suspected, my Mom has Dementia. My Grandmother who passed over 20-years ago just may have had Dementia - even though everyone called it Alzheimers. It is possible that 20-years ago, Alzheimers was misdiagnosed. The Alzheimers is more neurological in basis and can be treated with medications - to a degree. The Dementia can be caused by excessive alcohol or any other means of brain cell destruction - and it to can be treated to a degree, but much differently. We didn't get into which of the two, if either, is hereditory. Just the bare tip of the iceberg ... of information.


 Just an update .......... The last couple of times I've gone over to see Mom has been on a Monday now ... tried early aftrnoon last time. She was at the Beauty Shop there, so I stopped by to say Hi ... then went outside of that building to sit for awhile. It was another beautiful day out. When she came out, I suggested staying there because the shade was good - and her eyes are very sensitive to the sun glare. While we were out, a few of the house dogs came by - one sat next to us ... a half dozen of varying workers came by saying ""hello"" ... and about the same amount of patient/residents came by. What I saw in my Mother, was a sense of peace ... and actually a sense of belonging too. She started telling me some stories - and her stories were about where she used to live - about different people. It took me awhile, but I finally figured out she was really talking about where she's at right now - not her old home. Of course with dementia, she creates some things ... but now she's creating things (and people) from her surroundings at the home for Assisted Living. I really think that if she were able to go back to her old home, she would feel lost there. There's activity around her often even if she may not want to be a part of it at times. It's still there. After a little under an hour of outdoor sitting, I asked her if she wanted to join in on the Bingo game that was already going on inside. While we were sitting out there though, two of the care-givers that came by complimented her hair. Yeah ... her hair is still a big thing to her. She goes to the beautician there every other week ... just like she used to at home. Then it was time for Bingo. A nice day!"
Ways to prevent Alzheimer's Disease very early?,"Hello, my mother and father are currently 47 and 52 years old respectively , and I needed some help on my little situation. I want to make sure, or at least lower the risks of dementia and Alzheimer's. Is there any good way to go about this? I want to try to help my parent's as much as I can, but how can I do it in a way without offending or worrying them? They don't really exhibit any of the symptoms of one with dementia would experience, but I really want to prevent anything from happening to begin with. I just wanted to know if there were any ways I could go about the situation so I can guarentee them healthy senior years.","There is really is no guarantee that they will even get it. Your parents can very well live to a very old age with their mind intact. But here is a website that can be helpful: http://www.livestrong.com/article/303337-the-best-supplements-to-prevent-alzheimers-senile-dementia/


 Avoid toxins and eat a healthy diet. Stay away from process foods, fast food, and GMO food. The raw fruits and vegetables have the vitamins and minerals we need to prevent disease. Get exercise everyday to keep the blood circulating. Get proper sleep so the body can repair itself. Prayer and meditation to relieve the stress. You should be able to avoid all disease.


 There are new studies coming out linking alsheimers disease to oxidative stress caused by free radical damage Here is one of the studies http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9850931/ Antioxidant rich foods like dark green leafy veggies are proven to reduce free radicals and there is even a new antioxidant supplement called protandim that causes the body to create antioxidant enzymes that will reduce free radicals at a much higher rate than antioxidants alone. My grandmother has been taking this supplent for a few months now and her memory has dramatically improved. I can only imagine how much better off she could have been if she could have been taking this for a longer period of time. Prevention is the best medicine :) Post Edited By Moderator (LanieG) : 10/30/2014 9:27:02 AM (GMT-6)


 Some recent research is starting to uncover the benefits of St John's Wort for the prevention and treatment of Dementia and AD. Scientists are still very early in the discovery process, but given there are very few substances providing hope so far, it's an interesting avenue to consider. St John's Wort has helped me considerably for many other conditions, and I have not noticed any visible detrimental side effects. Beware, however of possible interactions with other drugs, and read about them before trying SJW. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23701205


 My strategy is to 1. Get tested for Sleep Apnea 2. Get tested for the APOE genes. 23andme offers the testing for a reasonable rate. You can run the data file via Promethease and it will tell you if you have it. 3. Take antioxidants and Vitamin D. 4. Exercise (even gentle exercise). 5. If you have diabetes, or other inflammatory or blood vessel diseases, control them well.


 Well, heck that is really very sweet! I'm 55, but don't show any signs yet of dementia. My mother has dementia, and was a huge crossword puzzle person, an accountant, and loved things like Wheel of Fortune. She never forgot a birthday or a date...she was amazing. The only thing I feel she was lacking was nutrition because she ate very small portions and was thin all of her life. Never reached 100 lbs. She never ate fruits or veggies. You might want to google more information on ways to prevent Alzheimers or dementia. I know Dr. Oz has some good tips on his website. Take care, and again...very sweet of you to think about your parents welfare!


 There are foods you can eat that help to prevent Alzheimers - LOTS of omega 3 foods - hemp seeds, chia seeds, wild caught salmon, avocados, coconut oil are all really great sources of omega 3 fats. You really can't overdo these.


 Get their blood levels of vitamin D tested. They don't have to know that it is a precaution against Alzheimer's. Google “vitamin D heart disease”, “vitamin D cancer” or vitamin D anything. You could tell them that it is for their general health. www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/researchers-say-vitamin-d-deficiency-raises-alzheimers-risk/2014/08/06/ed278fde-1da1-11e4-82f9-2cd6fa8da5c4_story.html?hpid=z4


 Found a good article explaining the various herbs and spices which protect the brain. I put turmeric at the top of the list. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZngT16FsyE


 There are studies showing low levels of vitamin D are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Most people are low in vitamin D. I thought my level was fine. I was eating salmon and taking Cod liver oil. I had my level checked and it was 19 ng/ml. The recommended level is 30 - 90 ng/ml. I started taking 5000 IU a day and spending 10 min in front of a sun screen and got my level up to 72 ng/ml. The only way to know if you are deficient is to get the test. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfh2vPTE4Lg"
Dad Has Alzheimer's. First Visit in 9 Years.,"On Monday I will be visiting my Dad in a nursing home. Due to family nastiness, I haven't been allowed any access to him in approximately 9 years, and now that I may visit I will be with him as often as is possible. Please don't judge.. I would have been there for him this whole time were it an option for me. The last time I saw my Dad he was vague, but he was himself. Now, he doesn't walk, he can't lift his head, he can't feed himself, and, from what I have heard, he is entirely non verbal. We do not know what he does or does not remember, but he does smile when his wife walks into the room. I don't want to say the wrong things to him. I know that he is more likely to remember some of the distant past, but I don't want to act as though he should remember it. I don't want to cause him frustration from lack of memory, but I also don't want to talk down to him. I worry that even calling him ""Dad"" could cause him stress. His wife reads to him. I suppose that reading is a safe option, but I want to talk to him. I am not looking for advice other than in how to approach him verbally in the first visit. Once I am past this hurdle, hopefully I will be able to find my own way. Thanks.","Unfortunately, I think there's no way to avoid at least some pain. Alzheimer's is truly cruel to its victims, who have made no poor choices to bring it on. It just comes, and it takes away. I have no idea what this 'family nastiness' is that you speak of, but it is truly insensitive and horrible. Your family should be welcoming and taking care of your father, not shutting him out. To not be able to walk or even feed yourself is terrifying. I've experienced it, when I was very sick and weak. It's one of the scariest states to be in imaginable. Your Dad might want to think about how long he wants to hold on. I know that's a terrible question, but better he thinks and decides than people left debating about it for years. The best I can suggest for the time being is to try and talk as naturally with him as you can, as close to as how you once did. Try to avoid distractions in the room, and bring up memories. If he finds himself not being able to remember, tell him the story. Everyone loves stories.


 Wow David, first of all I am so glad you get to see your Dad. My Father was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, so my situation is different than yours. I can't give you any advice on how to approach him, but if it was my Father, I could only approach him how I always would, with a great big hug( gently though)and go from there. When my Father was in the hospital for something unrelated to Alzheimer's, and he would have issues towards the evening, he would bring up a lot of things from his childhood. I would listen like it was the first time I heard it. In your situation, if my Father was non-verbal, I could imagine you worrying about what he remembers, but maybe if when you talk to him you bring up happy memories, something you remember you both enjoyed together? I would want him to know how much I love him, and how happy I am to see him. I think the reading is a good idea, and sometimes just sitting there with them saying nothing at all can be a great comfort. My heart truly goes out to you. I'm sure this post is not the most helpful, but I want you to know I empathize with you and care."
MIL with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,"Hi, I am new here, i came across this site and hoping to get some advice or just vent even. Let me start by saying i am 42 this past October me and my husband celebrated out one year anniversary, we have been together for 3 years. I have known him for almost 10 years. His wife left him and eventually we started seeing each other. Anyways, since i have come into the picture his mother had already been showing signs of Parkinson's it took me 6 months to convince him to change her doctor. When he finally did he immediatly reffered her to a Neurologist, where she was diagnosed with Parkinson's, by this time we were already living together and engaged. (note: she was living with my husband for 5 years before we got together) We got married and her condition got worse. It is now starting to have a strain on our marriage. He is an only child, his father passed away when he was 18, and my husband is all she has, he tells me this all the time, he is in serious denial about her worsening condition, she isn't bathing, she refuses to go anywhere, her fear of public places is getting worse, forgetting our names, and if she has even eaten anything, she is losing her balance a lot to the point of severe brusing where she leans to catch herself, when we ask her about it, she says it is nothing, my last straw was a deep purple bruise on her hand and when he asked her about it she said ""she didnt mean to do it"" and he asked ""Who?"" and she said ""that girl"" and said my name, he has to monitor her meds, her bills and tell her when to take a bath, and fixes plates for her, it is to the point where everyday life revolves around her, i feel like i am being selfish and uncaring. He keeps telling me ""If you only knew how she was before."" I dont hate her i care for her, but she is so disconnected from people and life already how can i possibly bond closley with her? He gets frustrated with me when i tell him about episodes of her forgetting or saying off the wall things. My fear is if i don't and something happens to her, he will say ""You knew about this and didn't tell me?"" I constantly listen to how frustrated he is with her, and all he can say is ""What do I do?"" or ""What can I do?"" I have considered leaving the marriage over the stress of this situation, I feel like I am responsible for her only when it suits him, but any input into her medical treatment is a no no, unless he asks, and i refuse to suggest anything, for fear it will backfire on me, when something goes wrong. I am at my wits end!!!","There is no doubt about it. Your life IS on hold. My mom has PD and dementia and it's been 24/7 for the past 9 years. The PD wasn't so bad and she's had that for over 25 years but once the mind went then all hell broke lose. You have to really be committed to taking on the caregiver role or the resentment will kill you. I'm 47 and never married or have anyone in my life and it's my choice. None of my 3 siblings want to help so be it. MIL is family but not your real mom so it is much more stressful and the emotional bond is not as strong. I feel for you both and I'm doing it and living this everyday. Stay well and know you are not alone.


 Hello. I'm also new to the forum. My great aunt has been living in my home for the past 3 years. She was not very close or kind to me before she developed AD, but family pressure and circumstances prevailed and here we are. I wish I had more than kind words to offer you. I hope your situation improves without you having to leave your marriage. I'm in my 40's and divorced, and the stress of AD is very overwhelming and I often feel like my life is on hold. Just wanted to reach out to you and say that I empathize and you sound like a very good person in a very hard and delicate situation. Best of luck to you.

"Trouble talking, is this Alzheimer’s?","Well If I start to talk and I cant get words out Could this be dementia? yes- I am going to a dr., but a long wait until I see him","start and lose the rest of the sentence(3 words are lost) I am a senior lady 68 other times .I cant start the sentence at all cant spell a word.. I have Bipolar and taking medicine for it ps-very educated ps-married


 went to DR- and tested me of presidents-


 Can you give us a lot more information? Does this happen with every sentence? Do you evently get the words out? Do you feel like you know what you want to say but can't remember the words?


 I can be from a variety of things - from your medication, dehydration, hormones and yes possibly dementia. It's good that you are seeing the doctor. When is your appointment?


 Carenpolar, I can understand your fear. I have a calendar for appointments and a ""To Do List."" Watching the Glen Campbell Documentary and ""Still Alice"" was informative but also scary. My doctor gave me the screening and the last question was name a brand of pencil. I said a Detroit Tigers pencil I bought for the Grandkids. I passed 100%. One thing he said was my brain is cluttered with so much information that it may take time to remember things. He didn't seem concerned. Actually I think my husband forgets more things than I do. The again, aging, lack of sleep, dehydration, and Xanax might be the problem? I so fear getting AL. My Aunt got it at 79 years old. It's hard to gage what is ""normal"" and what are warning signs. Good luck at your appointment. Exactly what will the doctor(s) do?"
Dealing with dementia of family member,I was wondering if there is anyone could help me with the 'stages' of dementia. My mother in law (mil) is in the 3rd stage?? Any help greatly appreciated-just need to talk. thank you,"Hi Steve, Thanks for respnding. We are also in the middle of selling her house. She knows she can never go back there to live (she is in a retirement home right now where she has been for 1 1/2 years),but sometimes she will say to us 'it is still my house and if I want to go there,I can'. But all of her personal stuff has been moved out and the house is just staged for the sale. She will forget stuff in 10 min that she just discussed. It's real hard. When we go to visit her sometime she will tell us we have not been there ina month and she has been abandoned.. We live about 5 minutes from the home so that is not at all true. Hard to handle right now


 I ended up going to see my MIL a 2nd time last nite. She called my husband and said she was very scared,that she wanted to go to her 'other room'(there is only 1 room). I got on the phone and could hear she was on the verge of tears so I told her I would be right there. Luckily we are only about a 5 minute ride from the home. When I got there she was pretty upset. I sat with her and asked her where her other room was. She said she wasn't sure. I asked her if it is in the building that we could walk to it or it we had to take the car to get to it. She wasn't too sure. I reminded her that the room she is in is her only room and again showed her all of her pics. She was ok then and no longer had to go to another room but she wanted to know who put her in 'this place' and why. I explained that almost 2 years ago she fell off her treadmill(she's 91 but wanted to keep her looks!LOL) Instead of turning the speed down,she turned it up and it spit her out the back breaking her arm and a hairline fracture of her kneecap. So she could no longer stay in the house alone so she was taken to Rosedale(the retirement home where she has been since then). She said 'well, I wish people would tell me all of this,cuz I don't remember ANY of that!'. What could I say to that? Just today myself and her daughter Bonnie were there to see her and my husband John called to see how her was and she said she was lonely cuz nobody had been to see her. He called at 6:30pm and we were there about 2pm?? I did see my husband tear up a couple days ago,the first time since she was in I think. Diana


 Hi, Thanks for your response. It is so good to hear from someone that is experiencing the same thing we are. Ma does not know she has Dementia. I swear it happened overnite!. She has a temper that she never had, it just 'isn't ma' as we say. My SIL and I had a little talk yesterday after we had Thanksgiving dinner at the home where ma is. She said we have to remember this is a different ma and we have to learn how to love her all over again. It's so sad. I have only been in the family for 9 years but for my husband,John and his sister,Bonnie it has to be overwhelming. I actually saw my husband tear up for the time last week.I don't remember if I said we are going to support groups and that helps but on the days there is no support group,there is really noone to speak to. I have been looking around to see if there is someplace else we can contact,or even speak to online but other than this one,nothing really.I do have a sense of humor also but lately it is lacking.

Any help greatly appreciated-just need to talk. thank you DeeDee, I have just recently taken over the care of my MIL with Alzheimers. My MIL is 87 and my FIL is 88. He had been doing the best he could to take care of her in their home up until the beginning of November when he became very ill and was hospitalized. He now has been in the hospital four weeks and my MIL has been living with my family. Years ago my father had Alzheimers before he died and I am somewhat familiar with the stages but it has been exhausting taking care of my MIL full time. She is lost most of the time and really doesn't know what to do next. I direct her throughout the day from one activity to another. Sometimes she knows us and sometimes she doesn't. Her short term memory is almost completely gone although sometimes she can retain some new information. She can still feed herself if I put the food in front of her and she can dress herself and brush her teeth and hair if I lead her through the processes. Left to do it herself she just turns round and round trying to figure out what to do. I want her to have as much independence as possible but I will not let her become agitated trying to do it alone. For quite some time now she has been having problems with soiling herself somewhat. She will take off her underwear and wash it out and hang it to dry. After bring her to my house and going back to her's to collect belongings she needed I found bag after bag of soiled underwear that needed to be thrown away. She also, for some unknown reason, will used the toilet paper she uses and put it in the waste basket instead of flushing it down the toilet. I have to follow after her and clean up any messes she makes. In her mind she is doing the right thing. She is still enough herself that she tries to ""hide"" these accidents from us and I never let her know I'm cleaning up. I have come to this forum just to talk about how to be a good caregiver and not become burnt out in the process. We may end of with my FIL living with us also when he gets out of the hospital. It has not been determined yet whether a skilled nursing facility is best for him or if it would be better for him to come here. They will never be able to go back to there on home. Looking forward to getting to know others in this same situation and maybe learning from them.


 livingngrace said... Hi, My name is Gina and I have taken care of my Mother who had dementia for over eight months, and she is now in a nursing facility. I know about the caregiving and the stressors. Susie, I had my best friends fiL that did the same thing with the bathroom issue. He would go to the bathroom in the utility closet. Bless their hearts, they seem to get really confused with that, but seem to too, know that something is off. When I took care of mother she was in the beginning stages and it was so hard to tell with her what was dementia and what was her not wanting to remember.

She must be in the later stages, (I don't know stages) because she is aware that she is loosing her mind. she screams a lot. Or she did when she got phenomena. The hospital had to sedate her very heavily, she just screamed and screamed. It was harrowing. Incredibly stressful, for her and the family. Once momma got better she told us that she knew she was loosing her mind. At least in mom's case, she's went from one stage (or at least it's seemed) to another and back. One thing that I do know, it's hard. It's hard work -- emotionally exhausting and mentally taxing. It takes courage and fortitude, compassion and guts. I took care of my dad for eight years. He'd had a stroke that was caused by a aneurysm in his brain. Two aneurysms really. He was a walking miracle. I cherished everyday with him. So I understand and am here to support. God will bless each and everyone of you!!!! Grace blessings, Gina Gina thank you so much for the support and sharing your story. My MIL is not mean or angry but before my own father died from the illness he was angry most of the time until he couldn't speak any more. She is just lost and sad. She knows she has memory problems and apologizes to us. She really doesn't know just how bad it is. Her personality has changed much although she is much quieter due to the fact she cannot carry on a conversation. She has ""wrote"" things she says over and over again. However, the other day she was in the car with my husband and adult daughter on their way to visit my FIL in the hospital. While at the hospital she held his hand but said almost nothing during the entire visit. Then, on the way home my daughter was in the backseat and carrying on a conversation with her father. All at once my MIL said, ""Will you PLEASE make her stop talking!"" ""She has been talking ALL EVENING!"" My daughter was shocked at that outburst and came home in tears. She had never had her grandmother say such a thing to her and use that tone of voice. She understood that it was the illness that made her grandmother do that but it hurt her terribly. Then, two days later her grandmother apologized to her for saying that to her. Then, I was shocked that she even remembered it had happened. My daughter is now skittish to talk with her grandmother in fear it may happen again. You are right about how hard it is taking care of someone you love and who isn't the person you've known all your life. I'm glad you had the time with your father before he passed away. Stay in touch and thank you again for your encouraging words. Susie


 Three Stages of Dementia, What to Expect. www.understanding-dementia.com/stages-of-dementia.html My dad is also stage three. It's pretty tuff on everyone...But he's in a memory care center...


 Guessing you've learned to not argue with her... The good news about her being mad that you haven't visited (or so she thinks) is that she'll forget she's mad. Tuff part for us is that my dad is pretty good in the first part of the day and keeps begging us to not lock in up in the physc ward... We keep telling him to stop beating on the nurses with his cane... Course he doesn't remember that part..


 Hi Diana and welcome to this forum, I mostly post at the Crohn's forum since I have the disease, but I check here occasionally since my father had the disease. There's no denying how hard emotionally and physically Alzheimer's and other dementias are on families. My father was told up front that he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and he understood what that meant since he had uncles and an aunt with the disease years before. It helped him to cope when we reminded him that it was the illness that was making him forget and causing his body to stop working properly. I don't know if your MiL knows she has the disease; I'm sure there are families that choose not to broach the subject with the patient, but for my dad it worked better to talk about it. My mother had Parkinson's and when she would have hallucinations, it was easier for her to cope when I reminded her that it was the disease firing the images. It sounds like you're doing a good job helping her cope with being there and calming her when she was afraid. It may be helpful to her if you put a calendar in her room and when you visit, write something on the day you visit so that she has something visual. We tried different things with my dad like that. I had his newspaper delivered to the home he was in even though he could no longer read as such, but it helped him pin down what day it was and it was a familiar touchstone from his life at home. One thing we learned with my Dad was that when he suddenly became far worse with the dementia symptoms, was to look for a physical cause. If dementia patients get an infection, it can really ramp up their dementia. Dad's bladder was affected by the disease and he would get infections that would send him into another dimension. We learned to watch for sudden changes. I found the stages of the disease listed on several medical websites also.


 I'm sorry there's not a lot of posting here. I'm sort of used to the Crohn's forum where people post daily even though I'm not online daily myself. It does help to talk to others dealing with these issues.

"Husband has sundowners, moving to care facility","Found this forum today. Guess I just needed to hear other stories and be able to talk at times. My DH was diagnosed in 2009 with Alzheimer's although there were signs before. He has sundowners, memory is about 5 minutes or less and is very OCD about certain things. I've already commented here a couple times about his locking and unlocking doors every day/night. The dead. Lots don't work anymore because they've been jerked on too many times. He obsesses over the doors up to 40 or so times a night. He tries to help by moving things around so that I can't find my toothbrush, pans, clothes and other things. I just spend a lot of time searching for things. There are so many things he says does, I couldn't begin to share them. I spend so much time irritated and angry with him and then I feel horrible because I know he can't help it. We've been married 57 years and I actually think about him dying and would I be sad about it. I know....that sounds so unloving and selfish. I strive not to be such a hideous wife. But lose it so often and treat him terrible. I just recently got him into a day care where he's been three times. He's so sweet and everyone loves him there. It's been a good break but it was heartbreaking to leave him there the first time...I was sick about walking away. My friends and family say I need to put him in a facility or at least plan to in the next few months but I can't imagine leaving him. He's very dependent on me and doesn't want me to be out of his sight. He waits for me outside the bathroom door. He's always been so good to me it seems the best thing is to stay home and make sure he's getting good food and care. I just don't know what is best. He's up till 12-3 or so every night and we just don't get much rest. Guess I'm tired.... Sorry for such long post, it just came spilling out. Thanks to all of you for being here.","Thanks Steve for the reply. No, he is not a vet and I'm thinking I'll need some help from Medicaid after a small spend down. I have friends and family who are saying to get a divorce so I can protect our assets which is mainly a home. Not sure this is a wise option. In the meantime, I remain his caregiver and the new respite has been a god send.


 Hi Angel, My father had Alzheimer's and I understand what you're going through. When we had to place my father into the nursing home with an Alzheimer's unit for his own protection, we wondered just what would happen to his property, but his needs were more important. My mother had already passed away. When you place a spouse in a nursing facility and you're still in your home, they won't take your home when Medicaid is needed to pay for his care, and you're allowed to keep one automobile for your use (at least that's how it was when we were going through it). It helps to call and speak to someone, either from a nursing facility's office staff, or your state's department of human services, to know just what takes place in your state when it comes to what the rules are. We were given all sorts of advice from friends who didn't know what they were talking about . We did spend down my father's savings (meaning we paid for his nursing home care by the month from his savings) and were starting to prepare for him to go into the Medicaid program, but he passed away before his savings ran out and we never had to deal with selling his home or property. I think it's time, for both your sakes, to place him in a facility. You have nothing to feel guilty about ; it's just that Alzheimer's is too difficult for a spouse to handle single-handedly. My father's major organs were affected as much as his mind, but we knew he had to be in a facility when he tried to make coffee in the night and came too close to potentially burning his house down - with him in it.


 Thoughts of the person dying or getting pushed off a cliff are pretty darn normal and OK as long as you don't actually push. (some of that is intended to be humorous) I bet if you asked him 25 years ago if he would want you to go through this he would have said no. So maybe let him do the daycare more often so you can get some rest... And it sounds like it's only a matter of time before he'll need a full lock down facility. Was he a vet by any chance? If so, there's a ton of benefits to be gotten.


 You might give coconut oil a try. It helps with some people.


 Thanks JaSanne, My hubby is in excellent physical health and appears happy enough. He does have times of anger when he can't find the things he's hidden the night before. He accuses me or someone breaking into the house of hiding his things. He is able to sit and listen to people talk, he can even engage in the conversation for a bit. He watches TV and can understand fairly well but can't follow a movie or anything much longer than a few minutes. My days are spent explaining common things, like ""this is our house, your mother passed away, she's not in the bedroom, etc.! It goes on all day. At night the sundowners starts and the door locking. Even with this, it doesn't seem like he's ready for a long term place. I have to figure that out. I did check with Medicaid and yes, I can keep the house as long as I want to live in it. But when I sell it or my kids sell it, they will put a lien on it and recoup all the money that has been spent on the facility. I'm thinking there is no way around that except, as some are telling me, to get a divorce. I'll keep the forum posted in case anyone else is having the same thoughts."
Experiencing long term memory gaps,"I'm not sure if I have a problem or the future possibility of a problem, but its' been bothering me and I thought that I would post and ask about it. I'm 68 and highly functioning. I live by myself and have a part time online business. I'm a retired contract programmer and have programmed and maintained my site with no problems. I am in the middle of rewriting my site (php5, mysql, css, html and javascript ) with no drop in my programming abilities. My problem is I have long term memory gaps. For example, I can't remember anything from the 4th grade, from 2009 or most other years. I would have to concentrate to remember anything I did last week. I remember pieces of significant events, but the everyday events are gone. I read quite a lot and am rereading novels I have read before. Most of the reread books are almost new to me. Do I have a problem or is just part of getting older?", 
Anyone who has experience with Aricept?,"Hi! I am seeking advice from anyone who has experience with Aricept. My Mother has not been formally diagnosed with Dementia but she does have bad short term memory and she is aware she does. She recently spent 5 days in ICU with 2 blood clots and just got home from 21 day of physical therapy at our local nursing home. She is diabetic and having to take insulin, has ulcerative colitis, and severe osteoarthritis in both knees. She is 83 years old. I just switched her to a new PCP who we saw on Friday and just casually said Mom could use some memory pills just to get his reaction. He immediately prescribed Aricept. Her previous PCP just said to have her take a Vitamin B Complex and dismissed anything other than that for her forgetfulness. I've read about some bad side effects and now I am not so sure I even want to start her on this med! I would sure appreciate anyone's opinion as I am just on the fence about her taking this drug right now.","Thank you so much for your reply. My one worry about this medicine is the side effect of an upset stomach. Her ulcerative colitis has been under control for several years with not one flare up so I don't want anything to change that. She is continuing to get physical therapy at home for several weeks and I think I will wait for her to get stronger before starting her on the aricept. Thanks again, your reply has been very helpful."
Mother having hard time adjusting to sleeping arrangements,"I am new on here and really need help. My sister and I have shared the care of our mother for three years now who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's four years ago. My sister lives in another state and we each get her for three months at a time, not ideal but the only way we can last at this. My sister's home is one story, mine is two-story. I had a stairlift put in at the beginning of this which mom works just fine. Problem is, now that the Alzheimers has really geared up she thinks her room upstairs is a totally separate place and she is alone. She wakes up in the night confused, gets up in the morning confused and agitated about where she is. I can't change the sleeping arrangements. It is what it is but I don't know how to help her. She sometimes calls me on my cell phone from her cell phone telling me she doesn't know where she is and someone needs to come get her. Just wonder if anyone else has ever been through this and what you did about it. It is emotionally exhausting!!!!","Our bedroom is on main floor. All the other bedrooms are upstairs. We live in the south so no basement and no other room on main floor to turn it into a bedroom. Her room upstairs has it's own bathroom attached to it. This arrangement has been going on for three years now. It is just now becoming an issue. I don't know how long this will last so I just cannot ask my husband to move upstairs and I won't sleep up there without him.


 I so appreciate your input. The stairs is definitely an issue. We have a stairlift and thank God, so far she remembers how to use it. We have talked of trying to put some kind of gate across the top so she can't attempt to come down or God forbid, fall down the stairs. If I could have foreseen this 23 years ago when we built this home we would have built a one story. I just cannot ask my husband to move all of his things upstairs to a much smaller room. We just bought an expensive bed for our backs for our room. All of our things are there. I know it doesn't make sense. He has sacrificed enough to let mom live here with us and has been so good about it. I just can't ask him to do that.


 The only thing I know to do is redirect her to her bed. Reorient her to the fact that it is bedtime and maybe sit in her chair a minute by the bed and read her a Psalm out of her Bible to calm her, pray for her , then say goodnight.


 When we sold her house, I brought all of her bedding, her curtains, family pictures on the walls that were in her home. I changed that whole room to look like her home. I bought her a powerlifting chair and a TV with cable for her room. So the whole room was transformed with all of her own things. As I was writing early in the morning she just called my name from upstairs. Said she had been at that motel all night, said my husband's brother had brought her there. No one here but us three. I thought about making some signs in the room that tells her she is in my home and safe.


 I would be very concerned that if a gate is put up at the top of the stairs, she may actually try to climb over it and fall. Disoriented Alzheimer patients don't think logically and realize the danger of their actions. My dad would have been either climbing over or taking it apart. At this stage of the disease, there's only so much you can do - she would probably be disoriented even if she were in her own home with everything just like it was. My dad didn't recognize his own home when he had an infection that ramped up his dementia - he thought ""home"" was when he was a boy and he wanted to go to that home and tried getting there on foot. You may be entering a time when you need outside help, whether it be sitters who take shifts to stay with her day and night or a nursing facility with an Alzheimer's unit. My dad's medical needs just became too immense for him to stay with us or us to stay with him.


 Is your bedroom on the main floor? Do you have kids on the main floor as well? Please expand on the houshold dianamics so we can understand better. When my Gma lived with us, we actually built a bedroom in the basement for my husband and I so she could be on the main floor. My kids were on the main floor as well and that seemed to help her with orientation.


 Unless there is some major reason you can't make the upstairs bedroom your new ""master"", I think that would probably be easier than trying to sleep every night waiting for your mom to get up confused and fall down the stairs. That seems inevitable to me. Your mother is probably not going to get any less confused with time.


 Odds are it doesn't matter where she sleeps....she'll still feel confused.


 Off the top of my head... Maybe if her room was full of colorful photos, artwork etc that when she wakes up they might help her to know where she is... Maybe the artwork could go with her when she stays with your sister.


 First Tristen's Nana, Let me say that you and your sister are wonderful daughters to take care of your mother this way. When my mom died, it was decided at the funeral my dad would move from NJ to DE to stay with me. Both my siblings worked, so this seemed to be the logical solution to them. We also had a two-story house, so I turned our den into my dad's room. It was really dreary at first, but I tore out the carpeting, so he wouldn't trip with the walked, and I put in a card table 4 feet from the tv so he could watch it. I would be concerned about the steps. There are gates that are stronger than ordinary baby gates that can actually be attached to your walls. I kept the doors to the garage and basement locked, so he wouldn't open them and fall down the stairs. Even though your mom is upstairs, I would still ""adult proof"". If your mother can still understand notes, you could put notes on her door and in her bathroom to remind her where she is. We had a cat, Will, that seemed to understand my dad needed him, so he hung out with him all the time. The other cats were aloof. Patty"

I am aware that some tracking products exist on the market but from research and personal experience (my Aunt is my Grandma's primary carer), I thought that these were either too expensive or needlessly complicated. I would love to get your opinion and speak to family members, friends and carers about what experiences you have had with trackers, wandering, getting lost, tech in general and anything you would like to see on the market. I have made a quick questionnaire (link below) and would be really grateful if you could take the time to fill it out. If you would rather not then any comments or thoughts on the subject would be greatly appreciated. Izzy, I have removed your link at this time. You must have the admin's permission to post this information. You can email him at Administrator@HealingWell.com.. Thanks Post Edited By Moderator (straydog) : 11/6/2016 9:40:13 AM (GMT-7)", 
Is there a link between seizures and Alzheimer's?,"Is there a link between seizures and Alzheimer's? I really believe my mom is having seizures and going into psychotic states and that it's part of her alzheimers. She is in the ER today because of talking about murder and striking staff at the nursing home, yet yesterday was a very good day for her. So I'm thinking it's possible she had a seizure last night. My brother needs to ask about this as he has POA (power of Attorney) on my mom and lives closer to her. It's just hard for me...She's in Michigan and I'm in Texas... Also, are there are tests for Alzheimer's? My brother says there are none and just lets the doctor say she has dementia. I thought there was testing for alzheimers, so what is true? Thank you and thank you for letting me vent, it's been frustrating.","Check out the Ketogenic diet. Some people find it helpful with dementia and alzheirmer's.


 When you say ""seizures"", can you describe exactly what you mean? Epileptic-type seizures are relativekly rare in Alzheimers. There are a battery of tests that can be done for dementia - its very important to screen for easily reversible causes eg Vit deficiences. Elena


 Sounds like dementia to me... Maybe with some Sundowners thrown in. My dad escaped from his care center and went to a nearby neighborhood to warn people about the little green men that was here to take over.... When he first started with Sundowners I finally got to talk to him first hand about seeing people in his apartment.... I mentioned that they sound like nice people and it could be good to have company.... I asked him if it bothered him that they were there... He looked at ME like I had lost MY mind... ""Wouldn't it bother you to see people you know aren't really there?"" My mother is almost as bad... Some parts of the day she is funny/happy and appears normal. Then she'll turn real mean and all the care center staff know to watch out if she has her cane in hand...


 I believe the descript ion of your mother's behavior would fit the symptoms of Alzheimer's, though I can't say one way or another about seizures. My father had times of clarity and then times when he was incoherent or agitated, and it would cycle, usually due to an underlying infection. His disease affected his organs, causing infections and ramping up the dementia until it was under control with antibiotics. Whenever my father was having an episode where he wasn't acting like himself, his eyes would be glazed over. As to your question regarding testing - has your mother been evaluated by a neurologist? From the Alzheimer's Association: ""There is no single test that proves a person has Alzheimer's. A diagnosis is made through a complete assessment that considers all possible causes."" www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_steps_to_diagnosis.asp"
Husband showing signs of Alzheimer’s and bad behavior,"Today, my husband of 27 years just went completely insane on me, so much in fact, the cops, the ambulance, family, friends, all had to come to my rescue...because he literly tried to ""KILL ME"". I'm 56 years old, he's almost 70 and over the last few years, he's been through cancer, heart attack to losing his colon to a ostomy bag and I have been there for him....all the way. So when I saw him go from this docile nice okay guy to running the streets and living like he's trying to complete a ""bucket list"", I thought nothing of it, I'm figuring this guy is retired, he's just beat cancer, heat attack, that he just wants to have fun....but that fun was turning dangerous.....so I told him that he needs to calm down a bit....the next morning, I'm awaken because he can't find his car keys.....that was at 8am this morning, its now 5am the next morning, he's gone to a hotel, because I had to put him out...he became this monster of a beast, accused me of everything under the sun, I'm in complete shock...he swears I have his keys, he's swears, I forced him to watch porn????, I mean all kinds of crazy crap is coming out his mouth and I'm terrified...like what happened?????? My nightmare is just beggining because I know longer feel safe with him around me...the only reason I thinks its AZ because when the abulance was called, they took him to er and his daughter said that he was just saying all kinds of mean things about me? and the dr's suggested he see his primary care doctor to get a real diagnosis..they all think its AZ... Please are there similar stories out here like this or am I just grabbing for straws....I can't go another round taking care of this guy, I work, I have to take care of my sanity and safety...please help me.","Sherry, he went to a motel last night, because of my feelings of being unsafe. Today our daughter who also lives with us is taking him to see his primary care doctor to see what's really going on. At this point, he is no longer welcomed back into my home. And from what my daughter has said, he's more than willing to move out and go our separate ways. I am percieved as his enemy and he wants to leave....something I wasn't prepared for, but am willing to ablige. I've been his care giver for the last 5 years and I'm tired. I have now got to focus on me and both my mental and physical health....I'm just in a state of shock right now, trying to piece this nightmare together....one day, I'm all is okay and now this?????? I just can't wrap my brains around this sudden maddness.


 There's a part two to this madness.....today his daughter took him in for an evaluation and throughout the process, he keeps accusing me of forcing him to watch ****????????? The telling of this bizzare crap, had the evaluators concerned and suggested he see a psychiatrist.....now whether or not he has ALZ or Demitia, is up in the air, but clearly the guys delusional. I've never done any of the things he keeps accusing me of, never. If anything and this is what's breaking my heart to know end, I've cared for this man for the last 5 years and worked a full time job and my reward is to become the thorn in his side in less than a day???????? My daughter, throughout the day, has called and told me, ""Mom, I can't believe how much daddy hates you"", she called me in tears saying this? How do I adjust to this madness?


 My daughter is telling me that they want to medicate him and set up follow up appointments...but he's refusing. I'm pretty much out of the picture, so I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope he gets what ever help he needs...at this point, I'm done. I'm gonna brush my feelings aside and try to get over this maddness.....praying that I myself don't end up with a depression over this....27 years and out of the blue, the nightmare...no warnings, nothing....its pretty sad. But thanks for all you advice.


 Has your husband actually been diagnosed with Alzheimer's? If the police took him into custody for assaulting you, and this is documented, you may be able to have him committed to a nursing facility if it's documented he has Alzheimer's and attacked you. Your story is similar to something that happened to someone I know. Her husband was diagnosed with Dementia. He tried to strangle her one morning without warning. A neighbor saved her life by calling the police. He wound up on the lock down ward of a nursing home and spent the last several years of his life there. You might want to consult with the doctor involved this case, plus a lawyer if a court order is needed.


 I just got the risperidone and he's taken it......7 hours trying to get this from the doctors hand to the pharmacy.....7 hours!!! I hope this pill calms him down a bit. I'm exhausted and tired. I just found out that I can get a MIW and this will be last resort. Please pray for us and wish us luck


 I do know its a anti psychotic drug and that its suppose to desolve quickly into the blood stream...he's taken the first of many to follow so far and so far, he seem calmer...I guess. He's still festive and always on the go..always doing something...but he seems calmer, I think???? Anyways, I'm still sleeping with knives and protection, I just don't know.


 Sounds like you're in a tough and dangerous situation. Have you talked to his daughter about all this? Is there someone you can stay with?


 Hi, it's just my opinion, but i think your spouse has issues that don't involve dementia. Life threatening problems and major surgery have an effect on people's personalities. He's had several major surgeries for life threatening ailments. Another way of looking at it is he's faced his mortality several times. Making a bucket list doesn't sound like he has memory issues. He's made a lifestyle list and he will protect that list to the point of theatening you. He needs counceling, but you need to protect yourself.


 It sounds like an acute problem rather than a dementia (I have worked in psychiatry for 30 years). That's not to say there is no underlying dementia but he sounds very delusional, so it is prudent to get a psychiatric assessment to screen for other things. Could he have a delirium? Alzheimers tends to come on more insidiously. Fingers crossed for you and hope the assessment brings up something treatable.


 Munch, we're trying to get him in to see a psychiatrist, but we can't make the appointments, he has to be the one???? Which is never gonna happen, please what can I do to force this guy into getting medicated so that we can breath again.....please help us


 You don't need a lawyer if the police grab him. A few words from a doc and an understanding Judge and DA can get him committed to a ""loony bin"" for evaluation. It took my sister a year to get our dad into an assisted living place. First week there he walked out and into a neighborhood across the street. He scared some poor lady to death.. It was almost funny how the police knew where he came from. Few hours later he was admitted to a State run mental hospital (loony bin-my words). He's been in a full lock down facility ever since.


 If it's anything like prozac, it can take several days for it to kick in.


 Oh, bless your heart! First off, if it's a sudden change like this, and a once loving husband suddenly wants to kill you or accuses you of terrible things, know that your husband cannot help it. He's dealing with a medical problem. My dad, our Alzheimer's patient, had a sudden turn similar to this, and it turned out that he had a raging infection that affected his brain, heart, about everything, all that on top of what had been mild Alzheimer's symptoms. He suddenly forgot that my mother had died and was asking where she was. I eventually called an ambulance and he was hospitalized. Any time an elderly patient gets an infection, especially with dementia, this can happen, according to his doctors and hospital staff. When he first started this episode my brother took to him to a doctor who dropped the ball big-time, putting him on lorazepam which made Daddy worse. Said brother then brought him to me because they couldn't control him, and left. A few harrowing days later, waiting for an appointment to a different doctor, he became unmanageable and we then called an ambulance. He didn't know what he was doing and it wasn't his fault, but it still can be dangerous when they're like this. Did they run any tests to check for underlying infections or other non-psychological tests? Has he seen a neurologist? His family physician or someone needs to get him into a neurologist ASAP if not. You should NOT be staying alone with him under these circumstances. Whether it's Alzheimer's or another illness doesn't matter; he most likely doesn't know what he's doing, but he could kill you or someone else just the same. For both your sakes, he needs to be evaluated by a competent neurologist, not just a psychiatrist."
How do people die from Alzheimer's?,"I found this very short article this morning (posted after Gene Wilder's death from Alzheimer's) that explains what dying from complications due to Alzheimer's means. My father's complications, like several of the ones mentioned in the article, caused his death before his memory had completely faded: http://www.livescience.com/55925-gene-wilder-alzheimers-death.html","Interesting read. Thanks for sharing, JaSanne! When the average person thinks of Alzheimer's, all they think of are the effects it has on one's memory. However, there are so many other more physical effects this disease has on the body. This article does a great job of informing readers that Alzheimer's is so much more than memory loss.


 My 86 year old mom was recently diagnosed with advanced bladder cancer. My sister and I looked at each other and said great. Do we put her through hell to try and fix that so she can die a horrible death from Alzheimer's? I have since learned a new term.... Instead of DNR (do not resuscitate) I learned about ""AND"" - Allow Natural Death.


 JerryRosen, that's horrific. It is true that in the very final stages of Alzheimer's, people can lose control of the muscles that regulate swallowing. However, there are a whole range of alternatives that can be used to ensure a person gets nutrition. If the swallowing deficit is minor, the person can have thickened fluids and a soft diet, with help and supervision with feeding. If more serious, a nasogastric tube (tube inserted via the nose and leading to stomach) or PEG feed (tube inserted directly into stomach) can be used to provide a liquid meal with fortified with all nutrients. The only justification for withholding food would be if it was absolutely clear that your grandfather would die imminently. Then the above measures might be seen as causing unnecessary suffering, or prolonging it. If your grandfather was not in that situation, I can't see any justification for allowing him to starve. Maybe you should speak to a lawyer? Elena


 Thank you that was informative


 You're welcome. That's the thing we learned with my father - he suffered physically from organ failure and it outpaced his memory decline. Before my father was diagnosed, I hadn't really thought about the disease affecting the portions of the brain that control the rest of the body, though I should have.


 Very interesting for sure. My grandpa died from starvation when he had Alzheimers. They told us he just forgot how to swallow. What a terrible way to die."
"Early onset Alzheimers, father in law only in his 60's",My father in law was diagnosed about 6 years ago. He is only in his 60s. He still lives in his home with his wife. But things are getting more difficult. He stopped driving 5 yrs ago. He has lost interest in most of the things he used to do. His biggest issue over the last few years is finding his words and following conversations... Even when its one on one and simple. He putters around the house mumbling to himself. Often looking lost and confused. He used to be very organized and particular about his belongings and now is seemingly more careless and doesn't keep his stuff 'just so' as he always did before. He's often grumpy. He has poor vision and can hardly work the microwave anymore. His wife has to get his clothes out for him and direct him to shower etc... Though he does clean himself and do his personal hygiene on his own. But certainly requires direction throughout the day. Can only be left on his own for a couple hours. We are concerned about when the right time is for him to go into care or bring a worker into the home. My husband seems to think that he will be in care by the end of the year but his mom seems to think its still a couple years. I'm kind of in the middle.... I can see it starting to become tiresome on my mother in law. She also takes care of our daughter and nephew twice a week so its almost like having three kids. We want them to think about the future sooner than later and help them figure out a plan. I'm curious to know how this will all play out.... Any thoughts on how rapidly he could decline? He has clearly taken some backward steps in the last year. It's very sad and I know more challenging times are ahead... Though unsure what to expect. My husband feels like he's already mourned his loss.,"He's not a vet...and we are in Canada so I'm not sure how things are different here with assisted living etc. Hubbys mom would never admit if the kids were too much for her..shes just that kind of person. Which is what I worry about . Kids are her life. She raised three of her own and has run kindergym programs for 20+ years. The kids are what she wants to hold on to..they keep her young and free. But of course she has a husband to take care of and we often remind her to be honest and let us know,if she needs a break. But she is the kind who doesn't ask for help. She just pushes through. One of the strongest women I have ever known. It will be an interesting,couple of years trying to sort it all out. My younger sister in law is still living at home but starts her next semester of college in Sept and feels she needs to get out of the house in order to succeed in her studies but she is riddled with guilt about it. We told her she needs to do what she needs to do and we are here to help support all of them. We may offer our condo to her and offer moving into the house for extra support..but we will have to see what they want.


 Sorry to hear about your father in law... He can stay home as long as his wife can handle him. And you should talk to her about can she handle the two kids or should you make other arrangements. It sounds like he's too advanced to go to an assisted living place. Level three for assisted living is where they will bathe him etc... But they don't lock the place down...He's free to come and go as he pleases. The more expensive Total Care is where he might end up. Total Care in the Dallas area starts at three grand a month.... If he's a vet, there are tons of money you can get to help out.... If he's a vet, odds are there's a huge waiting list.....


 Wow I can relate to your post, my Father is 75, and hasn't had Alzheimers for very long that we know of, but this year has been a difficult one for him. My Mother who is in excellent health takes very good care of him, she does get weary with the constant questions, and repeating herself over and over to him, but she loves him and really has great patience with my Dad. My Dad has lost interest in most things he loved, he used to walk 4 miles every day, and now he doesn't, he loved to read and tinker in his shed, but not any longer, he sets around a lot looking lost and sad which breaks my heart. He constantly worries about my Mother, and she can barely get out of his sight, I know for certain he would never last in any Nursing home. We've discussed this and he will not go, we will take care of him no matter what, he is my Father and he took care of us, now it's our turn to take care of him. I know everyone doesn't have this option due to work, but my Father can't be away from his family he would just give up in a nursing home. This illness breaks my heart, the person you once knew is not the same person, my Father was always such a strong man, a very hard worker, now he looks so frail. Just makes me incredibly sad."
Trouble dealing with feelings of anger,Hi I'm new here and just need to vent a bit. I am currently dealing with my mother in law (mil) who has been diagnosed with Alzheimers. I have been married for 22 yrs and quite frankly she was never very nice to me before her illness. She lives with us. I am having a lot of trouble dealing with my feelings of anger. I work 9+ hours most days I try to do meal prep for my work food she takes the food I make and puts it in her room leaving me nothing for work. My husband and I gave up our bedroom so she can have the largest bedroom with the bathroom. She consistently throws away things that I need. Tonight she threw away my rolling pin. In December she threw away a $3000 check that I requested for a 401k loan before that she threw away a syringe that was the only measurement for my sick cats meds. He is an only child and I am at my witts end. She is not bad enough for her dr to warrant institutionalization because she puts on a good front in public. How does everyone deal with this?,"She is reverting to a CHILD like state of mind. You need to childproof your home etc. You need to find an outlet for your anger... Jogging is something simple and good for you. Make sure your husband is doing more than his fair share of care. She doesn't need to be ""bad enough"" for institutionalization. You/her/the family needs to be able to afford care for her. Was she or her husband in the military?"
Do siblings override a parent w/ Power of Attorney?,"My Dad, who was patriarch of our family for many many years - has loved us all well - has provided for many of us - has had Alzheimers for 3 years, and he has good days and bad days. Short term memory not great, but long term good. He was ill and hospitalized, placed on hospice and was sent home to die. But he didn't die. At this point Mom, whom he married over 50 years ago, who is in 'fair' health, decided she could no longer care for him and placed him in a Memory Care Facility. She sees him a few times a week and my siblings and I often visit as we can. He probably gets an average of 1 visit per day from someone - perhaps there have been a few days with no visits. He has been in memory care for a month. But he realizes he was put out of the home and is very hurt and he wants action. He tried to get to Mom, but she won't flench. Feels more like a divorce to me. She is just done, just short visits in which he usually ruins it by worrying about when she will leave him. He is mad and terribly hurt. Sooooooo every time I visit he makes it clear he does not want to be in the memory care facility and he wants one of his kids to take him. He has a nurse from before he likes and wants to care for him. It is possible for me to do this, but she has POA and I don't believe she will vote for it. He wants a lawyer, and I don't know what to do. Seems like a betrayal to him. I feel in the middle. He is probably mid stage Alzheimers.","I've been through this with both my parents. They both participated in looking at the facilities and for the most part looked forward to moving.. Once there, they both felt like they were abandoned. Mom is the worst. She can't remember that one of us visited yesterday but she can remember we dropped her off to die. (her words of course) To make matters worse, Alzheimer's make them revert to a childlike state and there is no way to ""reason"" with them.... Becoming their parent isn't fun and trying to convince them that they can't live in your home is impossible. They just don't understand that they can't be left home all day while everyone is at work etc... If possible - get a white board/write on calendar that shows who is coming to visit and on what day... It gives them something to look forward to. The staff can help remind them who is coming to visit.


 I'm sorry you are going thru this. It's never easy. Does your mother just have POA or does she have a DPOA as well? DPOA is Durable Power of Attorney and relates to health decisions while POA is mainly only for financial and legal matters.


 So very sorry to read what is going on with your dad. I can't imagine how hard it is for you being caught in the middle. Having to place a parent anywhere is tough. Your mom has the POA & she is the one with legal control over him. You can contact an atty & discuss this situation. However, you need to understand they will look at how mentally competent he is, meaning does he have the mental capabilities to make a legal decision to revoke the current POA & appoint someone else. All of this will have to go through the legal system. Have you discussed any of this with your mom? Take care.


 I have not discussed most of this with my mom yet. She can be dismissive bc she likes to get her way for the most part. She really feels she is in charge of him and this is her ultimate solution. But she is out enjoying her life now (she felt locked up with him before), while he is stuck in the facility. But now she is living well and he feels locked up. I have been trying to decide how much I want to rearrange my family to accommodate my dads wishes. Perhaps a compromising point is just to invite him for the day OR even to stay overnight and see how he does here. Does this make any sense to some of you experienced in this? Something we could do monthly or so. It feels like a midway point that is more realistic for my family, like to do this monthly for him. My mom believes if you take them out it mixes them all up and they have to readjust. I don't know if this is true - what do you all think about this? He is just really sad so that is why I want to figure out some solution.


 Disagreements do happen with family members when it comes to a loved one's care, probably a lot more than one would imagine. I agree with you that it would be good for your father to have a day/overnight visit if his health otherwise allows for it. It would make him feel less confined. My father's facility encouraged us taking him out for visits or just to grab a bite. It would also give you sense of what it would be like to care for him at your home before committing to fighting for him full-time. I can tell you from experience that it's much harder and more stressful than most people think it's going to be. Someone has to be watching your father 24/7. Someone will have to help bathe and feed him. Someone has to make sure he doesn't wander off or injure himself or others when he is confused or frightened. Patients will have underlying physical ailments as their organs become affected by the disease. For example, my father's bladder became chronically infected, which in turn, ramped up his dementia. When that first happened, he urinated anywhere and everywhere in the house. He didn't know what he was doing of course, but it's difficult to handle these episodes in you own home. Keep in mind that your father isn't going to view going to your home as equivalent to going to his own home. Please don't be too hard on your mother, especially if she had been caring for him at home all by herself or with little outside help. Remember, it takes a full-time staff of healthy, younger-than-your-mother adults to care for an Alzheimer's patient without getting fully burned out. Though it may seem like she's uncaring for placing him in a facility against his will, she is as much a victim of this unrelenting disease as he is. You will have to decide whether it's worth the ramifications if you try to override your mother's POA. I understand your dilemma, having been there, and hope you can all come to an agreement that doesn't tear your family apart. Post Edited (JaSanne) : 11/5/2016 5:05:57 PM (GMT-6)"
Mefenamic acid potential cure for Alzheimer’s?,"There has been a study released saying Mefenamic acid cures alzheimers disease in mice. Has anyone here tried this drug? http://www.sciencealert .com/a-painkiller-has-been-shown-to-stop-symptoms-of-alzheimer-s-in-mice I would like to find out a way to get this and try it. Of course, no doctor would prescribe this for me.","I took it for headaches and it works wonders. There's one available under the brand name ponstel. Hopefully it works as well for Alzheimers in humans! Not to be silly, but i think it's prescribed for ""that time of the month"" type stuff and migraines. You could say you've taken it for migraines in the past. I'd say the brand name...


 The article states among other things: ""Plans for clinical human trials are already at an early stage, with scientists working on a proof-of-concept for human neuroinflammation."" It could be years before they ""start"" trials on humans.


 Since I heard that medicine maybe can reverse the Alzheimer's disease symptoms completely, I had tried it for more than nine months since then, I found no way it can be done, though I did feel the medicine does help relieve some symptoms of the Alzheimer's disease by some degree on some aspects, like numbers, languages, logistics and reactions but not in name recognitions, certain kind of memories and Hippocampus functions-short term memories. In all, it does helped me a lot in my daily live, at least so far so good; although more research/trial for human use is underway, it could be years before it can reach a conclusion and prescribed to patients. Hope the researcher can finish the trial and make good for all the suffered people! Be remember, this is not a cure for all medicine, don't expect whole reverse of the Alzheimer's disease symptoms; since when cells died, it's dead forever, nothing can reverse the dead process, the only thing it can be done is to repair those damaged cells due to inflammation and make it work regularly again, that's it! Though this is still a great news but it has it's limitation and should not be treated as a miracle! the Alzheimer's disease is a very complex medical condition, mixed treatment options are required simultaneously, be patient and wait for trial result before firecracker celebration can be fired.

How do caregivers survive this disgusting / pathetic disease?,"Mum has Alzheimer's. Am I annoyed and angry because she says things that are not true and talks behind my back even though I'm the one that is her main carer? Or am I angry that a once strong, independent beautiful woman who had amazing hands, cooking and making beautiful gowns now wets herself and tries to blame the dog? Anger, hatred, confusion, can't find the keys, loses her clothes, leaves food in the fridge for weeks and just walks around the house not know what she is looking for? Saying stupid things that just don't make sense, walking outside 20 times a day just to see if my car is there which means I'm home. Her fear, confusion, anxiety. How can it stop? It can't stop. It will only get worse. How do we, the carers, survive this disgusting and pathetic disease? To watch our loved one's brain just melt into oblivion. How do we keep sane, how do we not think that we are going mad. The constant calling, the anger, the guilt then the sorrow and sadness, the 'please forgive me moment' straight after a moment of wanting to end it all because of the hurt that they inflicted on you. How do you survive such a cruel and confusing state of mind? How? Deep, deep in my hurt and damaged soul I have a light that is still there, it's still alive, that is where it flickers, it will never die, it's just a flicker but it's still there. That is where my strength is.","I cared for my grandmother after she developed dementia from chemo therapy, she always knew who I was but was extremely unpredictable towards my husband, son and especially my daughter who was only 8 at the time. For some reason she was cruel toward my daughter, which in turn caused major upset with her because her once loving grandmother turned on her. Which unfortunately led me to put my grandmother in assisted living. Dementia and AD is an extremely horrible disease. It not only robs the sufferer of their identity but we lose the people we love. I'm sorry you have to go thru this but remember, this is NOT your mother speaking and doing things. She's still in there but she has no control over what she does. As hard as it is, try not to take things personal.


 One of Dad's childhood friends has been succumbing to it more in recent months. My dad has been his designated care taker and manages his estate though only in name as John, my dads friend, hasn't really needed the help. but after a recent event John isn't able to live on his own anymore and so my dad has been helping him more and more. John doesn't seem to notice the change in his life and is adapting quickly. My dad is another story...pretty tough on him. because of that we all try to help when and how we can. It tough but you're doing the right thing. and your frustration is normal. Its helpful to express it especially if you have a support group


 Thank you so much For your kind words Alice. Mum does have carers in nearly every day and is on anti-depressants. I am definately going to seek help at the Alzheimers support group. Family? Yes i have a brother who pops in every day for 15 minutes. He sees nothing of what goes on but I understand that he can only do what he can do. I really appreciate your support. Thank you.


 Being a Care Giver for a Patient with many different diseases. is a TOUGH job. Most people think about the Patient . .""Oh Poor Joe"" ""He has Alz. and doesn't know whats going on"". Let me tell ya, it's much tougher on the care giver and family. We are in the process now of organizing our family, and responsibilities to take care of father-in-law with AD. There is soo much involved, and not just the difficulty of finding home health care help, but Power of Attorney, Medicare, secondary insurance, insurance limits, assets, income.... Keeping documentation organized is a full time job. Good Luck in your journey, and do all you can . . stay strong!"
I have been forgetting words,"Hi every one, I'm new on here. I am a 78 year old male and recently had 3 stents fitted. Gave me my life back. Right, reason for my message is that for the past year or so, I have been forgetting words and, what have I gone for etc. I have seen my GP who gave me a test and said it is not dementia, just old age. My daughter and grandson are driving me mad and watching like hawk. I know they care but it is too much so I have been Googling and come up with that I should take turmeric and black pepper together with a table spoon of olive oil. The oil is to enable the turmeric and pepper to enter the blood stream and revitalise areas of the brain. What I am trying to find out is how long to take effect and is it safe ? Regards Keith","I've read hundreds of articles about dementia and have never seen the concoction you mentioned. If you're not already doing it - walking a few miles every day will do wonders for every part of your body. Did your GP ask you question like ""have you ever driven somewhere and not remembered how to drive back home?""


 Hi Keith, sorry to read about the grief you are dealing with from family members. My husband is 74 & his memory is not the sharpest either, it's part of normal aging, not dementia. Something I will share with you, our son always looked at his dad as his hero. Dad was someone that could fix anything, build anything & was a perfectionist. He does forget things. My son says mom, I hate seeing dad this way, I always envision him being on the ball & I must remind myself dad is getting older. It's hard for family to sometimes remember parents age. Do not let family dictate this. Get a note from your dr that states you have old age, not dementia. There is a huge difference between old age & dementia! Before taking supplements such as you described, I urge you to visit with your local pharmacist before taking anything like you mentioned. You don't want to take something that may have adverse effects. A good pharmacist may be able to guide you on a product that may help. What may work for one, may not work for someone else. Keep in mind, our drs are not trained to learn about supplements, your pharmacist is your best source. Please stay off of Dr Google, he is rarely right. Take care.


 As mentioned by others, your status is normal for a 78-year old person. And the fact that you wrote your sensible post proves that. But I would be very weary of the supplements you are thinking about . Just eat sensibly for a person with heart issues. Talk to your cardiologist for advice on the latter."
Putting an Alzheimer's patient into a care facility,"I've spent some time on the RA board and it's my first post over here. My husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a couple of years ago and I'm taking the steps to place him in a memory care facility. If anyone has experience with this, I'd love some insight as to how to handle the situation with the patient. My husband's short-term memory is almost non-existent and I can't imagine trying to tell him ahead of time. However it feels sneaky to just take him and move him in without discussion. I know there's not easy answer, but just hearing how others have handled this will help me to decide what my best course of action is. Thanks.","Thanks for the reply and the support. I'm sorry you've had such a hard time with your dad. This disease sucks. DH is a vet - how do you go about contacting the VA regarding funding?


 Thanks, Michael. I am pretty new to this and haven't found all of the resources yet.


 Thanks again, Michael.


 My father went into an Alzheimer's unit within a local nursing home, which made it much easier for him since we were there often. The unit was designed where one could not just wander or sneak off as it had a near one-to-one staff/patient ratio who were constantly with the patients, the doors could only be accessed with a code or someone letting you in or out, just for patient safety. They had an outdoor garden area just for them that was encompassed by the home's walls, but the patients could be taken anywhere within the building and grounds as long as someone was with them, and of course we could sign him in and out to take him home, the doctor, to eat out, etc. When my father was placed there, he had been hospitalized with a severe infection which ramped up his dementia. The Alzheimer's effect on his major organs somewhat outpaced the dementia and he improved mind-wise once the infection subsided but needed the constant medical care that we could no longer do at home. Daddy hated it at first, but he was gregarious by nature and with his medications helping stabilize him, he came to enjoy his time there and he was able to leave the Alz. unit and be in a regular room after a few months, and with the use of an ankle bracelet that would set of an alarm if he went through the door by himself. He had spent the last ten years of his life caring for my mother who had Parkinson's and even in the nursing home, when he was feeling better physically, he would do things for others, especially getting coffee for his roommate. When he worked, he would make the coffee in the office before he would make his rounds in the plant and he sort of carried that with him, making his rounds checking on people in their rooms. He would even ask to go into the Alzheimer's unit to check on other patients he had come to know. And he loved singing as the words to songs were still there in his mind. He could hardly breathe with his COPD, but he would still sing hymns every week, though his ability to read had pretty much left him. He was an avid newspaper reader before all this, so I had his paper delivered to the home and even though he couldn't read more than the headlines, the paper kept him anchored to the days of the week and it was a habit he was used to at home. Little things can make a difference. I know it can feel like you're abandoning a loved one when it comes time for placement, but it's not. I know Daddy's case was probably not typical, but I know his quality of life improved at the home. The facility he was in was not fancy, but it was clean and had a good staff. We could visit any time, call any time and he could call us. He passed away 2 years ago from aspirational pneumonia after he lost the ability to swallow. I miss him, but I know we did the right thing. I hope you can find a good facility for your husband, and try not to feel guilty about doing what needs to be done for both of you. -Joy


 Carole, the VA Medical Hospital or Clinic nearest to you should be able to get you the paperwork you will need to apply for help from them. If the patient is not ""Service Connected"" it's based on income, household income. Just a tidbit of information there .. Also, everything you send to them, set up a file, make a copy for your file, and always send Certified Mail and staple the receipt to your copy. If you have not been approved within 1 year, you must refile. If you don't, and you are due back $$, it will only be paid as far back as an active claim. The medical services are easier to get than VA Disability. Good Luck - stay strong!


 Carole - the good news is that he'll forget why he's mad at you... But it'll be a daily struggle for a while. My dad ""was"" looking forward to going to an assisted living center... A few weeks before he was going to move we took his car away from him. He didn't last a week in the assisted living center... He escaped and scared some lady with a small child that lived across the street.... So he got locked up in a psych ward for three weeks. I picked him up on Friday and had him on a plane 10 hours later from Dallas to Tampa to stay with my brother. Two weeks later he was in a full memory care center. My brother and his wife are very active and visit him several times a week.... They also take him out for lunch and dinner visits. Lying to him about visiting Florida wasn't easy or fun... He finally got over the fact that I wasn't coming to get him... But that was after he got adjusted to where he was. Lucky was us three kids is that pops is a VET. Between the VA money and SS, we were able break even on costs....and the center is fairly close to where my brother lives.... Good luck to you..

 Thanks for taking the time to share your story, Joy. It always helps to hear from others who have gone through this."
Anyone using coconut oil with good results?,Anyone using coconut oil with good results,"MCT Oil, Coconut Oil, Piracetam and a few other things are pretty good at helping people with neuro-degenerative (Senile Dementia, Dementia, Amnesia, and Alzheimer's) diseases or conditions. I've seen a few people on forums that recommend it from having their family members/friends use it and see positive results regarding it.


 Coconut oil has been use to help people with Alzheimer's disease. The principal is to allow the brain to run on fat rather than sugar. Sugar is very destructive to the body.


 Google-> coconut oil and Alzheimer's And you'll find many articles... This article mentions a ""couple of tablespoons."" Coconut Oil and Alzheimer's Is the Misguided Low-fat Dietary Philosophy Primarily Responsible for Alzheimer’s Disease? coconutdiet.com/alzheimers.htm


 I had the same question! Thanks! I'm going to try this with my mother. Please update if anyone has positive results. :O)


 What did you have in mind? I hear that it's a great skin moisturizer.


 My mom ate a jar worth and nothing happened.
